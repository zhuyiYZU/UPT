But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my system but on 5.25 disks.  I hate using 5.25 disks so I copied them over to high density 3.5's using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In fact for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer when you're switching printer emulations around. Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with but when a friend's system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the originals and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton c:\nu would create a workable backup and if you did a full install the first time you've got the whole thing.

Thanks. A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible however to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip also available on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the normal keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

Gawd it's only been two and half years. How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck??? Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed?

"1","I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB. When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 everything is fine but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows AutoCAD GIFs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4 bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back this is a pain in the ass and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So if anyone has had this same problem please let me know if you know what to do.  Hell let me know if you don't have a solution just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance. Jude M. Greer jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen it just starts to cut off the top and bottom."

"1","Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in. Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it. It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then maps the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can cd to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor! So I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-) John -- John Gayman WA3WBU UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH"

At least : locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and : he has to fix it. Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell.

Kinda fun.  8) First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom. Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 If the last 3 digits are 013 you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (- represents jumper) >	W1	1-2 3 >       W2      1-2 3 >	W3	1-2 >	W4	1 2-3 >	W5	1 2 3 >	W6	1-2 3 >	W7	1 2 3 Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: (8 represents jumper) Looks right. [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other? I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom set it like this: 5 + +    open 6 + +    open 7 + +    open 8 + +    open 4 + +    closed 3 + +    closed 2 + +    open 1 + +    open Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 34 and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 12 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1). If you have the 62-000094 rom it's a auto-config and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here. >2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly? See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also  at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251 try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade? Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter: -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt) This will return the rom date if it's of any use. >Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above I appologize.

WD1004A-27X feature F300R - Half-slot size hard disk controller  with an ST506/ST412 interface.  It supports 2 RLL drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built-in ROM BIOS supports non-standard drive types virtual drive formatting bad track formatting and dynamic formatting. NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not boot.  To solve this problem one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using). -2- NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1 WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers models SX TX and the original or A version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5 the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the modification a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

"1","Help.... I need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3 and COM4. I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4 shares IRQ3 with COM2 except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how. Please answer by email to :- neil@stone.oz.au thanks in advance Neil Watkinson."

"1","Hi All I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters et.c. Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non-trivial data to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off typeamatic specs.) from inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above which wouldn't look too neat besides what would one do from an XT?) Great thanks in advance Andrew."

"1","Please help if you can with the following strange problem: The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to time for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or something the like). Unfortunately I cannot just reproduce the error. Sometimes it occurs more often sometimes less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to demonstrate some software to a colleague. I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it.

"1","Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer configuration is : 486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz) 16MB Ram ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk SCSI UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk performance in that system do I need that ? A guy I know gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec and he has an ST3283A and a ISA 486DX-50 how can a ISA with the same system be faster ? Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?

If you are considering buying one or the other definitely go for the DX with a nice size external cache!  The performance is far greater. The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz while the DX has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither systems could actually run a program out of main memory since DRAM is still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ). -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I can tell you that mixing them between 'banks' ok and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ) here is the two equivalent configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM interface they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry if too techie for ya]. MG>> 	Similarly one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots) can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ?? That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit wide SIMMs you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask? Simple  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit CPU ( 386DX or 486 ) the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data from memory ) is 32-bits wide so the computer expects to see 32 bits when it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ) the motherboard links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data but parity so I will ignore that in this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you have a 16-bit bus two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide data which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide and 32-bit banks are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bits used in some PS/2s and ASTs ) you could upgrade by one SIMM at a time. Hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your question was not simple.  I could of just said 'because I said so.' -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean cache speed is one thing but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O so just get that faster... I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)! regards JV ///// name:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ] address: gildelaar 4                                            \_=_/ 4847 hw teteringen                                     _| |_ holland                  e-mail:  volkert@kub.nl      / \_/ \ _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__"

No rumour IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last fall (COMDEX or something I wasn't there). All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU just like 486SX that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel don't you? It has 16K of internal cache which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99 but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software"

Try another vendor I wish I had. While others here may have had better experiences I too share the sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM it is only relatively recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing mis-drawn check boxes etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01. If there's a more recent release I'd appreciate if someone would drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their BBS lately to check again.  Naturally Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases. Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the right person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not confirmed the validity of that statement. When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some form of local bus) I'll seek a video solution from someone other than Diamond.

"1","Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS using C++ to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085. I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character if a 0x20 is received the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17 monitors (also a newly available) and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board. Do not buy a 486SX sytem. My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models. Gordon"

"1","Howdy Sorry if this has been covered before: One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course I said No problem and went to work. Unfortunately the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC)... Thanks in advance Paul Mr. SCSI... NOT! Fincke"
"1","I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am running Linux as my main OS with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games. My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS and (120+100)Mbyte IDE. Basically I have two choices 1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486. Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25. I have a couple of questions. 1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS and alot of Floating Point operations. 2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ? Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? Any experiences will be most helpful ... Kenny. PS.

Does he have to use new parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? When it comes to local dealers: - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their techs are re-treaded salesmen not trained technicians with a high turnover rate. - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously. - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply or even done period unless you are on a paid service contract. Having been both a service technician and a service manager at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place I know what I'm talking about. I also know the local service scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service. Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service including overnight replacement parts on-site calls etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good service you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can. - Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)"

Some background about my PC: - American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM - config.sys file: device=c:\dos\himem.sys dos=highumb device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems files=30 buffers=30 stack=9256 - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c - CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram. The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31 I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. Run excel no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows. Ok I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them: - Stack fault by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure by ndw.exe at same address Some how the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means? I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat no help. Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. -------------- Steve Chu AT&T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ"

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use slower RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash. Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM. Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of Illinois Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set. Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels? If you have not yet open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base. As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker? Anyhow If the tape has the holes then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape. If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out. If it is still in warranty you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair. --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil Standard disclaimer: The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

No help there. Then not having anything better to try I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards. I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila! the PC booted from power up although it seemed to take several seconds before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns. O.K. with this additional information does anyone in netland have any words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it? -Larry still (un)plugging away Byler-"

"1","Hello I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have 8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie. both banks are full and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows and I know that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS the only solution I can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180 and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather avoid... So my question is do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work how do they do it?  Is a device driver needed or will the BIOS pickup the extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits so probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly appreciated. -Eric ebosco@us.oracle.com"

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for! V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster. This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory. Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other two. How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.

If we are >only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently >faster at managing data from a hard drive. You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only} some monitors and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports. IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max. So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost} SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put."

It must be able to run Unix. What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a quality stuff? What are other important features ? Monitor: I want a 14 non interlaced svga but not sure about what brand to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider? Acer? Touch? What else should I ask? Video Card: I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of V-RAM? One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal? Hard Drive: Segate Western Digital Conner all have the same price. Which one is more liable? which one has better performace? Case/power supply: Given the choise of desktop and minitower which one is better? What is the adequate power supply? Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue? What features should I ask for? Did I miss anything? I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group. Your help is greatly appreciated. Jason Chen"

"1","I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well and is working fine but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup. The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0 The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head 300 write_pre 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally the drive in the machine had none.  Currently I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave. When booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error. Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive I would not even know how to do that. Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not a number for Western Digital might just do as good! swood -- Hunting over in Michigan?

The scenario: 1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller 2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy) 3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy) 4 - Call Gateway receive the correct controller in 5 days (getting happier) 5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again) 6 - Call Gateway again get another controller in 5 more days (cooling off the end is in sight) 7 - This controller doesn't work either motherboard is bad (VERY unhappy) Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) and have on-site service install it for me. BUT I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So the whole thing is going back. I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer. I would really like to try Gateway again I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?

"1","Hello I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec 1542A controller. Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located. Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system' even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).

Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software. Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS and later Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x the number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc. Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore IBM is including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1). Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2. So far IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read comp.os.os2.misc for details). Proposed Charters: (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and spur additional development.  The group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS Windows UNIX etc) toolkits which aid in program portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors) and so forth. (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting. (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics including the availability of device drivers compatibility information installation procedures system requirements and overall performance optimization. (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues. (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports bug diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system patches and corrective service disks and so forth. [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other newsgroups and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in comp.os.os2.beta] How to Vote: To cast your vote fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me. Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this post.  Be sure to send only the ballot and edit out the rest of this post. 1)  Type in your vote for each proposal: If you favor the charter as proposed put a yes after its name. If you oppose the charter as proposed put a no after its name. To abstain leave a blank after its name. 2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name) a comma and your first name (i.e. your personal name). 3)  Cut out the ballot  Please do not delete any lines of the ballot. 4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) April 24 1993. Ballot: ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---- (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: (f)       voter's last first name: e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24 ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---------------- Example Ballot #1: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no (f)       voter's last first name: Smith John In this example John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting to be created and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. Example Ballot #2: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes (f)       voter's last first name: Doe Jane In this example Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all the proposals. Voting Rules: * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once only the most recent vote will be counted. * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting forwarding posting votes to a newsgroup etc. will not be counted. * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings will be revealed only after the poll closes. * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will post the ACK twice (see Schedule below). * If you need help for using your editor using e-mail how voting works in general etc. then ask an expert at your site. Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is posted to news.answers on a regular basis. * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this CFV send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu. * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below) a proposal passes if both of the following formulas are true: 1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100 or YES - NO >= 100). 2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO or YES - NO >= NO). In other words a proposal passes if: YES - NO >= max (100 NO) where max() returns the highest number given to it. Schedule: The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator). This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV but it also has the Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you have not voted yet vote now! The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) on April 24 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count. The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that date. Mass Acknowledgement: Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15 1993: bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari Sanjay

"1","Hi I just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy.  This thing has every port known to man on the back. The question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC. What hardware is needed? Software? TIA Alex P.S. please respond directly.  I am not on this alias."
"1","I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced which seems like a good deal. However it is a fixed-scan rate monitor and only handles 52 kHz horizontal I think.

"1","While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts I found a half-size board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC and ran Advanced diagnostics several times changing the jumper positions each time but the system did not recognise a comm port. Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it? I could use another comm port if it's free. Bryan"

"1","Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say Buy the memory from us or something like that.) The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects. So to get to the point finally ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken. If you want these modes steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB) at least until their developers are less busy.  If the magazines are to believed I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?) although evenn that might be a misprint. Please if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL. Thanks. donyee@athena.mit.edu"

"1","> My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ 5 which is > unreserved in contemporary computers (using IRQ 5 for the > drives went out with the XT architechture ... ) Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt. On the other hand we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1 a Mouse on COM2 and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5 and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3 our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work. ~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)"

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.

"1","This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard. I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr 7 days/wk) and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company. I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc. Thanks very much in advance for any information. -- Mohammad Al-Ansari"

You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me believing that the 250 logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity. The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it marketing.

This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours particularly if the tape is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for the write is too small.

This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration file for the tape system.

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE inteface for any non-card non-modem not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross drive interfacing as fast as the OS program CPU SCSI and drive can handle it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}. In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well. Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers scanners expandsion cards {this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'} CD-ROM etc. IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface {Make of that what you will} SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE. This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water. Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago {When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI off into the statosphere price wise} SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces {at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}"

"1","Hi I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive. I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE drive. I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any mention of it in the manuals. My system config is: i486DX/33 4Mb Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE Any help would be appreciated Thanks Ron.

"1","It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick. I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features. For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy. Just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up down left etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know much beyond that. -- Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality Winnipeg MB Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinks chrstie@ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant. |  they're useful to society"

However just in case something went wrong I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly. * MSDOS configuration: The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive (this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up. * Windows configuration: To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows make sure that the [388Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry: VirtualHDIRQ=Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you you might want to try adding some more lines: VirtualHDIRQ=Off SystemROMBreakPoint=false EMMExclude=A000-CFFF (You probably don't need the above lines though.)  The SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs). * Windows 3.1 runs slowly: Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542 chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not it's probably because: 1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a winning solution. 2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen .... If your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 (SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS) you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other solutions. Unfortunately you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following: 1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by a bug in Smartdrive. 2. Use a driver that provides VDS services (VDS stands for Virtual DMA Services).  This is a standard which is supported by Windows 3.1 that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like the 1542) to work with Windows. After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following solutions none of which require using Smartdrive (note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster: 1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver or you do not need ASPI functions (for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc.) you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 (Windows needs the /V386 option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory) and it occupies about 16-20K.  As of November 1992 the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully it's still there). 2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver version 3.0 or 3.0a you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 Amazingly enough the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support about this and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW. On my system NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE the default Windows shell and vice-versa.  This is the reason SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary. I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0. Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider these people lucky.  Others like me have had all sorts of problems. 3. In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer needed.  Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know there are only three ways to get a copy: * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other drivers such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is around $75. * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around $30. * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1. Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem. ***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices: There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250: 1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc. 2. Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors. (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542.) * Tape backups/restores take a long time: If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 bus on/off timing for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause.  However the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary. The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is too large.  For example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory) not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough. The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on and 5 microseconds off. The bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways: * If you have ASPI4DOS you can use the /n option.  For example I use a bus on timing of 4 microseconds which means that I use the following line in my CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4 Note that there is NO space between the /n and the 4. * If you don't have ASPI4DOS your only recourse is to try to find a program called SETSCSI.EXE which is very difficult to find.  The reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have it.  If you do find a copy you run it like so: setscsi -n:4 This adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds.  Running SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults. Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS however. Do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little. Once you've lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster. Also do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described) unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh. A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while) this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However when I tried running this program with my 1542A my system crashed.  At the time I was running SCSIHA.SYS and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B although the docs say that it works with the 1542A? * Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors: This problem may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542. Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head: 1. Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup. 2. Tape backup works but the tape compare fails. 3. The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc. much too often. Unlike the above-mentioned problem (Tape backups/restores take a long time) where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so. 4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the tape drive but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot. 5. Too many tape read errors. Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago I upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542 I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive. I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542 which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542.  On the other hand the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542.  I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however if you're having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller. ***** Sound cards: Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error.  Usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware. I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g. higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using 16-bits instead of 8 etc.). Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's bus on timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note however that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e. some software is inefficient).  Disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this. ***** Miscellaneous info: This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk. * With QEMM 6.00 6.01 and 6.02 you need to specify the DB= parameter (e.g. DB=2) unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver. If you don't QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line (at least this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter but I'm not sure (I've never used a version earlier than 6.00). If you use ASPI4DOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB= parameter. * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB you need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec. * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542 you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package which lists for something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you need. 2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc.  I do not know the list price but I've seen this package sold for around $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS driver which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead. 3. [This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit but I'm mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver) if it is not included in the ASW-410 kit but this is available from several bulletin boards. * To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542 you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are (again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup. 2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more details).  However note that CorelSCSI! does not come with but requires ASPI4DOS. * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations: 1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS. 2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers. 3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and CorelSCSI! drivers/programs. I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration: 4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI drivers). * Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used this version of GNU tar but I've heard that it works (I don't know how well though).

However the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical and there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work with a 1542A but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of BSD Unix). * In case anyone's curious here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file: FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGHUMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.

"1","I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more you now get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago when I bought this pkg. it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos."

XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think).

"1","I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system: 486-33 DX 16 mb of ram on a Novell 3.11 network Monitor:  NEC 4FGe capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate Major considerations: I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word processing database and communications--not much intensive graphics. With a 15 monitor I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256 colors seems plenty but I'd like like the image to be sharp fast and rock solid. Other considerations: I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers. I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking. I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later).

Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning (the problem I had) others poor focus etc etc. I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. It's now clear well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly a Trinitron (say) would be much nicer but that's well out of my price range. Conclusion: If you're on a budget get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it but has good potential. Chris"

"1","------------------------------------------------------------------------- Netters! I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's but that's not really relevant at the moment. I've been offered the following CD-ROM players for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor please give your opinions on the drives i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq. I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

"1","I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4). Well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters. What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? -- ............................................................... :      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : : Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              : : Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park NC : ..............................................................."

Several others here also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate appears ok for me but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of spending money with the size of today's files etc a tape backup is certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost."

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find corrupted files but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? As might be expected I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything (and hoping that will fix the problem) but I would like to have some assurance of what the problem cause is. Also can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)?

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}. The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices slower through put} From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for 20% faster then IDE that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1 far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip. The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the 20% faster then IDE came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port electronic controller etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes. When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }"

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed 20% faster than IDE {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)} Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip {Not at a 6MB/s 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}. Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on. One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is (Digital Review Oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))."

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? : If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think) but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS. The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient. We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though). I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several. Gordon Lang"
"1","I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future Domain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller. The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices). The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found. The system hangs if all three (Tandberg Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system. Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.

I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many things about pc in general. So what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ? I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256 colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes. Any suggestion ?? thankyou in advance Paolo Silvera -- Certified Commodore Amiga developer silvera@ghost.sm.dsi.unimi.it"

"1","I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17 Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results. In going with the modern trend the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia though which the S3 cards just printed as hash which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported. The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic' and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either. The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386 ISA so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486 33 MHz AIR motherboard (UMC chipset) with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit. K means thousand (not 1024) M means million pixels per second Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me.... I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my company. geoff sherwood"

"1","Hi Netters! I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario: 1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive). The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / restore program.  Both systems have 3.5 and 5.25 floppies. 2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon). From what I have seen so far there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these options I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y etc.) in my thinking (I don't know very much about these beasts): 1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system. Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand? What do the floppies themselves cost? 2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again can someone recommend a few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)? 3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?) 4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again any gotcha's or recommendations for manufacturers? I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.

You send a command to the port to read it then you time how long it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously since time is used as a position you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste of time.

At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver. So should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number? Any assistance appreciated.

"1","Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again I forget the model number but I can find out.) Anyway I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected) but not both at the same time; whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master the new 210MB one is the slave). The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations: controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave None of them worked.  Unfortunately I can't think of any others. Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C: drive and D: drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things? So I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost! Many many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!

"1","Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up. Previously when I first start up my PC I can see all the CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again the display works as normal like before. Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet. I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.

My 2 cents worth: The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. A speaker being a coil it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach. Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard. LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light power off reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work. If it does then attach the turbo switch to the board. Hope this helps. Dan Moyer Dan.Moyer@ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM"

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something much more elementary. Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and an initial directory. If you have a small disk (50 meg or less) I would recommend that it remain a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

No that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper. : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.

No actually we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.

On a single drive SCSI is more expensive.  But you bought your PC for expandibility so you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE: A (partial?) list: 1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently. 2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) 3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For instance recently I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will work no other way.  On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes. 4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once. One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full but it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card. Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE.

Anyway he now he would like to put another HD into this system.  I DON'T want to buy another MFM the only reason why I used an MFM in the first place is that it was FREE.  Would I need a special IDE HD controller?  Also if I do need a special IDE controller where can I purchase one & how much are they?

If the keyboard is left idle in Dos for more than 15 minutes I can type on the command line but as soon as I hit a carraige return the computer locks up.  This will happen almost every time whether I've just booted up reset or finished using a dos program.  Everything works fine if I don't let it sit.  Windows is a different story.  If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes or more it does not freeze up.  However  I do get frequent application errors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly losing my work.

"1","I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k ( v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem at the other machine is a Turbomodem+ from The Complete PC (the machines are in seperate houses so a direct serial link is impossible and copying this much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines on for a few hours and go see a movie--no this is not pirated software). I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to set the comm at 19k2 38.4k or 56kbps the stupid thing connects but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k). His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART so that's not the problem. It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to a comm program _at_ 14.400bps even though it will take dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK etc. to other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can do precisely 14.4k. I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it any way in particular? Also it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting here (i.e. at 9600 since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far) but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.

(at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms. Is there any argument that IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. If data is going from one drive to another and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?

If they had a common (read: >easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or >Mac) then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice. So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice. >: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented >: data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better >: (than IDE on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when >: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. > >On a single drive SCSI is more expensive.

(jumpers set IRQ 14/15 hw port addr 1F0/170 and BIOS addr CC00/C800 and other floppy/format stuff) Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI or even from HD is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - ---  --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron and can change a chip or put a jumper!

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents... The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems. A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or at least do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group. Its a long story but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines.  If and when SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines I plan to completely get rid of IDE. -- Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best. Palm Bay FL.

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it but DOS (at least) won't.

Since my budget is $2350 for a system it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it IS too good to be true of course). Among other things I've never seen a review of the Budget systems (or their parent company Micro Smart) or of the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be appreciated. In a similar vein the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14 MI monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well. Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities. Email response would be greatly appreciated.

This is what all this is about.  Do you >get more performance for the money. Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: >IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s. Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower {Range 0-5MB/s} >ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {}) PC Magazine April 27 1993:29 Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE... {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI one third the speed of IDE... or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI 20% faster than IDE... NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity. SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)} If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2} IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE."

The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives and monitor.  The floppies are 360k and the monitor is CGA but you will need an adaptor cable to use it.

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk and REM out the Adaptec drivers. Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work. Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun. The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

"1","Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5. (The card is revision 5A) My detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part of the ISA bus. The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X what does the manual claim that this jumper does? To anyone with an ISA-reference what is the function of the BALE line? On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?

I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor.

If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only work as the first or second drive.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I have seen a similar situation before.

Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will > allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts? Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software) COM1 on IRQ3 SoundBlaster on IRQ5 LPT1 on IRQ7 and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great. If you need even more there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus. It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the first IRQ serviced by the system giving the modem a better response -- especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

With I/O overlap your CPU can continue to think while disk operations are underway whereas without overlap your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity* compared to a fast CPU. So when you've got multi-tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do. One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes with no DMA. -- Richard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along..."

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence IDE *is* ISA on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock 16 bit width 5MB/sec. This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way then it's not compatible.

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned they are adjusted to factory-spec before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15 monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps rough handling and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor (the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my case quite :). >Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? I for one was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect IMHO but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was normal). The short answer is no don't accept these imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors one has a right to expect higher quality and if you're persistent you'll receive it. >............................................................... >:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : >: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              : >: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park NC : >...............................................................

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from? SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip the port and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point. SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY} asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s} synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.} SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s} SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external device. Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2. Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst. SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this requires: SCSI-2 driver software wide SCSI-2 port and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software the controler chip and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}"

"1","Hi I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone claims..) Anyway.. 1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use.. 2) Secondly does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ?? 3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8) 4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... For instance using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary... I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll suspect not .. 5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant?????? As a follow on does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls 0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to screen memory in terms of portability? Many thanks.. Gotta go bars closing soon 8) Cheers Ian"
"1","Fellow netters I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices. Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also. Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE. I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149). Basically I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy? If you have a hand scanner please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. - Kevin Harter"

Reamy (mreamy@rock.concert.net) >The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon. One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao the F550iW which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows I reviewed several monitors including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi and it scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect. Incidentally one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product whether it's monitors or mice is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done and on what the scores are based you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring. Wayne Rash"

There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems so you'll have to get it from someone else. However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know the speed buffering works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board. Hope this helps...

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time. Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense."

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways so there probably isin't a problem with this) Besides like I said before the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2.

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very poorly written.

Very possibly but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is. From what I've seen the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz intelligent bus (ie bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like not jumpers...)

"1","Greetings Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension) and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386. The station has a power supply two floppy disk drives and the big case. I have SONY 1304 monitor SyQuest drive (Mac) and maybe a cd-rom reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW I need to buy a keyboard for it too. Any input is welcome. Thank you. Peter Liu"

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called. Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock). Mark Aitchison University of Canterbury."
"1","Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and pronounced the disk drive unusable. My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders 9 sides). When CMOS set this way COMPSURF runs happily with 13 bad blocks. I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive. Install will proceed successfully but when I try to boot the server it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware. Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit). Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors. Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk yes? So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured? 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides. Thanks for your time. Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before.

"1",">How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus? By initiating a DMA xfer.  :) Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower). ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or crash.(I forget) Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit. The system uses DMA 0 a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1. I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA. In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers. I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either. I do know that on EISA/MCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel. Thanks."
"1","They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use IRQ7!. The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7 then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7. Note this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!. Windows may be a different story...."

"1","Hai In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard. It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is. I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around. My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it so I consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things: - How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2 Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example) - What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it support (text & graphics) - How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM - Compatibility with old TSENG 4000 - Support in software If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell me about it. For the people in Holland: Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam! Thanks in advance			Erik Stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)"

Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day. You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips memory etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save a few cents here and there in electricity bills but it won't look like much when it come time to fix your computer. My $.02 worth.. N. Ngo"

"1","Hi all I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is: * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD * SCSI(2) Interface * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B * Does not need any caddies * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible) * Double Speeded I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions are sorted by my priority. I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive but it DOES satisfy almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible with 1542B adapter. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance KobayashiMasaoki (masaoki@tky.hp.com)"

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance I'll be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards arrive I'll buy one. >Personally my system at home needs a new disk subsystem a much >larger monitor a super-fast graphics board by you-know-who a new >CPU board -- I probably won't keep much more than the case and the >mouse.

My case has slots for 8 and I'd like to : get a scanner but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out! : I'm hoping that a simple solution exists e.g. an adapter that turns I'm not sure if this will work but how about using one of those 'T' expanders used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot and then (probably) have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low profile cases - a standard motherboard the 'T' connector in one slot and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more. The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics on it.  The only downside - your case won't close but for a homebrew system that may not be a problem. Don't know about performance though.

"1","Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine and very nice it is too. One query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz - thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its 7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button that turns it into a skateboard. Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of turbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of about 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.

I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed. I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem as though it's cranking along at much more than that but I also don't know if I could tell the difference.

It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec. I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM RLL and IDE drives because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives much more than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST-01/02."

Yeah there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA XT ISA and now even MCA but at all times it was a 16 bit standard running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI ESDI whatever none of them run at CPU speed. The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much much better to get a software disk cache instead since you get write-caching as well. >because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

"1","I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation is no help at all. As an example it says 'The serial port can be changed to COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-( There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G The second bank is labeled IRQ and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the G enables the game port and the S2 SHOULD enable the second serial port but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports but I don;t know how.

I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory and I noted the following memory timings on my machine: ASQ v1.30 by Qualitas  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  Mon Apr 19 1993  11:43:49AM    page: 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCESS TIMING Hex     KB     KB   Access Speed Ratio (%) Start  Start   Size  Time us 0   25   50  75  100 00000      0     32      396 ****************** 00800     32     32      598 ***************** 01000     64     32      157 ******************** 01800     96     32      180 ******************** 02000    128     64      157 ******************** 03000    192     32      165 ******************** 03800    224    128      156 ******************** 05800    352     96      169 ******************** 07000    448     32      153 ******************** 07800    480     32      188 ******************** 08000    512     96      158 ******************** 09800    608     32      171 ******************** 0A000    640     96     1221 ************** 0B800    736     32     1581 ************ 0C000    768     32      312 ******************* 0C800    800     96      154 ******************** 0E000    896     64     3957 * 0F000    960     64      312 ******************* Note two things on this chart: 1) The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than system memory.

Here's the deal:  The thing works fine!  It low level formats etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN... (Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes. Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: Ok NDD's just not being thurough enough I'll use Spinrite I heard that works well. What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!! AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while only to return in a day or so. I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD and I really can't afford it. I'm using SMARTDRIVE and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access though I know that can create problems).

Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.

Nowhere do I see anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual: Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of 3.75 MB/s maximum 1.87MB/s minimum.  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87 sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside) Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected 'on-the-fly' in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.  (I take this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck) For page-mode operations the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching I guess you could call that a cache :-|). So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec??? Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com. > which one is better? mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same. When I ran dos I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6 this advantage is gone because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put device=pf.sys in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and such also if that is of any value to you.

"1","Hi Netters As promised here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ) so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. However it seems that at $39.95 it is quite a buy. Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance. Here is my suggestion... 1)  If you do not have any compression software currently I would go with DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS) plus the other utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides you are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...) 2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do) the cost is $29.95 for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net I decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It works great.  Not delays.  I think the A is better than B arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. I am looking forward to being able to LOADHIGH the DD sw.  That has been an annoyance. 3)  If you have Stacker et.al. currently I would not see it worth the effort to upgrade. Just my $.02 ... Regards Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was in my opinion easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly. There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such). I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper. -Bruce -- Bruce F.

Software Technical Support Engineer |               Sam Gamgee Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.   |      <My mail My Opinions> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on a 486DX 33Mhz 120MB Seagate drive running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced mode. I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files. If you have any more specific questions let me know.

(if you are familiar with Insight you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms) but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah yes one of the drawbacks of OEM!). Other questions: - Excuse my ignorance but is Texel a reputable maker in the CD-ROM market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive? - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently $449 for the TA-1000 and $699 for the TA-2000) Alternatively I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however I *do* want full multimedia capabilities Photo CD stuff educational programs for my kids etc.) and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful like a tape back-up drive unit.

"1","[] These LPT1 COM1 disk controller are call devices.  There are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership eg. disk controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership ie. it will share an interrupt with another device eg. LPT1 No.  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7 then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's because they're implemented by a single card. -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)"

Higher vertical resolution >was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have >and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8 and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested though take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file run the P9000 installation program INST and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514 as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists etc. >Interestingly the solid >vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie >filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the Bart Simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.

"1","Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it was version 1.5 build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!). One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now and I have tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said: Well Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.  Anyway I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

"1","Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems: 1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations: a) Under NDW when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an Open menu) and then is deselected a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be. b) With Word for Windows when you use shading in a table the display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example if you shade the cell as 10% the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command) and the debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed to do). The screen goes haywire and is largely unreadable. The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled. Through trial and error I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter R. This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen and it does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this. The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode. The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). --- swh 20apr93"

(Well you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies but don't count on be able to do so!)

"1","I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm hoping someone knows what this board is or even better what the various switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches 2 banks of 4 switches and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined by following traces that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3 SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4 and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number but it is blank. Immediately below the words SERIAL NO but not in the box left for the S/N are the numbers 1990 2 8. Anyone have any clues?

My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But : for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these. Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your IDE drive does not have a label then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle is center polarized that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side then you can identify pin 1 as follows: look into the pins with the notch at the top pin 1 is at the top right.  On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins 39 & 40 (the oposite end) then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1. : Secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the master drive : and which into the Slave?  any help appreciated.  thanks... It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine then you can usually get voice help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be able to help you). Good Luck Gordon Lang"

That makes real sense. Actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence. The floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr by the way) really does stink. Wally Bass"

Apparently the clock >hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The >Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then >then advances the date. > >Anybody with more info? There are two 'problems': (1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit for day increment so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the meantime and (2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date' call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to increment the date the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time) and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL) there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly though the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time because DOS is not reentrant and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.

You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor than an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA then using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-) As for graphics cards assuming that the Atari monitor can be modified/adapted to handle VGA signals you should probably be able to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't tried this but that would be my guess... Robert Anisko anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com ...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper to go that route than to do the conversion; besides with the Falcon and beyond VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go..."

The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master. In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics. There are four links LK1 LK2 LK4 and LK5 adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector. LK2: LED When fitted this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130 Ohms ot 220 Ohms. LK1: Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector indicating to the Master drive the presence of a Slave. LK4: Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way. LK5: IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per second. There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered: Master single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted. Master single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted. Master dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted. Slave dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted. Master dual drive with LED on interface		LK4 LK1 & LK2 fitted. Slave dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted. The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used. The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further details. ***************************   S E A G A T E   ************************* There is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM SCSI ESDIand IDE) on every Simtel mirror under /msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip It contains info about the following drives: st1144a	st138a	    st274a	st3283a st1057a     st1156a	st1400a     st280a	st351ax st1090a     st1162a	st1401a     st3051a	st9051a st1102a     st1186a	st1480a     st3096a	st9077a st1111a     st1201a	st157a	    st3120a	st9096a st1126a     st1239a	st2274a     st3144a	st9144a st1133a     st125a	st2383a     st325ax *********************	T E A C   ************** Model: SD-3105 Cyls.

"1","I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says the board is a 391 WB/H.  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card. Anyway that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays Parity Error -- System Halted messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to disabled or enabled in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?). I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures). I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order making sure that the connections were solid. My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card or to the motherboard (God forbid). CAN ANYONE HELP? Thanks Peace David Geller gelldav@elof.acc.iit.edu"

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a physical layer concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address it is most definetly changable.  But it is strictly software. Gordon Lang"

"1","Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade old 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a 16MHz 386 can be transformed into a 32MHz 486 with a single chip upgrade.

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5 that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS) my HD refuse to boot. Just my 2 cent. Jim"

"1","Hello I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ but couldn't find the answer. Anyway... The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is in my opinion still the best keyboard around.

Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. > > Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): > > The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape. ^^^^^^^^^^ It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200 I think) My question is: Does anybody use this product if yes how many bytes REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite unbelievable to me).

"1","I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). Well does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow!

"1","Hi everyone I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program. When I compile the program it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I can't seem to explain why it crashes. All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing. Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything?? I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup I will gladly re-post but this is the only I could find. Thanks in advance Sean Mars Email mars@carroll1.cc.edu Carroll College Waukesha WI"
"1","You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it's enabled and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory as well as the simms. The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your IDE controller also. Anyway perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better. mrb boltz@vivaldi.psu.edu mrb118@psuvm.psu.edu"

I've done some ASIC and digital design but not any CPU design. It would seem to me that on a 486 the FPU is not being used most of the cache is not being accessed the off chip buffers/drivers are idle the multiplier isn't multiplying the barrel shifters aren't shifting microcode isn't microcoding etc.  This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS) which means less heat.\ From what I understand the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power. -- Dennis Lou             || But Yossarian what if everyone thought that way? dlou@ucsd.edu          || Then I'd be crazy to think any other way!

If you ran dos you don't need a 16550 because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer.

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery. If however your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change though. It's also possible but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay get a virus scanner and check out your system."

It's also using IRQ 2) I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that explains how to sort this out but with no manual I don't know the Bboard number. If you can please help me with as many of the following as possible: a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668) c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can magicly get everything working. Any help at all would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance Red/."

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE 2 SCSI disk and 1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card but I also have a Future Domain a Western Digital SCSI card and I work with an ADAPTIC before.  As I recall all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. However to use with other controller (IDE MFM...) the boot drive has to be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE 1 SCSI). just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it. Then set up the SCSI controller (IRQ DMA etc). Set the SCSI drive to ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on.  If you have more question email me I will try to answer it. Good Luck! William"

Since installing DOS 6.0 when I tried to re-install software from 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks when I mount the second..third..fourth disks DOS 6 doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a DIR I see the contents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize that diskettes have changed is to do a label and then to not label them. Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable and worked well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro and DESQVIEW/X ( with QEMM Manifest etc) so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using.

But does anyone have a controller for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going? How about for an EISA machine?

The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems but you should still check your software! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels the connector type the pinouts and the signal protocols.  The connector is a DB-25 but IBM has set an alternative standard of DB-9.  The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD) Recieve Data (RD) and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the connection has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined but they are obsolete.  I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows: Name    DB-9     DB-25 SG       5        7 TD       3        2 RD       2        3 DTR       4       20 DSR       6        6 DCD       1        8 RTS       7        4 CTS       8        5 RI       9       22 Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE) there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert the CTS DSR DCD or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge or Lap- Link or Telix then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG TD and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio the question is do you need flow control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract escape codes but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair game.  Again you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more gotcha signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control if any can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection then I suggest you use this one.

"1","Hi: I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs! I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things: -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos) -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos) -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bits/pixel -	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of the images/data come from and is the most demanding of these tasks. I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup and decided that a nice system (price/performance) would be: 486DX-50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus 15 monitor 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise.  Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following configuration: 486DX-33 64k cache ISA 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+ 2 meg ram 14 monitor 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or been uncovered! There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish running the local window manager.  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it make a difference?  I'm hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice (above) for that reason. Also are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive controllers be they IDE or SCSI can transfer via DMA.  These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus your arguement makes no sense this isn't an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands. The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data. >>Its a long story but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which >>thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later when the device is done it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback.

(Assuming >a drive which needs formatting) Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it knows about. Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card sometimes you can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that you must use a third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor Disk Manager or the like. IDE drives come formatted already and since the is controller part of the drive mechanism itself concerns about geometry are irrelevant.

"1","In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80 you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100% if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a 20MHz 486SX then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and I will respond with a couple of sources.

I know Adaptec is good but they are kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also I have seen on the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the quantum? 2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable. Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive. 4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.

Ambiguous votes which cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is provided will be identified in the final vote tally. Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!! Rationale --------- The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library government and network usage and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not and ought not be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups. The reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics and between the two main focal points of software i.e. fulltext and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA CDI CD-R Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books copyright issues and other legal matters packaging distribution could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing in any format and is appropriate to the Internet. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as index and retrieval software premastering software cdrom simulation software hypertext sgml scanning and imaging software data capture software data clean up compression encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and video. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing as well as hardware for data capture such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom. Notes ----- These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan. Charter ------- Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.software will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: Index and retrieval software Authoring software Scanning and imaging software OCR and OCR cleanup Hypertext SGML Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.hardware will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: CD-R equipment Data capture hardware Scanners Video and audio capture hardware Networking hardware Midi hardware Photo CD hardware Publishing systems CDI and DVI hardware Compression and encryption hardware Keyboarding Other hardware publishing topics Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: Multimedia authoring software Imaging software Audio and Midi software Color control software Video editing software Audio editing software Multimedia utilities useful for publishers Integration of text image audio and video Compression and encryption of multimedia Multimedia copyright and related legal issues Multimedia databases and hypertext Other multimedia publishing topics -- Henry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu Brooklyn NY            * Disclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that of anyone else :-)  ????!"

"1","Serial cables: There are only three output signals: TD DTR and RTS. There are five inputs signals: RD DSR DCD CTS and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang"

Also the DX2/66 is faster in the operations that run off internal cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're having a GREAT Day! they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to. The details: I ordered one of their house brand Infotel 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem I would not have ordered it had I known this in advance. It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4 providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time. For several reasons I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem nothing was connected to COM2. Although the modem appeared to work during every connection at 9600 or 14.4 it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support they suggested disabling the COM2 port. This appeared to solve the disconnect problem but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a Tech Support rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured. Conclusion: I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection. For $30 more I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better..."

I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you want a real answer post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster. personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact this is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now. and now to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions post them to comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm if someone posts complete and utter bs you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds too.  there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis of course is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation LAPM) but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >The difference >with the Courier is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question: >In a previous article cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says: >>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST modem or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST period.  it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST. also not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb. >This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about HST we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme. >The Sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way >only. I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e. part of the standard).  it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual). second HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if you're logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of info back transfer files (not using bimodem) etc....  there is of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again more correctly put *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do) you're S.O.L.....  there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25 the 33 and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance with the cache enabled is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache which is around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2 compatibility but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX PGA and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available from Cyrix there.  Anyway the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16 and 386DX-20 only.  Double these clock rates and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50 then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K external cache performance were about 30% faster than the 25 but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO the DLC is a great low price upgrade for people who can't afford or can't install a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it but if you need 486DX-33 performance the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure about the DLC-40 but I think even if it matches the performance it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC people sent quite a bit of mail asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip e-mail me and I can fax or mail you more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use So I can;t post anymore info here.  However if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God you say...

Date: Wed Apr 21 19:01:49 1993 The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an idle temp - not doing lots of bus i/o not doing floating point not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This is in a Micron computer without heatsink. I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip but I might take the fan off.  It makes a horrible whine at times and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc... -- Rob Scholten scholten@epg.nist.gov End of File Press RETURN to quit Rob Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks of use mine did... As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink instead. Work just like a charm but the realy biggy to think about is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while! Sam -- Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...

I have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system. When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like you have connected to another EC modem doesn't realy say that. But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on on your modem. I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$ in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test bench.

I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill. I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=>17) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been very happy with a 16 on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic. Ok stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?

"1","==== BEGIN REPOST ==== IBM Apple Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week as Motorola Corp. IBM and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks respectively sources said. Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80 respectively. The 601 a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. The chip which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture is bus independent so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures including ISA EISA or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design one source noted. According to sources familiar with the development effort Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100 one source said. ==== END REPOST ===="

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only} some monitors and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous} SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports electronics and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode hence term 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit}. 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2. 8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2."

"1","FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax v.42 v.42bis and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression so you can get error-free links up to 57600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will fall back to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows OS/2 Unix etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom US Robotics etc).  And it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996 or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store. > I was told that it should be possible but that they had no idea how > it might be done.  Nor did they particularly care to investigate. OK here's my results so far.... 1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support Analogue video input (It works but isn't very linear...) 2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter. If you don't know how to do it don't even contemplate it.. :-) 3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode. OK having said that I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder. I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge and doesn't care about the polarity outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires. There are 2 reasons for doing this 1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're in - herc emulation is +- while MVGA is ++ for example. 2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes 3!) monitors sitting on my desk and I want to get that number down as much as possible. Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour I can get down to 1. Ultimately the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else so it'll have to wait... -- Alan Brown dogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz"

The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge have never heard of Unix and have very little interest in learning.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board.

You can get SCSI and IDE to work together but there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542): * You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives. * You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this though) and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to the SCSI BIOS but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

You might find it interesting. -- Darryl Okahata Internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com DISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day. =============================================================================== > 1)  Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE?   Will there be a noticable >     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate? For MSDOS applications ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up in some cases).  You'll also pay much much more for a good SCSI controller. Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix). Unfortunately neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage. However note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices. If you're only going to be using MSDOS stick with IDE.  It's cheaper and you'll have less headaches. > 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my >     hard-drive (bernoulli box CD-rom Tape Drive etc). [ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ] No.  Generally you have to find drivers for each SCSI device which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the better/high performance SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card or can be purchased (for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are: * Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI controllers. * CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)). This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card that has an ASPI driver like the Adaptec. Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately it works only with Adaptec controllers. > 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a >     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar >     equipment. Yes you will run into problems if you're using a high-performance bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound right doesn't it?  It's true though.  With one of these controllers you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250) and Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape backups).  If you want a copy of my Adaptec 1542 hints and tips file send email. These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC (e.g. no standards).  However adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible. SCSI holds a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1 stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say probably because while I know this to be true with a PC Unix I don't know if this really will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will but I don't know for sure.  ]"

The price is about the same but the Gateway has significantly better performance (200MB vs. 120MB hard drive 50Mhz 486DX2 vs.  25Mhz 486SL) and much cheaper accessories (extra batteries modem...) The concern I have about Gateway is the durability and reliability. Does anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad? Thanks Denis Lambert denisl@col.hp.com"

Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster >Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure >you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS obviously. Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens but a slightly simplified explanation. Technically the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer adapter SoundBlaster modem hard disk ...) to signal the CPU that Something's happening here please take note. How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. In MS-DOS the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt. Now basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When DOS prints it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there wait a while and check again.  If there's not copy a new character to the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case the SB. With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely it wastes a lot of CPU cycles.) Hence you can't share the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot. Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. When the SB plays plain music the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is needed. You can however hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt but use them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports and it can see from which port the data came from. This of course applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well. Remember this was greatly simplified in parts but I think gives the general picture correctly enough.

"1","I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday and installed it into my Gateway DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2 but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2 or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this cascade to IRQ8-15 business? A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5 6 7 are 16 bit DMAs and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question after installing PAS16 my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far).

This card is fairly fast will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768 but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS (the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17 Magnavox which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match. But...

Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A) and what I would say is a standard (not special no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? I actually have a PAS-16 and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2? Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions. Randy"

"1","I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK but is unhookable to anything standard (CGAEGAVGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise. I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card."

I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month when it is released though it'll be in limited quantities I think they have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out a bit later). Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal frequency right?) you're gonna love the 2 megs version.

It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and 800x600x16 bit at 90Hz too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate) If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL you should go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW) in the video sig.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now. SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives (ESDIRLLIDEetc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers to get it to work with odd environments.

The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a (stuff deleted) My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip. It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case so the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go. All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable. There are other board type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment. The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison: Wintach Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 Its no Viper but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee oliver@earthview"

"1","I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3 but when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC it shows up as COM3 with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)! When I get into debug and dump the data at 40:0 it shows the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem should be at COM4. Now I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4 2E8 IRQ3. To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC I have to configure the modem as COM3 2E8 IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that allows that the FAX program that came with the modem does not work. Anyway I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set as COM4... I did run a few diagnostic programs and they did not help at all: a few displayed the modem as COM4 and others displayed it as being COM3. I am not using Windows this is just a DOS problem...Any help or pointers appreciated.... For various reasons I must have this modem work at COM4 thus switching COM ports is not an answer... (Last time I posted this I did not get any DOS specific answer this time I have included all the specific information....please help!) ----- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org -- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org avinash@genesis.nred.ma.us"
"1","I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5 drives in particular the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap and have nice 3-5 year warranties. My questions are: Is there a catch? Which one is better? What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use? Is the service generally better for one of these manufacturers? Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason? thanks Michael Taylor"

On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter and it worked fine (rather he sent in the coupon for the converter). In other cases I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever else.

All tests were made on the same >computer with the same disk no cache and the same (big) files were used. Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else.  With Stacker any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. Personally I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff.  Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive. >But DOS 6 is quite good; reformat disks? I honestly don't understand WHY >you had to do this. Ditto. koberg"
"1","greetings.. I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware. My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to configure it as slave drv but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western Dig since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted It just beeped and gave me an error message about HDD controller. So I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD. any help on this matter would be much appreciated. (before I trashed my 42MB) Thankx much Handy Trisakti - uc532838@mizzou1.missouri.edu"
"1","Which would YOU choose and why? Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A) and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? Thanks for any comments. Randy"
"1","Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5 floppies? These drives are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Just a thought. Kin Chan sparrow+@cmu.edu"

"1","Hi peeps Here's another of those any ideas type queries. I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy without a keyboard.  But no problem so far. When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams? Sync? So any ideas.

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better performance though.

To put it a little differently: - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer. - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7 usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - Unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers (i.e. either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers (assert high assert low or don't assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. (Incidentally note that there's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines and that certainly isn't a requirement.) - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2 NT (?) various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons. And the SB16 alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers. Joe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)"

However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark. A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy drive plug the same cables into the floptical stick in a flopti-disk and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy. On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers I have reread a PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was quoted as saying that a 2.5 MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being productized. The article said that one of the problems holding back development in this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead to get MDs accepted. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625 inmos ltd 1000 aztec west almondsbury bristol bs12 4sq They didn't like the rates they don't like the poll tax and they won't like the council tax.   - Nicholas Ridley"

While this is true there are fixes for those who have already bought Diamond cards.  In Linux for example there are utilities that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards but at least this will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X. I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card for specialized free software avoid Diamond.  But if you already have one there may be a fix that can help you.

As far as I know there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory thereby erasing it. This will remove the password but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386 there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is something like this on your board too. In the future I would suggest that YOU set the password and leave it on Setup only. That way no-one else can go and reset it or set it to  Always unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386's for just the same reason. -Dale /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ |      DALE M.

"1","HI that might look like a dull request but I have been following this newgroup for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind. I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow. I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide; - quality of windows drivers; - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff). Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip info but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it  let me know. If this information is of any use here is my system configuration: - Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) - monitor DARIUS 14 non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) (can reach 70kHz horizontally) I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings. Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me Guy Lamouche lamouche@ere.umontreal.ca"

With the directly attached fan units I've seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage not just stop working temporarily. > I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel > to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout though. > My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu and it's located so the front fan which sucks air into the case blows right on the heat sink.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340 you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I haven磘 used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet but it might speed up twice. dieter -- Dieter Fritzsche                                      dieter@dischw.toppoint.de Maehlsweg 32 D-2300 Kiel 17 Germany                         Master of the WOM Tel   .: +49 431 362705 (Voice) FAX\BOX: +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX		 compuserve  100060654"

From what I've seen in coursework most CPUs never actually idle.  They will continue to service interrupts etc. etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

"1","Organization: Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia I have a floppy drive which has developed General failure errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5 drive). I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now. However it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk) the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector. Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it. Thanks!

"1","Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

My guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to send me some literature and will report back to the net after I've studied it.

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

I have two SCSI hard drives each has 512KB of 'cache'. There several reasons for this :- When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted. When the drive receives data to be written the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out. In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache! May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well... > > -- > > TMC > (tmc@spartan.ac.BrockU.ca) > Guy -- -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Guy Dawson - Hoskyns Group Plc. guyd@hoskyns.co.uk  Tel Hoskyns UK     -  71 251 2128 guyd@austin.ibm.com Tel IBM Austin USA - 512 838 3377"

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Simple.  First Andrew is correct although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example.  For some time I was short of free interrupts.  I had a tape controller (not a floppy tape) that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2 where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced it would most likely hang.)  Likewise when the tape backup software runs it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) -- Kenneth R. Ballou				VOICE:		 (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software Inc.

"1","Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5 hard drive model LPS240A and have a concern about its behavior. Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I/O it performs what I call phantom seeks. When the PC is absolutely idle I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card not the drive.] My other hard disk a Seagate ST3283A does not have this kind behavior.

This is a common misconception shared my many manufacturers programmers and users alike.  COM3 for example is simply the third equipped COMM port not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1 etc.  If you're playing by the rules you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of standard (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports. So what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly I don't know of a simgle program that would actually have a problem with this.) -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com"

"2","I have a 42 yr old male friend misdiagnosed as having osteopporosis for two years who recently found out that his illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up. This will eventually cause death. Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable improvement in their condition. Ceredase which is manufactured by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380000 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called the most expensive disease in the world.

They aren't designed they evolved.  And much as it discomforts us in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were by the time they reached their forties quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer Indiana and Boswell North Dakota contain quite a few gravestones like Ida wf. of Jacob Liptrap and baby May 6 1853. >You wanted >to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a >thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth. >and now you want >all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal >hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal. It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often it permanently damages one's health. Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans. >You have your kids where you want.

My aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam. We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in. And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over and I did a lot of the leg work but the main decisions were really hers. >But I for one am bothered by your continued >suggestions especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first >time that birth is dangerous even fatal and that all these >unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing >it naturally.

But for heaven's sake not everyone needs that! But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks even if fairly small of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is after all an esthetic consideration. -- Mark A.

As I understand these are all short term. I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options though depends on severity location and duration of disease as well as histology so take advice off the net for what it is worth. I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good patient but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context.

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall but significant.  Personally I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common and even a small increase in risk is significant there. -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |      ...dammit not a programmer!  = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-="

Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile. Like Prozac for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects if any are not known?  IMHO i'd say no. euclid >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   = >=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh PA             = >=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      ...dammit not a programmer!  = >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >-- >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   = >=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh PA             = >=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      ...dammit not a programmer!  = -- Euclid K.       standard disclaimers apply It is a bit ironic that we need the wave model [of light] to understand the propagation of light only through that part of the system where it leaves no trace.  --Hudson & Nelson (_University_Physics_)"

If this is what it is she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too but nowadays I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are but you get so used to it it just gets tuned out.  Yes this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience. >Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping >mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs? Millions have it according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious. The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress but I haven't changed my lifestyle much and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat but now I rarely notice it when it really kicks in). Also it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam and passed.  In fact my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should. Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it. This info is taken mostly from a few experts my own experience and some readings (sorry it was a few years back and don't have any specifics handy). JT"
"2","A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has emphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father died of the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a very occasional cigarette perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tells me this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthy life style habits good diet exercise meditation retreats therapy etc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know really nothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lining of the lung being able to exchange oxygen. Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smoking entirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are some modern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciate any information.

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain is not *always* important because some therapies are effective in both (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache. The most important thing from your perspective is that you got relief.

"2","A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme tiredness followed by: 1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows knees and hips. 2. generalized muscle pains 3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears 4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day 5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She isn't diabetic--they checked. 6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone poles do not appear to be straight) 7. loss of peripheral vision. Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg the symptoms become acute again. She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Kathy Turner"

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for life events in any recent version of Adiposity 101). The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused the weight gain in the first place.

However he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T which used to be a doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T or that Clearasil is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager nothing serious.  His father was the same so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew. The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear. Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5000 or 6000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies colds infections and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines usually) can help. Chewing gum sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies) yawning--these will help all four causes. -- Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility Edwards CA shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I don't speak for NASA A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all.

I do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with Kartagener's syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic infections. Situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong side of the body and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in absence of this laterality can be random. People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side). According to Harrison's immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of which there is probably one at NCSU. -km"

What is the mechanism and why would a physician >call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing? Purists often distinguish between true clubbing and pseudo clubbing the difference being that with true clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With pseudo clubbing the angle is initially positive then negative which is the normal situation. Real internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes. Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly only true clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization. The cause of clubbing is unclear but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally. Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often however the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent. -km"

There are many organisms viral bacterial and fungal which can cause meningitits and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause. What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the meningococcus and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases) the organism typically causes death within a day. This organism feared as it is is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis by the way. Sorry but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis is a huge topic and sci.med can't do it justice. -km"

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up. It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.

"2","I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly (motrin at the time) I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches because I've found them to be ineffective.  However I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago) so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos) but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin that doesn't work and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so I'm through with it).  In fact Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain. The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs Xrays CT scan and EMGs (I've had 2 of them and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the Xrays (and MRI I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4 and L4-L5) but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah I had some other horrible test called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine.   Anyway the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse so I'd always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago. Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources that force me to use them (Oh I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally I have to take off work but usually I can work but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad I can't concentrate much I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines an average of 3 to 4 a month which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage) but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal) but they either didn't work or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which I agree with most of the time but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine) and I've already had surgery several times. Anyway the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain. Janice Rathmann"

Very little acne as a teenager. I didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease on my face not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat). Keeping hair rinse mousse dip and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness. Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards. Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples). -Jackie-"

"2","I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south) but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience: 1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person. Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs. 2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear that these things will itch for months. 3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is required to get it. 4. Based on my experience and that of my family members the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation. 5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well. A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally applied to ankles waistband etc. is a good start.  There is another preparation called Chig Away that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.) 6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried. Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think it gains nothing). 7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery as well. Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.

Make sure to >tell the pharmacist that you want the Physicians' Package Insert *NOT* the If people are going to do this I really wish they would tell me first. I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to go ballistic but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses such as migraine and hypertension this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system we hope. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now however with a virulent resistant strain we are in more trouble and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

This condition seemed to last only a few days and I don't recall anyone reporting any other symptoms.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have been viral in nature but I don't know for sure. However I have been curious since then about this. Anyone have any ideas about what this might have been?"

Well in that case the cones are indeed >color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimed. I'm not sure who the original respondent was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen in our case reddish in certain amphibia) just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive however the two are not synonymous. So in sum and to beat a dead horse: (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_. (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rods ommatidia or other photoreceptors. (3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are processed centrally.  (The handwave is intentional) I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect color is frustrating.  But don't take my word for it.  I'm reposting a few excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color vision texts.

"2","The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING medical establishment. Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article: NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES A 3RD OPINION ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. ) DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of this list is NOT a doctor of any kind but is exercising his First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the subjects of his choice. ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store. MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food Store.  What is important is HOW they are used and what else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. ) (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes. 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including GARLIC; also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings. 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice WITH PULP followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from concentrate) apple juice then grape juice.  (Stay close to your home bathroom.) 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS CONTAIN LAETRILE.). 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled) and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey (NO sugar). Drink one glass per hour. [EVERYone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH PULP.] 6th day: Same as 5th day. 7th day: Same as 6th day. All 7 days eat ONLY the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (2) THE GRAPE DIET. Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours 8 AM to 8 PM every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the six days but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple cider flavored vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it. Do this 3 or 4 times per day for 3 weeks; then stop for a week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a FUNGUS as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.] Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in. Immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc.. Among other things the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of X-rays etc. as described in the book Born To Be Magnetic Vol. 2 by Frances Nixon 1973. PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should prepare it and drain it. For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people.  (Your greatly expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures. (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet take a 2-Billion-bacteria Acidophilus capsule which is also an EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF A.I.D.S. (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal bacteria it may also be a CURE for Lyme disease.] Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within 3 days of a full moon nor during Major or Minor Periods as listed in the Solunar Tables published bimonthly in Field & Stream Magazine (because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times). Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: For skin cancer apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the affected skin twice daily and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally for about 2 months. D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to perform NORMAL cell functions. ALMONDS (UN-blanched UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE. To help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day. To help cure cancer eat several OUNCES of almonds per day. [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally. IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is ALSO present in the digestive system.)] ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS and include Vitamin E Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most people.) Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day) Vitamin A (25000 IU per day is safe for most people.) Superoxide Dismutase (up to 4000000 Units per day) Vitamin C (up to 3000 mg. per day) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy- toluene) [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types) suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST A.I.D.S. which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia.]  (See the book Life Extension by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else. Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day. Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above. VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective and much less expensive when COMBINED together in MEGA doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100000 Maxwell) NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD especially if it is pulsating on and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion ALL types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100000-Maxwell NORTH magnetic fields. Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos of cancer tumors etc. with-OUT X-rays! INTERFERON tablets. TAHEEBO TEA (Lapacho). HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer and many other medical problems (even drug addiction!). 50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure prostate trouble. This list is NOT exhaustive. The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN- DIAGNOSED cancers as well as PREVENT them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work effectively. Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet send a strong message to one's subconscious mind PROGRAMMING it to CURE the cancer. In my opinion if a person finds out that s/he has cancer then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast) BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations and agonies [POISON BURN and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Well making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me. I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a second opinion and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact HEADING that support group) was helpful for a while but after a point I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself. A recent movie Lorenzo's Oil offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm or a weak heart or failing kidneys I might not have the same opinion.  That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments.  With dizziness you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it. I have chosen the latter.

If you can't ftp send me mail and I'll uuencode and mail them to you (they're pretty big...) ============== Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues Mini outline: 1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 2. X terminals 3. NeXT 4. Silicon Graphics 5. IBM RS/6000 6. Other stuff 1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard (Sun HP DEC etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation runs the X window system you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used PC hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable to your workstation.  Then run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events. The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X. a2x is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server extension (XTEST DEC-XTRAP or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your server can do this run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this you may want to investigate compiling X11R5 patchlevel 18 or later or bugging your vendor. kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended X servers. Another program called xsendevent also exists but I haven't seen it. Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu. 2. X terminals Also a number of X terminals (NCD Tektronics to name a few) use PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal you may be all set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also some X terminals add extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key. 3. NeXT NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop Bus meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then they announced they were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of upgrade for an older NeXT do it now! 4. Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards except by upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more details. 5. IBM RS/6000 IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  || Unfortunately you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  || cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   || smaller PS/2 style DIN-6 and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe || it or not IBM wrote this device driver recently I used it and it || works.  However they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  || told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn || anything new please send me e-mail.				    || 6. Other stuff Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp) support some odd keyboard types and may be responsive to your queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either from the vendor or with a storage oscilloscope) you may be in luck.  Contact the companies for more details. Apple Adjustable Keyboard Apple Computer Inc. Sales offices all over the place. Availability: February 1993 Price: $219 Supports: Mac only Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The keyboard has one section for each hand and the sections rotate backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion. The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard. A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions. The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests which are not directly attachable to the keyboard. As soon as soda comes back up I'll have a detailed blurb from TidBITS available there. FlexPro Keyboard Key Tronic Phone: 800-262-6006 Possible contact: Denise Razzeto 509-927-5299 Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops Availability: Spring 1993 (?) Price: $489 (?) Supports: PC only (highly likely) Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section. The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard. Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards also so this product will probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.

The program is called a2x and is available via anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current) If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows you may want to ask for Peter Cohen an salesman at Dragon who knows more about this sort of thing. Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products. Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number of popular word processors and spreadsheets. Each user `trains' the system to their voice and there are provisions to correct the system when it makes mistakes on the fly.  Multiple people can use it but you have to load a different personality file for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard too. On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute. I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000. The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30000 words at a time. The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

Big backlog -- could take 3+ months. Price: $2000/unit (1 unit == 2 pods). (new price!)			    || Each hand has its own pod.  Each of the four main fingers has five switches each: forward back left right and down.  The thumbs have a number of switches.  Despite appearances the key layout resembles QWERTY and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod tilts in its base to act as a mouse.

You purchase compatibility modules a new cord and possibly new keycaps and then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines. It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the standard 101-key keyboard except sliced into three sections.  Each section is on a custom telescoping universal mount.  Each section independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three sections too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections flat and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

"2","Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/software Version: 1.8 7th December 1992 This FAQ is actually maintained by Richard Donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk>. I post it along with the other FAQ stuff.  If you have questions you want to send mail to Richard not me.  -- Dan Software Tools to help with RSI ------------------------------- This file describes tools primarily software to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches... Please let me know if you know any other tools or if you have information or opinions on these ones and I will update this FAQ. I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them. Richard Donkin Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853 Changes in this version: Added information on StressFree another typing management tool for Windows. TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages. Often RSI appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is getting RSI. Tool: At Your Service (commercial software) Available from: Bright Star Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697 Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4) Windows Description: Provides calendar keyboard watch email watch and system info. Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations on posture and exercises.  Sound-oriented will probably work best with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible to record your own messages to warn of break. Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software) Available from: Media Vision Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563 Platforms: PC Description: A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port. Includes 'At Your Service'. Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software) Available from: Escape Ergonomics Inc 1111 W. El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale CA Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410 Platforms: DOS Description: Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier. It gives you 3 exercises to do each time randomly selected from a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do - data entry word processing information processing. Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does. CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer. A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included. CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows but does not then warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows. Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts site licenses. Comments: The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools. Tool: EyerCise (commercial software) Available from: RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr. Haverhill MA  01830 US Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only) Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS] Description: Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics. Quote from their literature: EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work all parts of your body relieving tension and helping to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these help you to become more relaxed and productive. The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C. Godnig O.D. and John S. Hacunda which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use. Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling quantity discounts for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US). Comments: I have a copy of this and it works as advertised: I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC and has one window without window controls.  Very usable though and does not require any sound hardware. Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software) Available from: Visionary Software P.O. Box 69447 Portland OR  97201 US Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200 Platforms: Mac DOS (Windows version underway) Description: Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises to do during breaks and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59; quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is bought in from another company apparently; not sure how equivalent this is to the Mac version. The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful 2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions with references. Tool: StressFree (commercial software free usable demo) Available from: LifeTime Software P.O. Box 87522 Houston Texas 77287-7522 US Tel: 800-947-2178 (US only) Fax: +1 (713) 474-2067 Mail: 70412.727@compuserve.com Demo (working program but reduced functions) available from: Compuserve: Windows Advanced Forum New Uploads section or Health and Fitness Forum Issues At Work section. Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites) Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway) Description: Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate.  Quite a few exercises can configure which ones are included to some extent.  Online help. Version 2.0 is out soon Mac and DOS versions will be based on this. Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet otherwise $39.95. Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0). Comments: I have had a play with this and it works OK.  Its user interface design is much better in 2.0 though still a bit unusual. expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards FTP servers and Bitnet servers! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises. Tool: Typewatch (freeware) version 3.8 (October 1992) Available from: Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO SunOS Mach; character and X Window mode) Description: This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing.  It does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again. Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out. The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode) in a pop-up window (for X Windows) or as a Zephyr message (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for X Zephyr and Mach. Not formally supported but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk (for SCO SunOS character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach X Window mode Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give feedback. Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs Available from: Various sources Platforms: Various Description: Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool. Or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen. Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file and include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes starting from 9 am. Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment enter 9:30 hit Enter and type some text in saying what the break is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment. By using Windows Recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this file on your 'run=' line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises. The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will depend a lot on your operating system. While these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best. Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers Available from: Various sources e.g. Casio BP-100. Description: Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically. While these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing. Comments: My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day. I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. One-handed typing tools may help but be VERY careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse. Tool: hsh (public domain) Available from: Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones) Description: Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. Only works through tty's (so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most X programs). Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various) Available from: Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c Also built into Windows 3.x. Description: The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent RSI a bit but you can also use it if you have RSI since it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-) -- Dan Wallach               One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet. -- CM Paris Ref.

As usual you are missing the whole point Russell because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes. This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping. If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was for that matter the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur? In an earlier article Russell Turpin writes: >None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should >open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science. >Modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditional >Chinese medicine receive little respect because for the most >part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research >Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.) First of all I think you are arguing against a straw man because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo-science homeopathy chiropracty and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I in particular think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky. What some of us do believe however is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention. If in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology by current standards was seriously flawed. It is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly. But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR. The remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide. First a glossary (or fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :) RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below) Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint. Pronation: Turning the palm down. Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up. Supination: Turning the palm up. Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down. Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil. Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger. Power grip: The grip used for a hammer. Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb. Abduction: Moving away from the body. Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide. Now then problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they're not necessarily the problem. --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory. Normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power you're completely restricting your blood flow. Without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid which cause pain. Once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues. Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too. Anyway when you're typing too much you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse. --- Specific injuries you may have heard of: (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.) Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you've got your problem. Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain.  Sub-acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition. Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension' this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy). Others: for just about every part of your body there's a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery). ==4== Typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really do it every three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax. If you can't sleep you really need to focus on this.  Rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal. There are all kinds of other treatments of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best for you. --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach] . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes get up and bend your spine backward. Set the seat height first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much. Now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest. Now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area. If you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available. [Now I diverge a little from the text] A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area I highly recommend Just Chairs.  The name says it all. --- Keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements: There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However with good posture you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be right there.  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit how you type and how you relax.  It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands. Some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available on the market today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail. ==5== Requests for more info Clearly the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like to submit something please send me mail and I'll gladly throw it in. If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors that would be wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd love somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the above sections looking for places where I've obviously goofed. ==6== References I completely rewrote the information section here using a wonderful guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service a service of their Department of Labour.

This indicates confusion between proof and the process >of doing science. You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make. I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result. As an end result of science one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science. If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses. Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING. Without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology. It depends on the quality of their THINKING. It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses. And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

There's a pretty good article in the the March 6 1993 New Scientist titled Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil.  The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.

"2","I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG MRI EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again. Well we were going along fine and the other morning April 5 she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think Oh oh this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.  Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure. When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure. Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway as you can guess I am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.

Creegan) writes: > >What about Kekule's infamous derivation of the idea of benzene rings >from a daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails?  Is this >specific enough to count?  Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic >phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of >hypothesizing. And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root- Bernstein.  See his book Discovering.  Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule' after him and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more. I don't think extra-scientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction. For example Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich) looking at the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid. Again Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the Newton of mirror-image life which he never admitted publically. Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro which the student eventually did whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which in 15 or so years produced the famous discovery (Avery MacLeod and McCarty JEM 1944). -- Mark A.

Well let me put it this way based on my own experience.  A general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases by establishing links to the Lyme community treating patients who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they have lyme as if they did saying that diseases such as MS are probably spirochetal if not Lyme giving talks at meetings of users groups validating the feelings of even delusional patients etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill $100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his office and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out by support groups etc.  This is a definite temptation. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"2","Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council. New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak To: National Desk Environment Writer Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver 202-783-7800 both of the Natural Resources Defense Council WASHINGTON April 14  -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee. The EPA list is attached. These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration said Erik Olson a senior attorney with NRDC.  Water contamination isn't just a problem in Bangladesh it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston. As of June 29 1993 about 100 large surface water systems on EPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution Olson continued.  Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law's deadline. Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia. Adding to the level of concern a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems. This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public Olson noted.  The time has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink. NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.

"2","We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (I'm the one who can't fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway turning the thread around the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I got overheated and dehydrated.  Afterwards I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later I could feel a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night the pain subsided. This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise. I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?). I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into shape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this?

Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.  Unfortunately >I'm not one of them. > > This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears to be totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight. When I get too fat I just diet/exercise more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range but smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid that this method will stop working someday but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting (that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle- dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change. I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.

OK just for grins: - Kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail. - Archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in his bath.

Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule.  Surely there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a non-rational process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it? Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning extra-scientific? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model? -- Gary H.

Simply avoiding > mistakes doesn't get you anywhere. I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes. Above Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not. Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this. Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work while technically correct is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. > If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit > to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information. > But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This > is where you and I disagree with Turpin. I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi. > ... In order to have science one must have a theoretical > structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically > validated random hypotheses. Certainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. Russell"

I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered lots of stuff I had never seen before.

Such extra- >rational cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology. As has been noted before there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed and reasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logic. But people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science. There are a couple of negative points to make here: 1) A theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi.  For example quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other. (I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi though. I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.) 2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out and interpreted in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which computations get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated. The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properly. Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable and important result. This is where Lysenko creationists etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their theories do predict and are contradicted by experiment they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists). -- Mark A.

"2","Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house. In science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty. If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made.

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science. Taken to the extreme I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science. For one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile. Furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance. For instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors.) I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

Hi Janet Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance same onset symptoms same cafergot uselessness same duration.  In fact of all the people I know who have migraines none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine but since ours seem to be alike here are my observations. I don't think it's heat per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after. Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much either. I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in descending order of importance): 1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting		(e.g. skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma	(e.g. head bonk) Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines but I don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered this I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two or three years when I get cocky (It's been so long maybe I just don't get them anymore) and stop being careful. Hope this is helpful. John."

"2","A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not. Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months. As a result of the pain my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it. The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis. My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words not mine). If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis alternative courses of action support groups or literature on it I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.

"2","I love the FAQ. The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well? Also why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of only about 5% of the corneal depth while RK is done to a depth of up to 95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not be understanding all of the differences. In the FAQ the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It is important to know if that is not the case however and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense which glasses couldn't help. would not help. -- | Daniel R.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of progress and rationality in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past I won't go into them again now. What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the correct) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an anything goes view.) True the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science. -- Gary H.

INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese are ten week ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week five hours per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact Steven Brener Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below. ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## ####################################################################### JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States.  It is also designed to let scientists engineers and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts. PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly JSTMP consists of three major components: 1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time. 2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology Sociology History and Political Science.  Moreover seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled. 3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however shorter ones are possible. FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of. For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W. Olney a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive and that its major constituent glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res 1988 and check *his* sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute. --Dianne Murray    wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca"

Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common.  The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers. (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved 400 or so bp sequence that occurs about 500000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.) >It further at least implicitly advances the position that >sciences goes forward (and it is not clear what this means given the >context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational >and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then >weeded out via the critical function of science. I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong you will find out soon enough; but at least you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at all in mind you will probably get nowhere. >(Though why this critical >function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. Unfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene cold fusion and so forth. >If experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are >subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true >of the application of any critical function concerning replication. >This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an anything goes view.) I don't agree that this follows.  In fact this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work out. Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_ not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc. 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom runny nose what the hell it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact he found lysozyme. >True the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is >*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have >resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply >do not generalize well to the actual history of science. It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole. -- Mark A.

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea up to 8 I think and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK it vaporizes. In RK the eye is cut into. >In the FAQ the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than >with glasses alone.

We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me but I don't. This isn't scientific or proof but this would lead me to believe it's not a different reaction just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes some people can get by with just monitoring their diet others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly. I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.

Look people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant. I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt. What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing: ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition not science'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.'' And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not. Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high that some blame it for anything and everything. My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue although I am probably 20-1 outnumbered. Jason Chen"

"2","I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness as well as my general health. I did exactly as he asked and made the call (reaching his secretary). I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective. The doctor called me back and his first words were Whatever you want you'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit- chat with you!  I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him and that I was feeling worse.  I then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time.  He responded Just spit it out now because no time is a good time.  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said well never mind and he said he'll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time. This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express myself well he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told me that he just doesn't have time to rap with patients and thought that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to rap was insulting and said again that I was just following through on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me this apology: I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain and I don't have a lot of time to deal with that.  He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication. I am still upset and have not yet called. My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care? (2) Since I am in pain off and on I realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive? If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain I have he still wants me to status him on my condition but now I am afraid to call him. --Marlena"

Well I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also extra-scientific etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc. The same may be said about logical grounds.  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) surprising? Well given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of perfectly rational grounds?  Well there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it new?  Well one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like. -- Gary H.

In normal condition the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons. Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement it is alsoinvolved in develpoment memory and learn (it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning)."

There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate. >and that its major constituent glutamate >is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain >(humans included). I don't know about premier but it's certainly an important one. >Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown off. Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely. >Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in >small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts >added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be >encountered in a ny single food. Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG? >By eating lots of junk food >packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your >blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these >compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.

"2","-*---- I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in this thread.  In case this puzzles people I would like to expand on two of her comments. In article <C5JoDH.9IG@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes: > Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also > widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. > ... In the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all > the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave > the house. One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context scope and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research some leave a hole that needs to be filled in and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these. Past snippets from this thread: >>> I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  .... >> He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would >> distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from >> one in which it does not. ... Back to Lee Lady: > These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and > sci.psychology.  According to these posters  If it's not supported by > carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science. These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A carefully designed and controlled study is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a carefully designed and controlled study to alleviate our skepticism.) Rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.) Russell"

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising. That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life but the dreams are right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years) ready for anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim). Of course Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment but turns out to be right in the end. Mark -- Mark A.

"2","INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese are ten week ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week five hours per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact Steven Brener Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below. ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## ####################################################################### JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States.  It is also designed to let scientists engineers and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts. PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly JSTMP consists of three major components: 1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time. 2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology Sociology History and Political Science.  Moreover seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled. 3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however shorter ones are possible. FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

He had a seizure the next day.  She sees sensitivity to nutrasweet sugar colors caffine and corn.  With corn she says he gets very nervous and aggresive. With my own daughter (age 7)  I think she is also sensitive and stays away from those foods on her own.

"2","[From Kalat J.W.. (1992):  _Biological Psychology_. Wadsworth Publishing Co. Belmont CA.  Pg. 219.  Reproduced without permission.] Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors Although the _miracle berry_ a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein _miraculin_ that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk Gentile Moskowitz & Meiselman 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it) for about the next half an hour all acids (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well. Miraculin was for a time commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories. A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice sauerkraut juice even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

"2","I posted this to sci.psychology on April 3 and after seeing your post here on panice disorder thought it would be relevant. ----- My research indicates that two schools of thought exist. the literature promoting medication says it's the superior treatment.  Not surprisingly literature promoting cognitive therapy also claims to be superior. What are the facts?  Early in my research I didn't have a bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I was interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading journals published after 1986 the cognitive therapy camp claims a higher success rate (approx 80%) a lower drop-out rate and no side effects associated with medication. Lars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and a review of controlled studies.  This is from Behav. Res. Ther. vol. 25 no. 5 pp. 397-409 1987.  The article provides instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (AR).

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis. Of course cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas among many other problems as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and in men gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant. Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected at least statistically in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you and offer you support. Simon."

Given how common they are eaten - do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff? - I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now. Also there's nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brain is concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as galactosemia) sugar is sugar regardless if it is coated on cereal sprinkled onto cereal or dissolved in soda coffee or whatever.

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old Newtonian model of the world.  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical world view.  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. >It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be >reasonable but so are many non-scientific methodologies. Aristotle reasoned >that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. Oversimplified of course but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested though perhaps not by Aristotle and eventually found wanting.  In the meantime some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life. There's nothing at all surprising about this it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base even idiotic to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories. Again I think it gets down to defining what you mean by science.  I often don't recognize what it is that I do and am involved in in the way science is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They portray science as a collection of immutable facts pronouncements of TRUTH in big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab turn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula- tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human process."

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO) in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence regions are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats which are less sensitive to Glu than humans have been observed: after ingesting Glu on a chronic basis cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened. Hope this helps. --Dianne Murray: wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca"
"2","A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information. A few weeks ago she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way she is 29 or 30 years old). It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.

This is a lovely area for anecdotes but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician I almost never get sick: usually when something horrendous is going around I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case. When I do get really sick it is always something unusual. This was not the situation when I was in medical school particularly on pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam! I think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantly exposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that later on when challenged with something it is more likely a re-exposure for us so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also don't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home and we carry a lot of that around. -km"

Not to drag this out anymore but.... Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness swollen joints +/- fever. A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove that the disease exists. This paper is noteworthy in two other regards: 1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans. 2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy. Anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so. -- Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu> also:   jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet    AOL: JeffParke Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994 Pullman WA  99164-7012"

I attribute my success to several factors: Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me I only eat fruit vegetables and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat. Very little sugar or salt. Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.) My clean your plate conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time and gives satiety a chance to catch up so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else. I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly and eating won't be practical then). I bike to work 22 miles a day year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores movies and everywhere else as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family) and increase my metabolism.  (Even so my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F) and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.) There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health. Obviously I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed. > I think all of us cycle.

One problem is that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the sample is drawn reducing the apparent level.

As stated above whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect whole blood levels however.

"2","Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it. Phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them it will accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells.  Therefore it is Only a major problem in young children (until around age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child or when pregnant. -heather"

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window or dreaming or having a fantasy  or watching an apple fall (Newton) or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first. Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the key elements in developing it. Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks for instance of Darwin's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution. This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.

By your logic I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys are but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.

"2","This will be the first of monthly postings of the newsletter of the Long Island Chapter of the Transplant Recipients International Organization (TRIO).  Unfortunately I was unable to post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'm posting it anyway and posting it world-wide instead of regional in the hopes that some of the information may be useful or illustrative.  Also I hope it can be used as an example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation. Mike Transplant Recipients International Organization Long Island Chapter P.O. Box 922 Huntington NY 11743-0922		 NEWSLETTER 516/421-3258 APRIL 1993 VOLUME IV   No. 8 NEXT MEETING The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights of Columbus Emerald Manor 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale. Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is a long time friend of TRIO surgeon to many of our members and always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a very informative interesting and engaging evening.  Our hospitality committee  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence will be well prepared and at last the weather should be cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome Dr. Teperman. WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE LAST MEETING It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance. No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the Long Island Railroad making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation.  Our scheduled speaker Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications.  However  Ms. Jennifer Friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening. ANNUAL MEETING In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman the April meeting is also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the Board. Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient) Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient) Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient) David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP) Those remaining on the Board for another year are: Robert Carroll (Liver Kidney & Pancreas Recipient) Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient) Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient) Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient) This may seem to be a big Board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board members and there is plenty of work. In addition  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up. We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with Dr. Teperman. FUTURE MEETINGS Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year. May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio Chief of Psychiatry Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport Director of the Stony Brook Kidney Transplant Program. Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month. NOTDAW The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and Gaffney we have decided not to have our softball game because of two year's experience with miserable weather. We all can help spread the word on donor awareness however. We have found it effective to ask your pastor or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin allow you to address the congregation or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you. DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl  call Anne Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details. MEMBERSHIP NEWS Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing well after only 12 days in hospital. Arthur Michaels liver recipient is planning to run the Boston Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation works!  We hope the national press notices. Bob McCormack after a persistent bout with infection had his transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now back on dialysis and feeling better. Nicole Healy kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida. They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. Kay Grenzig liver recipient is mending now after a bad fall that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a candidate for the Board so we need her well soon. And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough winter for many but the tulips are just under the snow. SEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE DR. LEWIS TEPERMAN"

All I can say is that I will not consume it. Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde it is actually relatively non-toxic. -- Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {imaharvardrayssdlinusm2c}!spdcc!dyer"

Rutin is a bioflavonoid compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular especially in Europe to treat capillary fragility and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago a friend was visiting from Italy and he said that he'd had hemorrhoids but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.

(To >reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from >uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical >problems are notoriously problematic.) Okay so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all there are degrees of certainty.  It might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain treatment. On the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing. SECONDLY it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation. Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us. To me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme There've got to be controlled studies position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure. Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or in the case of PTSD once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home. Now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. (Especially if as NLPers claim the success rate is extremely high.) Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term follow-up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different NLP technique before I learned of the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.) The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance.) The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying We don't have any way of knowing that it's effective. These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say  Why should I prove your theory?  and  The burden of proof is on the one making the claim. One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much detail as I'm capable of.) Actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with favorable results) but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal. To me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it. This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science. Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you Russell.

"2","This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before. He took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges. In the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do) the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea and a few cloves. On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes. Later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are: 1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from? 2)  About 5 or 10 years ago I remember hearing that carmel color (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something.  If the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the U.S. yet it is still being used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what? 3)  About 5 or 10 years ago I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic Earl Grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so. WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now as it happens) I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips. My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct? I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals. And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don't know about the others. An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal when it was discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils. This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic. The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal- broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!"

E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute things the more powerful they get even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.

If you get into the Qi accupuntunce charts etc you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.

What follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet. [Reproduced without permission] The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England where a group of researchers found that aspartame marketed under the tradename Nutrasweet appears to stimulate appetite and presumably the eating of more calories in the long run than if a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group of 95 people to drink plain water aspartame-sweetened water and sugared water they said that overall they felt hungriest after drinking the artificially sweetened beverage. The study received widespread media attention and stirred a good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. However its results were questionable at best since the researchers did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not necessarily go hand in hand. In the years that followed more than a dozen studies examining the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. And after reviewing every one of them the director of the Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins University Barbara Rolls Ph.D. concluded that consuming aspartame- sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in the amount of food eaten afterward. One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981 the government has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. Still years of careful scientific study conducted both before and after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with monitoring public health) the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs and the Food and Drug Administration have given aspartame one of the most studied food additives a clean bill of health. Granted the FDA has set forth an acceptable daily intake of 50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed the limit however a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take in 2750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of aspartame-sweetened soda pop 14 cups of gelatin 22 cups of yogurt or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa... A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4000 milligrams of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content of selected foods omitted] Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12000 to 15000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child consumes it it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with PKU avoid the substance labels on cans of soda pop and other aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine. -Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

"2","KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart) KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information I'm not sure that this condition is recognised anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria clear boundaries between it and other diseases unique pathologic or physiologic features etc) but here goes with what many neurologists agree on. Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination EMG and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously little or no group atrophy. Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio. The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen. There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells motor axons neuromuscular junctions and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these acute changes in a chronic disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years. There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests. My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles tendons ligaments bones and joints that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e. those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints). --- . SLMR 2.1 .

One theory is that the remaining motor DN> neurons have to work harder and so die sooner. If this theory were true the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy (evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units); it doesn't. Instead the biopsy shows scattered angulated atrophic fibers. This is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked motor neurons - the neurons survive at the expense of increasingly denervated muscle. --- . SLMR 2.1 .

We will ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding no hybrids etc.  The ethical question is should ;we? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1) reducing the gene pool and 2) defining the status of the eugenized. Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out garbage genes. This may in the future become possible. Even if it does awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism nuclear winter ice age meteor impact new microbiological threats famine global warming etc. etc. are all conceivable. Therefore having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival. Of course the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make philosopher-kings with great bodies and long lives would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a while it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before 1984. I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others and have survived by making better choices when their turns came. Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that too. The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We as eugenists may make it an we may not. If we don't I hope there are reservoirs of garbage people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which will pull us through. I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have and I believe all men may listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far or else haven't had enough power for long enough. In summary I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer in some ways hard in some ways easy is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power it is the Spirit. Sorry for the long post. Got carried away. Bob (ruegg@med.unc.edu)"

It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.) To start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  You people call THIS science?   (My opinion for what it's worth is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.) Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science. My second point though is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific. Within mathematics I think there are several examples especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later mathematicians did prove them of course.) I think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.) When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation. In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: > Namely is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches? Admittedly my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer. The science I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century. I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observation. One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies. Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

"2","As promised below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with the results.  The catalog description is as follows: The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two counter-rotating thumbs that move in one-inch orbits -- releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms. Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109 To order or receive a catalog call (24 hours 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021. ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was $179 not $109.  When I received it I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days) he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives then return the old one.  VERY reasonable people. ******** I have long-term neck shoulder and back pain (if I were a building I would be described as structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away. If for whatever reason I do not exercise for a while (illness not enough time lazy etc.) the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t. The tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub-occipital muscles in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull) the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged. I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage NOT VIBRATE my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary. I have been using it for about a week or so now and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14 x 9 rectangle about 3-3/4 high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal thumbs are about 1-1/2 in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2 above the base.  The thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more toward one end rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it. _______________________________ |  __    _______________    __  | | |  |  |		|  |  | | | |  |  |  \^^/   \^^/  |  |  | | | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | | | |  |  |		|  |  | | | |  |  |_______________|  |  | | | |__|			   |__| | |_______________________________| For the neck/head the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time) and I don't have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me. For my back I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place. If I want to massage the entire spine I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it.  For my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home-made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together (with the balls position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple considerations/hassles I'm more likely to not bother with it. Not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles however I overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice which helped. After that I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged. I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me. It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out. I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy) since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely  for me. This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog or Mature Wisdom. I'm only 37 but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits. I apologize for the length of this but it's the kind of info _I_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

"2","Following a series of miscarriages my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a foreign body. Where this blocking is deficient the body evicts the intruder resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk. We're now thinking about having another child but no one (including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies. Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this? Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake) P.S. I've also posted this in misc.kids."

I first experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely. Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands.

"2","My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her.  However I discovered that she is actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years. My dictionary says that osteopathy is a medical therapy that emphasizes manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought to cause disease and inhibit recovery. Jeez this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O. and don't remember any manipulative techniques.  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the real practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also I'm interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who follows one or the other medical philosophy.

What would this effect be called?  Have these effects > ever been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you in > advance for all replies. These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are blind in various ways.  Some of these are: o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a placebo or the test treatment i.e. whether they are in the control group or the test group. o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment. o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment. Obviously at the point at which the data is analyzed one has to differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it. It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals such as mice there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not blind themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are though it is important that in all respects except the one tested the control and test groups are treated alike.

I don't think it is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food. She has always been very calm and dare I say a neat smart kid. The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our immediate family Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever running nose itchy eyes etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history including some weird food allergies - nuts mushrooms.

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.

The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a plug and patch. The doctor considered the procedure a success. A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair. Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.

"2","-*---- I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work.  Lee Lady writes: > I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some > of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely > thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as > scientific work. Unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific.

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about.  Consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc.  In short knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are mainly about. The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition. > Okay so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all there are degrees > of certainty.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls. As to the first I do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth.  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence. One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds. This is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation's Rhine. > One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't > been described in a scientific journal. ...

I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.) Finally I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little about either and so have nothing to offer. Russell"

We're talking prudent policy in >infant nutrition here yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom. Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary ANH and ME of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology. I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You) and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of Glu and Asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly) and their hidden presence in HVP necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. >>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you >>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles >>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. > >You mean asserting.

It says nothing about the frequent >inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab. Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches?

"2","As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD? I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was. She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way she believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict. (Eat all the chips chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right then the moral and ethical standards of the food chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ? This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference but some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions for the net are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in pet food? ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola ----------------------------------- -- Walter Lundby"

No there is something called the Delany Amendment which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the 1950's before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude. This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the Act they are banned. This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves. If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone would do it in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect. An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file'. This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural form so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats."

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.] ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the 1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate' their subjects they photographed them.  They found that if an object was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in highly variable colour patterns. High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and others have been produced in Brazil Austria and Germany. Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing someone.  Normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase. But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see' the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object itself. [...] Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...

If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact Kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O. Pehek Harry J. Kyler and David L. Faust who reported their findings in the October 15 1976 issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious auras or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.

(It IS too hot for me and I don't say that very often.)  And she could bring ice cream with crushed dried chiltepins for dessert. And we could see if there IS such a thing as an unrealistically large quantity of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the summer and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.

"2","Frequently of late I have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel puffy like I have a cold and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy. The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese) the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain a japanese steak house (I had the steak) and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice. I am under the impression that MSG enhances flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell. Also as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG this is what I suspect as being the cause. I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny. Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the tobacco companies still deny). - DM (If I sound grumpy it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch today and now it hurts to swallow) -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dan Myers (Madman)		| If the creator had intended us to walk myers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu	| upright he wouldn't have given us knuckles ------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

"2","We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on Nassau Street Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation a nonprofit foundation established to encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us. On Saturday April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton a local family will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis. Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx vocal cords and trachea.  Caused by a virus the tumors grow block the air passages and would lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths. Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her lifetime. Even though the disease is hardly a household word it has affected the lives of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a newsletter enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level and aid in the prevention cure and treatment. Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available for research.  Because RRP is rare it not only gets scant attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP Foundation's mission is to change that. Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale please call Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the Foundation's booth during Communiversity April 24th 12 to 4 p.m. in downtown Princeton or sent directly to: The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation 50 Wesleyan Drive Hamilton Sq. NJ  08690. Thanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu"
"2","It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers. This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world? As a parting note wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for future sufferers.) gervais"

By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. Whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previous operation I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination. Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far too expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger. ==================================== Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu"

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e. those who can't hit fast pitch or are not used to hitting off a machine)  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was better - but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe her.)

Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope. Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes.

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression. Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger) or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities. The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind rather than being from an external source. Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety. In OCD the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual take an hour or more per day and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships. Treatments include psychotherapy behavioral methods and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions. The standard diagnostic code for OCD if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 . kind regards todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Todd I.

As I understood it MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in tomatoes? Anyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural things; peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc.  Just because something is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks. As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer. People have long modified the taste of food by additives whether they be chiles black pepper salt cream sauces etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them? How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner? Julie DISCLAIMER:  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else"

"2","The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to: 1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with it or actually having this disorder ) and 2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internet. Recently I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals procedures...etc. I don't want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI EKG cat-scans are all normal but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests body structure tests and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where we stand right now.... If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing from you. I am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gather information about it. As I know now these particular types of disorders are still not really well understood by the medical community and so I'm going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle insight.

There >is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness. > >There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists. There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used. For example Dr. Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course this is only the beginning for his program. In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly written book):  e.g. extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well. Of course I have allergy symptoms etc.  I am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course the $60000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc.) can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons. BTW some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time. In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee their safety.  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned. Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

"2","My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  When the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was) On her next visit my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT! My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound. Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so where would we find such an expert in Chicago?)  We don't really have any special medical reason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob-gyn can't then I don't see why we shouldn't use one.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida a yeast infection. For the year-long study researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park New York recruited 13 women who suffered from chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second 6 months the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt. The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm. It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a protective effect against Candida albicans however. Women who want to try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists acidophilus in its contents. --- end --- =================================== InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

"2","Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago and I have just got hold of a book How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation by Margaret D. Corbett ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method) published in 1953.  It talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball? Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process i.e. shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's idea right?)

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term. My questions are: Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain? Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced? Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored? Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated. Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group. If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated. -- Gregory W.

Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess by a trained person but it's still no more than a guess. It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don't respond. There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn't have all the answers. This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a miracle cure maybe it's valid.

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some >claim their heart skipped beats once in a while. Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium but like everything else one can get too much of a good thing. >Some reacted with headache Again this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her necessarily. >some stomach ache. Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long) and lacks an enzyme to break it down gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected. > Some had watery eyes or running nose These are respiratory reactions and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive synergystic subtractive etc etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place the vertebrate body. > some >had itchy skin or rashes. People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that pisses off their body. Pollen for example of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people because when inhaled it sets of the immune system and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile linden etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. >More serious accusations include respiration >difficulty See above. And don't think that heart rate changes and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly. and brain damage. The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol as well as somatostatin and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be uh a wee bit unethical. >Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one >suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating  say undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic) plus too much alcohol and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home plus let's say having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things. But it might be the MSG. >if you heard things about MSG you may think it must be it. If noone else got sick its likely not food poisoning.

I'm thinking that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for sale but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly appreciated. In case you don't know Krillean Photography to the best of my knowledge involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed and depending on what type of object it is the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature. There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals) published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe what is needed and how to set up the apparatus. These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the energy signature of organic objects. I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school. I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by first dunking them in water.

"2","I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available. I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests. In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer heart disease should be offered free to the American public. This could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure.

"2","I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold turned pale and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of the day. My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold. Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.  I'm 34 vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms (I hope)? Has this happened to anyone else?

"2","Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor? Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at 5:50 pm.  The clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed here.  During the next few minutes in response to my questions with several trips to the back room the receptionist told me: - the doctor was doing paperwork in the back - the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going to the emergency room; - the doctor would not even speak to me; - she would not tell me the doctor's name or her own name; - when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said I don't know. I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mary Ryan				mryan@stsci.edu Space Telescope Science Institute Baltimore Maryland"
"2","FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to what the group is for...... A note to the users of alt.psychoactives.... This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics Prozac Lithiumetc) antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?) etc) OCD drugs(Anafranil etc) and so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to sci.med where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data. It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of the above mentioned. Oh well I had unsubscribed to this group for some time and I decided to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for. I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it being moderated...too bad. Oh well obviously no one really cares.

"2","I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently published results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrome patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may have a psychological trigger or basis.  What I heard about this study was that in one 'personality' a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used according to what I heard) while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms including testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.

"2","someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture needles..... Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS from acupuncture needles. Generally even if accidently inoculated the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion. Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise disposable needlesused here. These needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles. If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments. The risk here for hepatitis HIV etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk. Better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them. Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would  be in a typical shot. when the skin is puntured. On the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site. While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion I would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

In comparison in the United States reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992 reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males respectively (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks whites and Hispanics (15.6% 15.1% and 15.9% respectively); however the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or equal to 45 years (87.7%) these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate (639 per 100000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver metropolitan area (1990 population: 1629466) but decreased elsewhere in the state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991 the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC the primary public STD clinic in the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992 and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 94% of all cases diagnosed in males while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992 respectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e. HMO university hospital nonprofit family planning and commercial) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23%-33% from 1991 to 1992 while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth (i.e. nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991 reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison reported cases among blacks HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992 the population in Colorado increased 9.9% for blacks 9.8% for Hispanics and 4.5% for whites. In 1992 the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100000 persons) was 57 times that for whites (34 per 100000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100000) (Table 1). Among black females reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. Reported by: KA Gershman MD JM Finn NE Spencer MSPH STD/AIDS Program; RE Hoffman MD State Epidemiologist Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas MD Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention National Center for Prevention Svcs CDC. Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. However the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100000) (objective 19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk (e.g. 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g. public service radio HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 announcements signs on city buses newspaper advertisements and posters in schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted primarily at high-risk groups and 3) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985 all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8%-59% (34) motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1) while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for those aged 0-4 years; 57% aged 5-11 years; and 29% aged 12-18 years) (5). In addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household CDC analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this study. Data were available for 20905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents 5499 (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e. always buckle up) and 2) less than consistent use (i.e. almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up). Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these six (Arizona Kentucky Maine Nebraska Rhode Island and West Virginia) had no law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho Maryland Pennsylvania and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e. a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e. vehicles could be stopped for a safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states child-passenger protection HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 laws included all children aged less than 5 years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law requiring adult safety-belt use (law states) and 2) those without such a law (no-law states). Overall 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05 chi-square test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 43.2% respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety-belt users 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups (i.e. aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no-law states regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety-belt use (8). Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion CDC. Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children (69). Because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report. Accordingly occupant-protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e. Head Start) that are directed at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 they become older. Parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety-belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts. Finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS -- UNITED STATES 1983-88 Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan Atlanta Georgia and selected jurisdictions in California for the years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639837 births in California and 152970 births in metropolitan Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation/dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney/ureter and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability. However differences in the prevalences of arm/hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES 1988-89 Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from October through May. Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance conducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season influenza A(H1N1) and B viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2) but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the 1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza A(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993 The University of Arizona High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978 a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include IVF-ET gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT) embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. Ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management. However when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the ART procedures. Therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies. The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our Center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: o in vitro o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET)  gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o (GIFT)  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex-linked disorders. The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children. Catherine Racowsky Ph.D. Associate Professor and Director of Research Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology College of Medicine University of Arizona Tucson Arizona Applications Success Rates and Advances for the Management of Infertility The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days before they are transferred to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer- HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform IVF-ET or indeed GIFT follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins (perganol metrodin) gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH Factrel lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron Depo lupron synarel). Occasionally however IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our Infertility Unit with the patient sedated. Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and/or mild forms of male factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry the overall success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle. Results from our program involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 IVF-ET cycles reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle attempts. However among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception. Therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our Center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to IVF-ET involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo IVF with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility. The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed benefit the patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between January 1 1991 and December 31 1992 we have performed a total of 12 GIFT cycles with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore as stipulated by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all Assisted Reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI) which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. Therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception.

The network is expected to cost between $75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton administration's health reform  plan according to the CDC and outside experts.  The plan will  require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in the United  States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to track disease. ===================================================================== April 13 1993 ===================================================================== NIH Plans to Begin AIDS Drug Trials at Earlier Stage Nature (04/01/93) Vol. 362 No. 6419 P. 382  (Macilwain Colin) HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion resulting from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was  previously believed.  Anthony Fauci director of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)  said We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will get around microbial resistance.  He said any delay would signify questions over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature rejects the argument by one of his co-authors Cecil Fox that the new  discovery indicates that $1 billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started  too long after the patients were infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  We've known about this for five years but we're  glad it is now in the public domain said Jesse Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg who believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the West said We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even if these papers are right. ====================================================================== April 14 1993 ====================================================================== Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal Washington Post (04/14/93) P. A9 The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care professionals to patients is minimal according to new research  published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire Maryland and Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found that none of the  1174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland 413 of 1131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital were found to be HIV-negative.  Similarly  in Florida 900 of 1192 dental HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 43 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 patients who all had been  treated by an HIV-positive general dentist were tested and found to be negative for HIV.  The Florida researchers led by Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine said This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal precautions are strictly observed.

The OAM is a small division of the NIH with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition the money for available research grants is even smaller.  About $500000 to $600000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean of the Center  for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington D.C. says  the OAM is afraid to become involved in AIDS.  They have to look successful and there is no easy answer in AIDS she said.    There is also a common perception that the OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year  the AIDS community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition activists' general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg of ACT-UP/New York said The OAM advisory panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It will take them several years to accept the nature of research. Nevertheless  Dr. Leanna Standish research director and AIDS  investigator at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle said Here is a wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the Office time to gel but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much much more [than  public relations]. ====================================================================== Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143 No. 14 P. 215   (Fackelmann Kathy A.) Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack causes the killer cells to malfunction  diminishing an important component in the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also the herpesvirus-6 may be a factor in  immune diseases such as AIDS.  In 1989 Paolo Lusso's research found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell the CD4  T-lymphocyte which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack  according to Anthony L. Komaroff a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube findings scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface receptor making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. ====================================================================== April 15 1993 ==================================================================== AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor Journal of the American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269  No. 13 P. 1636  (Gellert George and Nordenberg Dale F.) All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health problems but also to be committed to related  policies write George Gellert and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency Santa Ana Calif. and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta Ga. respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations. Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach to international health and development in general and  HIV/AIDS in particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book Earth in the Balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to  promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing  world.  If enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health. ==================================================================== AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply Journal of the American HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269  No. 13 P. 1636  (Berkley Seth) Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a  cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York N.Y. in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS such as malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention than they are getting Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic diseases the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in  disease burden but financially is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the United States for the AIDS  epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS. Anthony S. Fauci M.D. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.  If these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10000 children in the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 stimulate new ones.  It will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. The results from the pediatric trial known as ACTG 218 will be examined closely for other reasons as well.  This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines said Daniel Hoth M.D. director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in children. In the United States most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city areas and more than 80 percent are minorities mainly black or Hispanic. Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children. HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults. The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. Study chair John S. Lambert M.D. of the University of Rochester Medical School and co- chair Samuel Katz M.D. of Duke University School of Medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara M.D. medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said Dr. McNamara.  We'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects.   He emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 products. The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden Conn. contains gp160--a protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant. Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy in Emeryville Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein gp120 plus adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum while the Biocine vaccine contains MF59 an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive. If the low dose is well-tolerated controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin. Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the HIV genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals' immunity the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV itself caused the skin disease. Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses. Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this problem scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material. NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals. Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in l988.  Those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth.  In the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of HIV which allowed the animals to live longer. Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart-like tumors on their necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans.  No skin lesions developed in their normal non-transgenic littermates. Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals. Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said Dr. Kopp. The scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions Dr. Kopp said. Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin. Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said.  No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter Dickie who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg Drs. Nickolas Dorfman Joseph Bryant Abner Notkins and Paul Klotman all of NIDR; Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or AIDS. The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Hospital. Secretary Shalala said One goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks.  Currently many providers refer patients with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience. Secretary Shalala said This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available. The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413 and it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) Monday through Friday.  During these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour.  At other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible. Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing HIV care including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials. When a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant asks for patient-specific information including CD4 cell count current medications sex age and the patient's HIV history. This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 responded to nearly 1000 calls from health care providers in northern California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project and by the American Academy of Family Physicians. When providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients said HRSA Administrator Robert G. Harmon. M.D. M.P.H.  This project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve. This service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on HIV care management said HRSA's associate administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources Development G. Stephen Bowen M.D. M.P.H.  Providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs treatment methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS. HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week. Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received: John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier Again thank you to all who gave! I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems. It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett Packard Scanners. When initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options; (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner fax file disk file (3) automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document I would like scanned and in what order. Once an image is scanned you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The software gives you two errors at this point.  Blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary. Yellow shade which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more credit.  It is usually correct instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. After a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate TIFF or PCX file format. I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 an Intel Satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format. While most of my faxes were received in standard mode (200x100 dpi) the accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. Overall a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just too small. If anyone has any specific questions please do not hesitate to send me email.

Since the early 1970s the U.S. public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g. Escherichia coli O157:H7 hepatitis C virus human immunodeficiency virus Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis (TB) have increased in many areas. Furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis TB and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings (e.g. hospitals and child day care centers) and minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs (3). This issue of MMWR introduces a new series Emerging Infectious Diseases. Future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control and prevention efforts by health-care providers and public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). References 1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain. Washington On January 13 1993 a physician reported to the Washington Department of Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17 a case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January 18 a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants was initiated. As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts during January- February 1993 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant 312 (92%) reported eating a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 developed HUS and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years (range: 0-74 years). Idaho Following the outbreak report from Washington the Division of Health Idaho Department of Health and Welfare identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection with illness onset dates from December 11 1992 through February 16 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset 13 (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California In late December the San Diego County Department of Health Services was notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was reported reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7 with onset from November 15 1992 through January 31 1993. Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen persons were hospitalized seven developed HUS and one child died. The median age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada On January 22 after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten at a local chain A restaurant the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured or any diarrheal illness with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7 with onset from December 1 1992 through February 7 1993. Because local laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools for E. coli O157:H7 this organism was not identified in any patient. After SMAC medium was distributed the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of one patient 38 days after illness onset. Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C) nine were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: 0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings During the outbreak chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 19 1992; some of the same meat was used in jumbo patties produced on November 20 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272672 (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS the most common cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen. Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 SMAC medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days but 2%-7% of patients develop HUS which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of 3%-5%. This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases. E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear. In this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 F (86.1 C) (FDA personal communication 1993). Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This report summarizes findings from this survey. The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked Have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life? and Do you use snuff now? Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (3). In 1991 an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users of smokeless tobacco including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533000 (0.6%) women. For all categories of comparison the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among men. For men the prevalence of use was highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 men and women below the poverty level * this difference was significant only for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). Among men the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although women rarely used smokeless tobacco the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons aged 18-24 years the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years the proportion of former users was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 95% CI=68.9-78.1). Among current users of smokeless tobacco 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) currently smoked 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked and 43.8% (95% CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison among current smokers 2.6% (95% CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6). Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics National Center for Health Statistics CDC. Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males in particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders (4). Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation. For example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (56). In this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous study among college students 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 occasionally (7). In addition approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging health-care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up providing school-based prevention and cessation interventions and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution. The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws. People with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said Joel Schwartz Ph.D. of the Environmental Protection Agency who was the lead author of the study.  When people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge. The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of PM. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air. In Seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10 the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent. The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory Disease an official journal of the American Thoracic Society the Lung Association's medical section. The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery Ph.D. of Harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60000 premature deaths each year in the United States. Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children. Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says Dr. Schwartz.  But more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well.      One problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 acid aerosols. Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says Dr. Schwartz.  We have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.   Consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research like the Seattle study. Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any time soon.  Until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles. In some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that's rarely particulate matter says Dr.  Schwartz.  However PM10 doesn't have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.

Following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. Among their findings the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; (2) thin invasive melanoma less than 1 millimeter thick has the potential for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma.

Within the program there are four types of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14) which engage primarily in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12) which focus on clinical research; comprehensive cancer centers (28) which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1) which specialize in cancer prevention and control research. Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s it was the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research.  Over the next two decades the centers' program grew progressively. In 1990 there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today there are 28 of these institutions all of which meet specific NCI criteria for comprehensive status. To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly established in 1990 the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice. Moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also referred to as a P30 or core grant) the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of sources. The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers 14 are of the basic science type. These centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory. Clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. Finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs. Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. Together the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Copyright 1993 Information Inc. Bethesda MD ================================================================== April 12 1993 ================================================================== NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines Reuters (04/08/93)  (Frank Jacqueline) Washington--The Clinton administration will permit the National Institutes of Health to test multiple AIDS vaccines instead of  only allowing the Army to test a single vaccine administration  sources said Thursday.  The decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of Health which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies including Genentech Inc. Chiron Corp. and  Immuno AG have already told NIH that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time. The report was inaccurate  and I expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project said Shalala. Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years. ================================================================== HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6 Number 10                                           April 20 1993 The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. 114 No. 14 P. 18 AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome the manufacturer of AZT made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the drug.  However a team of  European researchers recently reported that although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment that benefit disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of the three-year study which could give more reason  for critics to argue the drug's cost side effects and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of AIDS symptoms.

"2","GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) GB> >(I am excepting migraine which is arguably neurologic). GB> I hope you meant inarguably. Given the choice I would rather argue <g>. No arguments about migranous aura; in fact current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia). Migraine without aura however is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen Olesen et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura and (unlike migraine with aura but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF. From one (absurd) perspective *all* pain is neurologic because in the absence of a nervous system there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic. Whether neurologic or not nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues scrounging for cases want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary however I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain. --- . SLMR 2.1 . E-mail: jim.zisfein@factory.com (Jim Zisfein)"

Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo. depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects I currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment.

The *only* reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny insisting that tradition or anecdotal evidence are sufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crook's ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence.

This disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992 the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease. He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive. After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in September all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis. The patient's oncologist although telling him he would probably not live past December 1992 was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's treatment she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments saying if it ain't broke don't fix it. Dr. Burzynski is an M.D. Ph.D. with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.  There is little understanding of the actual mechanism of activity. /*********************************************************************/ /*                      --- David E.

Any other info relevant to the vibrational or acoustical properties of these would be useful to me. Thanks... Bill Christens-Barry cerulean@access.digex.com"

The University of Washington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard UNC]) has a department and advanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat and there are plenty of MDs PhDs and postdocs doing Biostatistical work. People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well. Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover. The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses 100 doctors and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS student in a thesis. --bruce"
"2","Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions (2) promote communication of states with in a cell (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example) and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not. Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred years old but not a popular activity.  Perhaps except in the case of a few tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes it is hard to reduce the investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding the healing of broken bones but not understood why. Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as when Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural cause to explain things we don't yet understand."

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the disease that was being asked about systemic yeast syndrome. There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.  It also seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I've never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though presumably it would work by the same mechanism). Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major pathogen.

"2","Hello I am interested in trying this desensitization (?) method against hay fever. What is the state of affairs about this. I went to a doctor and paid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches leading to the diagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grass. I believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week for 6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot costs $20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system I would call that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office. Apart from this issue I was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that right? Thanks for information. Ej"

We have a name here that implies certain things to many people.  Rather than trying to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there some name that would imply what this group was originally intended for? My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler for meaning.  In my reality psychoactives *technically* could range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more standard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like some of the drugs you mention but also possibly including *some* recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive effects -- the recent query about bong water I thought was a bit off topic -- so I just hit k. But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution -- what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs or something similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to describe alot of those drugs.  There is a big difference between a drug that if taken in certain doses over a period of days may have a psychoactive effect in some people vs. many of the drugs in PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive. wm -- :: If pro-choice means choice after conception does this apply to men too? ::"

Indurkhya TUTORIAL PROGRAM Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on Tuesday July 6. 12:00-2:45pm Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer Scientists  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University) This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain. Material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology. 12:00-2:45pm Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Biologists  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.) An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications.  Fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning.  The intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. Lathrop co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry. 3:00-5:45pm Neural Networks Statistics and Information Theory in Biological Sequence Analysis Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos National Laboratory) This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain. 3:00-5:45pm Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming Prof. John Koza (Stanford University) The genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field. 3:00-5:45pm Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute) Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness.

I read a good book while I was away THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS ARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE Stuart B. Levy M.D. 1992 Plenum Press ISBN:0-306-44331-7. It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It is interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of understanding scientific concepts but who may not yet have been exposed to this particular information. I.e. it assumes you are smart enough to understand it but it does not assume that you already have a degree in microbiology or medicine.

The following is from a critique of a 60 Minutes presentation on MSG which was aired on November 3rd 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...] Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November 3rd [1991] you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In the segment entitled 'No MSG' for instance show host Ed Bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violently sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are. Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items causes headaches.  What he does NOT make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits. One of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologist Patricia Williams Ph.D. says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get headaches from it.  'But' she explains 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem.' A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney a professor at the Washington University School of Medicine who Mr. Bradley remarks 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human youngsters. In fact only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected extremely high doses of MSG into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course neither of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very little reaches the bloodstream -- much to little in fact for human blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in Dr. Olney's lab animals..... The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific Committee for Food....Both after examining numerous studies have concluded that MSG is safe. Their determination makes sense considering that MSG has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it -- headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and a burning sensation among others.  In fact the most fail-safe of clinical studies the double-blind study... has consistently exonerated the much-maligned substance. That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broken down into glutamate during digestion. It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods 20 percent in milk 25 percent in corn and 29 percent in whole wheat. That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large international professional organizations [is that MSG is safe] the same consensus reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large. -Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

Without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general there are no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from recurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as recurrence while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the intestine.

"2","I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way they must be a quack. I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession. In animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth stomach small and large intestine) sinuses vagina and on the skin.  These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body he would not(or at least should not) be calling Elaine's doctor a quack. Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an E. Coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed. Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina.  In diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it. If it's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript. Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the GI tract(mouth stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier.  If they do an inflammatory response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom. While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun) then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says. But even in patients being given the anti-fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics). In the GI system the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place.  After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor and so on.  Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant basis I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better Steve Dyer calls him a quack. Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments sex returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome. The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). Some of the above material was obtained from Natural Healing by Mark Bricklin Published by Rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the GI system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut. If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.

Interesting statements simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm certainly not questioning Steve's claims as for one I am not a doctor and I agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food. Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough caveat :-) I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be realized by the patient) any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problem. Therefore anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's of the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting of: Completely out - never again - items: o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-) o popcorn (same) o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-) Discouraged greatly: o raw vegetables (too fibrous) o wheat and raw grain breads o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water) o greens (turnip mustard kale etc...) o little seeds like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!) o long grain and wild rice (husky) o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!) o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few) to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad don't do it again! Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more thoroughly - you're mileage may vary. As with anything else CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But this is the info I've been given and it may be a starting point for discussion.  Good luck! -Spenser -- S.

While most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have RD's who are in private practice so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get your friend's physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's plan doesn't it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet. Marty B."
"2","The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle and choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin usually given intra muscularly use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot on the upper outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). Clean the area with antiseptic before injection and after. Make sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it pierces the skin). PS: Try to go to a doctor. Self-treatment and self-injection should be avoided as far as possible."

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist.  :^) Actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population NT's comprise only about 12% of the population but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?) One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious choleric behavior (driver type A etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control to lead and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted they are best described as Field Marshalls.  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However when the NT person has self-image challenges the dark-side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all. A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling) and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most to know it all). Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^) Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom. >Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have >no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that >balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Of course I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis' but being the phlegmatic I am maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.

A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this >happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. In my well-described situation (in prior posts) I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans mucus color (won't get into the details) and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below). The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection. >Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals >and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what >vitamin A does in the body he would not(or at least should not) be calling >Elaine's doctor a quack. I was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor after my blood tests put me on 75000 IU of vitamin A for one week only then dropped it down to 25000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement) and made sure that I maintain a 50000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^) Hopefully Elaine's doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gram/day which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage. >survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina.  In Though I do now believe based on my successful therapy with Sporanox that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal). BTW my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry can't remember which one) and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion. >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus >membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to >the candida or not isn't certain. My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive. Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a M.D. degree or a Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis. BTW and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker in his book Sinus Survival has routinely given before anything else Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn't cure it by any means implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help. This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again I admit lots of 'ifs' and 'implies' which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation a strawman if you will. >If it's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty >nondescript. This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body. It's a real Catch-22. Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big $ to do it right.  However in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results. It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister... >Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in >the sinuses the GI tract(mouth stomach and intestines) and in the >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong >inflammatory response after a candida bloom. Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia? >While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of >this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which >knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main >competition for candida as far as food is concerned.

Again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (roots) into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks) that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract candidiasis.  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away. The $60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g. allergy) without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal. >In the GI system the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good >reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very >favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and >humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

When I finally find a >doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better Steve Dyer calls him a quack. As I've said in private e-mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example I went to three ENT's who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin C lentinen echinacea etc.) my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to live with it.  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total cure.  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.) >...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic >GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his >patients is a non-existent syndrome. Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said you'll just have to live with it.  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient. Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth (e.g. they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified) should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment and as a result I have found significant relief. Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: well I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don't work for you I now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.  Anyway if my ENT had suggested this to me I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work (like my case) and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it and it is fairly consistent will is very important.  First it points to the necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed out before pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One person's make-believe can easily be another person's reality.  Using psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example the hallucinations one person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going to happen.  Anyhow that was a pretty lame example but hopefully I made my point- it's all a matter of perception and as long as someone ingesting MSG perceives it as causing bad effects then s/he can definitely experience those affects.  On the other hand it could just be an allergy to the food it's in   or something.  Still anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that leads to the study being done. -Dan"

I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle and barely feel it.  I'm not fat just have a little gut.  My legs however are muscular and I have to pinch to get anything and then I inject at about a 45 degree angleand it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in the puncture and of course that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2  apart.) This is from experience so I hope it'll help you.

"2","Hi I've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few concerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks I think she mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add that I had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and I have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended I not walk or move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for when I do need to go out.) Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about 2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated. (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks and it is still bile related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when I was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position I was in.  Next I noticed that when I ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse.  However if I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it wasn't as much of a problem. So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid fatty foods.  This makes sense and because I was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods. But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts fried food cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( potatoes pasta rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if I'm not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which I can't seem to find any information on.  She originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be temporary for that one week. What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I would understand if she had said low-fat diet since I'm trying that anyway even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to use the energy from the food I do eat. Any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I don't find any foods satisfying. Thanks G"

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing but if a food causes problems avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize. There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's. And as I always say when dealing with Crohn's as does Spencer Good Luck! Steve Holland"

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis. Previously low residue diets were recommended but this advice has now changed.  Also there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining so input by the physician will be important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice and I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing them since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.

"2","I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys). Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams per day). 1. Review Article Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev. 5(3):110-129(1985). But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both glycine and vitamin C one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin B6. 2. Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988) 200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program. 3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria Clin. Sci. 38 :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels. For gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C the effect is quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism. The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day) more of the extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 85:190-92(1954) intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose 4 gram dose 8 gram dose and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation. B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient in B6 some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -151980).  If 400mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion. Here are the high oxalate foods: 1. Beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea. Contain at least 25mg/100grams 2. Beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe. Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams. If the threshold is 130mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6 you shouldn't have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months). The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 requirement) as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block B6 absorption are metabolic antagonists of B6 or promote B6 excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given B6 supplements. One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium-oxalate. 4. The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculiInvest. Urol 10:147(1972) 5. Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium interactionJ. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990). 6.Review Article Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987). There are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them I thought I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her and one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome. Now what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that it exists.

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias).  Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign.  Having a few irregular beats on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred or could be of no significance.

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought virtually impossible to test for. Indeed I would be surprised if candida overbloom were such a phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the extent of recent infection.

"2","One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs). I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease MacDermott Stenson. 1992.] But if I recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies) but if I recall correctly there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA then the ratio of bad prostanoid products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad. Isn't this ratio the issue? What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories). -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>"
"2","I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and seizures.  I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies but here it is again. Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two other groups so the mechanics would be easy. If you are interested mail me a note.  If I get enough replies I will make it happen and provide you with the details. BTW I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system. This database is still small and sparse but we are adding new information.

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine Jan. 1988 I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs. Astonishly there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands recurrent fevers and nightsweats etc. that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows but theories include: psychological stress some sort of virus (a retrovirus say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses) environmental toxins bacteria (and yes candida) genes (and/)or some combo of these. There's no outright cure at the moment but different docs try different things some of which seem to help. Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days. Post your Q to alt.med.cfs and you will be flooded w/facts. Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable) diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good doc."

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the Yeast Connection that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.

Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion). I'll give you some examples. 1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication. 2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss. 3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by the NCI. These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard approved procedures others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the healer's oath I will do no harm.  But you know David that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases) I don't see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethical. What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals. These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine.  But many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted this alternative care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky you may find someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo- medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the liscened physicians). I hope that this clears things up David. Marty B."

There is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids and I am looking forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are doing. You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  By the way the abbreviation EPA is not in general use so I do not know what fatty acid you are speaking about. And to Brian an U of C ---  There is a physician named Stephen Hanauer there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You might give him a call.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean traditional crew-cut talk to the AMA before starting any treatment kind) who recommend treatments that though accepted may not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color.  In fact I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and- destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help. *************************************************** Now to make a general comment on many recent posts: *************************************************** Lately I've seen the word quack bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner all he/she has to do is say quack-quack and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach you in medical school - how to throw your authority around? Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  quack is a nebulous word lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand. The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming from any medical doctor (or wanna-be) where competency is expected is real scary. But what do I know I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this newsgroup as being 'anal retentive' and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more net.diagnoses.  Hey they're free.

"2","I am writing this to find out the following: 1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis. 2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery. 3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer. My boyfriend age 34 and otherwise in good health was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta Tagamet) as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed. These treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen wrap and a Hill Repair.  He opted for the Hill Repair. He recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva). The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called Barrett's Syndrome. If he can't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer? Basically if anyone has any information on what he should do now I'd appreciate it.

"2","rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSP's) and DNA. I hate to be derogatory but in this case I think it's warranted. HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD! Also who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be completely digested in your stomach which is about pH 2. Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy balanced diet and relax. My advice is if you don't know what you are talking about it is better to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your ignorance.

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity Boltzman constant mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter and you get sick and die. I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book I would imagine you would have to: 1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water. 2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium. During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy. You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here. Come to think of it <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested so hospitalisation might be too late. The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be heavy.  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat it's hard to digest anyway. For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle. Be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract. Try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous. Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible. Nausea etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble. Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby.

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. There are people ahead of their time with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned absurd theorists. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who. Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon. Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't or can't be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease they haven't developed something recognizable yet or they have something that no one is going to recognize because it hasn't been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure sometimes the illness wears out sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment sometimes they find it's incurable. There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking. -Jackie-"

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are qualified to read x-rays u/s ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing else and thus is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of practice).

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the crazy theory were true you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals many of them appear to get better. So if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case please there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative. And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight making wild claims with no evidence and always refusing to do controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some other reason (besides the quacks) if only anecdotal to think it could be true then that is what has to be considered that is what the net people have been talking about. But again there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal evidence and there is no convincing evidence and there are also some candida quacks out there I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test just carry it out themselves!) --- and also whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

"2","My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome. This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it. I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions). I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia. I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology. Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much improvement in her condition over the past several months. -Jackie-"

"2","SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA Bosnia Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August. But after treating 4000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war he considers himself a surgeon. ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'' Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there. ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce'' he told reporters. Mujanovic 31 had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1396 times relying on books for guidance amputating arms and legs 150 times usually without anesthetic delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections. He worked 18-to-19-hour days slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4000 patients. He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain he said. His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children. The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street'' he said. ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.'' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools facilities and medicine. The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'' Once he arrived the situation improved he said but by mid-September he had run out of supplies. ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding. ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types. ``I felt destroyed psychologically'' Mujanovic said. The situation improved after Dec. 4 when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres. But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.'' Then the hunger set in. Between mid-December and mid-March when U.S. planes began air dropping food between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition he said. ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation'' he said. According to Mujanovic around 5000 people died in Srebrenica 1000 of them children during a year of siege. Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife who is ill in Tuzla. ``They say I'm a hero'' he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.'' -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham MA  USA e-mail: sharon@world.std.com"

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms. (To understand this skepticism one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.) On the other hand I am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility spurred by suggestive clinical experience to research it further.  The doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.) I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another.  (And indeed perhaps some of them do know -- I am the one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest route and so I am happy with it. Russell"

Gee I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself my friends and my family but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than Aunt Susie's brother-in-law .... Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.

"2","Putting aside our substantial differences I'd like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain. One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans. She then had MRI scans done where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is in the lungs and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago).

Well I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing. UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels. > PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up I am just > trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it > might seem. Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple explanation - I won't eat this stuff I WON'T cook with this stuff so I can either throw it out or give it away.) > From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee) > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.

But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test. Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times.

"2","Last year I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have caused it.  That is I hadn't been lifting more than other people do and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more painful and I had the repair operation. This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for another fun 8-) operation. I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38 years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness but if so why did it suddenly appear when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger? Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia other than not lifting anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack full of groceries and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that will reduce the risk? Of course my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at the computer reading news... -- J.

"2","The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did. ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission] There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services On a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors' earnings is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10. It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called Families USA. The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe that doctors make too much money. The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for physicians.  Those polled said oh about $80000 a year would be OK. How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid. Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering. You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $100000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks  they assume that those  who do are stealing it from them. Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down  but don't  kid  yourself. Karl Marx lives. It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions  such as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to become a physician? If those polled said no  they didn't know then they should have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers  they should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor? Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  How much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better  and (c) spend four more  years of  grinding study in medical school  with the third and  fourth years in clinical training  working 80 to 100 hours a week  and (d) spend another year as a low-pay  hard-work intern  and  (e) put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100000  in debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 hours  a week  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or more until they retire or fall over? As  you have probably guessed by now  I  have  considerably more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and Clinton  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have called together to remake America's health care. Based  on what doctors contribute to society  they are  far more useful than the power-happy  ego-tripping program-spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality. But propaganda works.   And  as the stupid poll  indicates many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the major cause of high medical costs. Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be. Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers  Congress or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's? And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become a  nation  of  self-indulgent   lard-butted   TV-gaping   couch cabbages. Ah  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain they might have been more honest if they had said: Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest problems we have.   That problem is you my fellow American. Yes you  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure. You  and  your habits  not the  doctors  are  the  single biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything  it  is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do. In fact  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at your blubbery bods all day. So as your president  I call upon you to stop whining  and start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say not as I do. But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid there is another solution: Don't use them. That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those spine poppers  needle twirlers or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit. Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror  make a slit here a slit there and pop in a couple of valves. You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)? Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it. And if it survives  you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots. By  the  way  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much pollsters should earn?

Julie it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic to it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats and like their taste yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them (regularly).

Message-ID: <25APR199316225142@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu> Organization: Florida State University - School of Higher Thought News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1 First I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go through this.  I know it has to have been tough. There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of the body as easily.  In addition medications and interactions between medications can cause confusion. As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after the drug has been discontinued I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything to that effect.  However I also had not been looking for that information. I can see what I can find... I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug and according to the Nursing93 Drug handbook it is Especially useful for agitation associated with senile dementia  (p. 400).  It also should not be discontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting effects. Because so many things can cause confusion it is hard for me to know what else was going on at the time; if I had more history i might be able to answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have happened. Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu"

The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points. Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling. Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early. Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient. Even so there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks not the gross change that the original poster noted. Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing more it is hard to comment. Don Mackie - his opinions esiology will disavow..."
"2","I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen drugs were definitely involved. My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital. He was fifty-three at the time and he was on 21 separate medications. The family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well! With the help of an MD friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued. He had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug. Two days later he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions. I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe that because they have close control of you it's quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake but health care providers can make mistakes too and mistakes can be deadly under those circumstances. I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless I suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL at all. HALDOL may have been used validly or it may have been prescribed because OTHER medication confused her and because the hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly. Just my opinion -Larry (obviously not a doc) C."

Unfortunately doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes the patient's blood pressure to go up many times an antihypertensive is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug. This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs at home!!!! >....procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss >it with an independent doc.

In addition she proably should be examined by another doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking. I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during a lecture but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician is unwilling to do this find one who will.  Either check the phone book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society. By finding a geriatric specialist he (she) will more likely be in tune with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help."

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. Data on discharges from short-stay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS conducted by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. For 1991 medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31000 (11%) women discharged after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from national vital registration data. Therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95% confidence level based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96. In 1991 there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean rate (i.e. number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. In 1991 the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6 significantly (p<0.05) higher than the rates for the West (19.8) Midwest (21.8) and Northeast (22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. Since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older women increased; however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 essentially the same as the 23.5 observed. Based on the NHDS of the approximately 4111000 live births in 1991 an HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 estimated 966000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these an estimated 338000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans and 628000 (65.0%) were primary cesareans. Since 1986 approximately 600000 primary cesareans have been performed annually. In 1986 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991 35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean 30.4% with dystocia (i.e. failure of labor to progress) 11.7% with breech presentation 9.2% with fetal distress and 13.7% with all other specified complications. The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days and for a repeat cesarean 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 days). In 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days for primary cesareans 5.2 days for repeat cesareans 4.7 days and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days respectively. Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems National Center for Health Statistics CDC. Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986; however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births (5). Moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example in 1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and $4720 respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5 the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349000 (617000 versus 966000) resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges. Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery. For example VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). Of women who are offered a trial of labor 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35% based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate. One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer-review process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery (4).

Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably. During May 1992 the Office of Medical Services Department of State (OMS/DOS) and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala Uganda. A review of the health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU OMS/DOS and CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This report summarizes the results of the investigation. Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons 17 were slide- confirmed as having malaria. A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures (i.e. using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey 128 (82%) responded. Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 years (11/94 12%) this difference was not significant (relative risk RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria. Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey: mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine alone and proguanil alone. In addition 23 (18%) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening (0/16) compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening. As a result of this investigation EHU staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel. Reported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit Kampala Uganda; Office of Medical Svcs Dept of State Washington D.C. Malaria Br Div of Parasitic Diseases National Center for Infectious Diseases CDC. Editorial Note: In Uganda the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas. Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however in some areas (e.g. Thailand) resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In Africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis (e.g. psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e. 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100000 users 2) while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen (34). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance (e.g. Southeast Asia and Africa).

Vaccines against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate ActHIB Trademark) * for vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine (TETRAMUNE Trademark) a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria tetanus pertussis and Hib disease. ActHIB Trademark On March 30 1993 the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T) manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories Inc. (Swiftwater Pennsylvania). This vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2 4 and 6 months. Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2 4 and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 for use in infants (4). In these studies no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark On March 30 1993 the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl River New York) combines two previously licensed products DTP (TRIIMMUNOL Registered manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River New York) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered manufactured by Praxis Biologics Inc. Rochester New York). This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years for protection against diphtheria tetanus pertussis and Hib disease when indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected to provide protection against Hib as well as diphtheria tetanus and pertussis equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 4 6 and 15-18 months of age and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology School of Dentistry University of California San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance. The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries including Asia Africa Europe Central America South America as well as the United States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National Institute of Dental Research the National Cancer Institute the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the NIH Office of AIDS Research and the Procter and Gamble Company. Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics professional responsibility and public policy; occupational issues; provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and women's issues. Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. Epidemiology Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 radically changed.  In 1988 HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs. Today more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents. While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well. Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time. Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis. Social/political Issues Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is and how it is acquired. Saliva and Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and 2) direct effects on the virus or target cells. Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth.

Recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. Occupational and Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit of HIV testing patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.

The drug which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection. The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent effective. This drug presents another long-term effective option for women to prevent pregnancy said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler M.D. As an injectable given once every three months Depo Provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose. Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the injections. As with any such products FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it. Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries. U.S. clinical trials begun in 1963 also found Depo Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive. The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain dizziness weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood clots in the legs lungs or eyes. The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect. Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo Mich. which will market the drug under the name Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. At that time animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer including breast cancer in humans to be minimal if any. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses P92-37 Food and Drug Administration Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177 The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life- threatening illnesses such as AIDS cancer and Alzheimer's disease. These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan M.D. The effort to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration. These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers. They apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established. The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19 using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the cause of AIDS. Accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when FDA determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan. The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight said FDA commissioner David A. Kessler M.D. While drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment This research published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness. In addition each year more than 15000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) Foundation Fighting Blindness Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail Kazuhiko Unoki Douglas Yasurnura Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF arld Dr. C;eorge Yancoooulos Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from UCSF. In the research described in the PNAS  a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. Discussing the research Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum Regeneron's Director of Clinical Research said BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration one of the leading causes of vision impairment and for retinal detachment. Following detachment permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically. Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life stated Jeanette S. Felix Ph.D. Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. In addition to the work described  Regeneron is developing BDNF in conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy motor neuron diseases Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. By itself Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals Inc. based in Tarrytown New York is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

These findings according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries. This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism. These native Mexicans number approximately 50000 and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated the name Tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball. The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs.  Their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat. The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values are in the good low-risk range according to the researchers.  Elevated cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol. Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators' direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness. Thirteen Tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for 1 week followed by 5 weeks of an affluent diet. In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index or CSI recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the LDL Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's affluent diet used in the study ranks a CSI of 149. The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on a plateau Dr. Connor says. After 5 weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent primarily in the LDL fraction which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in weight.  According to Dr. Connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations.  We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption. In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study Dr. Connor explains. Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat intake. Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a CSI around 20 varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a Mediterranean-style diet.  The original Mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation. The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen.  If the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology Dr. Connors says. The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly he concludes.

But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague  who has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate professional regulatory body.  The guidelines  also emphasize the significance of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an infected health-care  worker.  A model letter to patients who have come into contact  with such an individual is provided along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media.  In addition a  U.K. advisory panel on HIV infection in health-care workers has  been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients. ================================================================== Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine' Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362 No. 6420 P. 504 (Volvovitz Franklin and Smith Gale) The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages rather than disadvantages write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys in Meriden  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune responses including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody responses against native HIV-1 proteins  including the types described by Moore et al. exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 progression of HIV disease.  In addition the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts stimulation of cytotoxic T cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function.  Based on  these and other clinical results MicroGeneSys gp160 was chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first phase III vaccine therapy studies conclude Volvovitz and  Smith. ================================================================== HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341 No. 8850 P. 930  (Mok Jacqueline) There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of leukocytes  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to barely detectable levels lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to twelve months with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA. Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human  milk factor.  In the developing world where infectious disease  and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality  breast milk is still the best food for infants regardless of the mother's HIV status. Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS concludes Mok. ================================================================== Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269  No. 14 P. 1802 (Dickinson Gordon M. et al.) If universal precautions are practiced the risk of HIV  transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal write Gordon M. Dickinson HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 43 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 et al. of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami Fla.  The researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed and DNA sequence  analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail. There were  1192 patients who had undergone 9267 procedures of whom 124 were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients identified five who had died with HIV infection all of  whom were either homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1048 patients and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was reported in five of the  900 patients including four who had clear evidence of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which  universal precautions are strictly observed conclude Dickinson  et al. ================================================================ April 22 1993 ================================================================ AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB Study Says Washington Post (04/22/93) P. A13 Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a  study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a  new TB infection doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford University director of the  study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may  be necessary for some people to use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County Hospital  in New York. ================================================================ HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341 No. 8850 P. 930  (Mok Jacqueline) There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue Schechter et al. call Duesberg's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to AIDS a hindrance to public health initiatives.   However their hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits. The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4 depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals from Vancouver.  However their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug- AIDS hypothesis because it  does not provide controls--i.e. confirmed drug- free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS. Alternatively they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs for 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses concludes Duesberg. ================================================================ Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341 No. 8850 P. 959   (Vento Sandro et al.) Interferon (IFN) which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases in some settings may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful  autoimmune reactions write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro Italy. The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients obtained at the end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41. These autoantibodies which also  recognize native class II molecules and may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells in vivo were at low tires (50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35 DR1 HLA antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with these HLA haplotypes the researchers conclude. ================================================================ April 23 1993 ================================================================ TB Makes a Comeback State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36 No. 4 P. 6 (Voit William and Knapp Elaine S.) Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United States it is emerging again among the homeless AIDS  patients immigrants minorities and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman professor of medicine at the University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung Association  said Right now it's a big city problem but potentially it's everyone's problem.  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected with TB and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their immune systems are depressed  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 Tammes a Centers for  Disease Control expert said that is why the CDC has issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with treatment.  In addition the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services.   In New York City TB is an epidemic because the number of cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people said Dr. George Diferdinando director of the New York State TB Control.   According to Diferdinando curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City residents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their medication multi-drug resistant TB can develop which requires  taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat. ================================================================ Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern Florida: Artifact or Reality? American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. 83 No. 4 P. 571  (Nwanyanwu Okey C. et al.) The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk write Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta Ga. The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients  in addition to records from social services HIV counseling and  testing centers and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor was found from  medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were reviewed 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification the percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties between January 1 1989 and March 31 1990 that was attributed to heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases it  still remained above the national average the researchers  conclude.

Fordham) The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal infection control procedures write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon N.H.  The researchers contacted 2317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive  procedures between January 1 1978 and June 30 1992.  The orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive for HIV.  A total of 1174 former patients  underwent HIV testing representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery. The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of the initial patient  notification and testing was $158000 with the single most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study. Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive and expensive  and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude. \ ================================================================= Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV- Infected Surgeon Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 269  No. 14 P. 1795  (Smith Rogers Audrey et al.) The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple  methodologically similar investigations writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine  in Baltimore Md.  The researchers identified a total of 1131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained.  Among  the 1131 patients 101 were dead 119 had no address 413 had  test results known and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly detected HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 person-hours of surgical exposure suggesting that HIV transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose  results were revealed only one person was found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers  conclude. ================================================================== April 20 1993 ================================================================== Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data New York Times (04/20/93) P. C10 (Kolata Gina) A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a  highly unusual move to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick president of the Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway  N.J. arranged the collaboration.  He said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that HIV when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for  resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time.  Therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently the  drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data on new AIDS drugs.  An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more  efficient way said Scolnick.  He also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups including ACT-UP. Dr. Daniel Hoth director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said We're delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for AIDS.

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of T-cell counts.  However a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected individuals and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS concludes Maddox. ================================================================== Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected Women Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341 No. 8850 P. 914   (Van de Perre Philippe et al.) A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 National AIDS Control Program in Kigali Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in breastmilk or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were enrolled at delivery in Kigali Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days 6 months and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG secretory IgA and IgM were assayed by  western blot for the latter two after removal of IgG with protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples the researchers  sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of primers (gag pol and env).  At 15  days 6 months and 18 months post partum HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent 98 percent and 97 percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent 28 percent and 41 percent; and IgM  in 66 percent 78 percent and 41 percent.  In children who  survived longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1- infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis. The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV the researchers conclude. ================================================================== April 21 1993 ================================================================== Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture Journal of Commerce (04/21/93) P. 7A A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come together said participants.  In  addition to Merck the other companies involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Burroughs Wellcome Glaxo Inc.  Hoffman-La Roche Eli Lilly & Co. Pfizer Inc. Smithkline  Beecham AB Astra Du Pont Merck Syntex Inc. Boehringer  Ingelheim Miles Inc. and Sigma-Tau.  The participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they were aware  of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993 and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) was pleased with  the news of the collaboration which it hopes will lead to the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

Following recent  highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted  HIV the department issued revised guidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman Chief Medical Officer said  doctors dentists nurses and other health-care workers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV infection including if appropriate diagnostic HIV testing.  He said Infected health care workers should not perform invasive  procedures that carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to  the virus.

A > A >  Robert Allison I tried to e-mail you but our board is having internet problems so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not. Rutin is NOT a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should generally *not* take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that) you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex. I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin after it showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be- fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin which from then on made me always *add* bioflavonoids to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin. Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead. I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose bleeds aneurysms gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs) etc... One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects. They are also non-toxic in very high amounts that's why they can be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are made from their peels) pine bark sources are available as well. About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2000mg. For major complaints 4 - 6000mg+/day is common. In case they cannot be taken because of their size and taste (they are big and they don't taste that great) a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite small and taste much better however the cost is about seven times higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark extract gives you about the same effect as 1000mg of bioflavonoids. The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.' Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are: Quest.............1000mg   big bitter not chewable Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth easier swallowing Jamieson............500mg   medium bitter chewable SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small easy swallowing Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck! -- Ron Roth -- ===================================================================== --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  -- *   Eating Radium has strange results  Tom said brightly. --- RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON] RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363"

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to spot reduce body fat other than surgically through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like fat so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the fat is changing into muscle but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate and one does not ever change into the other. ------------------------ Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu> Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA"

"2","This is to followup my previous reply on this topic which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots. 1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder which though sometimes true is misleading.  It is not often found effective particularly by itself. Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this distinction becomes important. 2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible diagnostic marker.  However this might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors which is NOT the case with OCD. One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual can and does suppress some of their 'impulses' although they are an unending source of anxiety. The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part. Some references (one non-technical and several technical) that someone was kind enough to supply for me but was unable to post themself : |The boy who couldn't stop washing by judith rapaport.   *** (technical refs) : |	pharmacotherapy of o-c disorder |	donna m jermain and lynn crismon |	pharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198 |	epidemiology of ocd |	seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen |	j clin psychiatry 1990;51(2 suppl.):10-13 |	the waking nightmare: an overview of ocd |	judith l rapoport |	j clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11 suppl.):25-28 |	absence of placebo response in ocd |	matig r mavissakalian bruce jones stephen olson |	j nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4 And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive criticism to my first post on OCD.

All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against cancer.  A physician who continued to use it when better more effective treatments are available may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden Rubenfeld through e-mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof no action is warrented. Medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way.  There has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention) was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake. The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock why doesn't it make sense for humans David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice as Gordon R. says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline. Marty B."

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves while root beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either no or less saffrole than the bark.

Is this true? Well the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make root beer there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human consumption.

Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis I've mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.

"2","I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired. Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound. Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex. Nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago. The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the difference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite so expensive. -Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon Eugene OR USA"

"2","The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids. The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations. The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable) apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'. This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though I think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff). Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations. -Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon Eugene OR USA"

What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However it is NOT part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials. One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora.  Don't try this at home. >not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.

The three active-treatment regimens and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than 0.001) but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ] CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted. Does this trial address every issue raised here no.  Jon Noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite Crook's recommendation for Nystatin).

Marty you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion. I'm lost!"
"2","This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: > 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar > intake and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms. > 	Is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey? > > Many thanks > > Michael I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms most physicians don't recognize it as a specific disease entity.  Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS. Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression) anxiety			depression irritability		forgetfulness insomnia		confusion depression		lethargy PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration) craving for sweets	weight gain increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 2. palpitations 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972). PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction B6 magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form: A. Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for a nutritional approach. 1986 A Year in Nutritional Medicine. J. Bland Ed. Keats Publishing 1986. B. Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndromes J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983). C. Premenstrual tension Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). Here are a few of these studies: CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study Effect of a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy Lancet 2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training.  After 6 months there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling tenderness and nodularity. VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study The use of Vitamin A in premenstrual tension Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). 218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200000 to 300000IU vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool size(500000IU to 1000000IU) and then see if this normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms. 10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS symptoms. Experimental Controlled Study Premenstrual tension treated with vitamin A J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts received 200000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms. After 2-6 months all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin A supplementation was stopped. Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A B6 and vitamin E) vitamin A has shown the best single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity. VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover trialJ.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo. After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of PMS(depression irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation. Experimental Double-blind Study The efects of vitamin B6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms Obstet. Gynecol 70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as behavior changes(poor mental performance decreased social interaction) Anxiety depression and water retention were not improved by B6 supplementation. Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News December 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the first-line drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study Efficacy of alpha- tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo group.  For depression the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. Experimental Double-blind Study The effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly received vitamin E at 75IU 150IU or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 2 months of supplementation 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H (other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve PMT-H symptoms). MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium Headache 31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation. After 2 months the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from PMS.  After treatment magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range. Experimental Double-blind Study Oral Magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles both groups received magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition the total score on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during PMS. There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature I have not bothered to cite them.  There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri pellagra scruvy etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS. Experimental Study Effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis Complement. Med. Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C vitamin E magnesium zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat complex carbohydrate diet.  On a retrospective analysis 96.5% of the 200pts reported an improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from PMS. Experimental Double-blind Study Role of Nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). A low fat high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program the vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle. Experimental Double-blind Study Clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this second group of patients no significant effect of supplementation on PMS symptoms was observed.

"2","Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine or the two in combination can reduce the body's ability to make use of available water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters). I drank close to twice as much as anyone else and no one else was dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general stamina so far as I could tell. It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I am wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things. I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma (24 mg. ephedrine 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both those drugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they can reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be a particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather exercise?

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C the extra vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques). The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium. 1. Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 2. The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be overemphasized.  This is a review article. 3.

Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol added to their normal food.

L. acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance(mouth anus sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do believe that complications at specific sites(vagina anal and maybe lower colon sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked. Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the pH to basically starve the candida out.

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections I'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out. The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy even in the presence of a hymen.

"2","Here is a press release from the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME Other Unions Commemorate Workers Memorial Day To: National Desk Labor Writer Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO 202-429-1130 WASHINGTON April 23 -- The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday April 28 will commemorate the fifth annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed injured or diseased on the job. This year AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work. Earlier this month an AFSCME corrections officer Robert Vallandingham was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in Lucasville Ohio. The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years.  On Jn. 1 1992 the prison population was 709587. Projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates with an expected prison population of 811253 in 1994. The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989 and remain high.  In 1987 there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff compared to 9961 such assaults in 1991. The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS Hepatitis B tuberculosis stress and chemical hazards. AFSCME has more than 50000 members who work in the nation's federal state and local correctional facilities. Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions.  Every year 10000 American workers die from job-related injuries and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include: -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are not barricaded or don't have proper lighting. -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more than 325000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private sector hospitals in 1991 up almost 10 percent over the previous year.  It is generally believed that health care workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety issues facing health care workers include exposure to tuberculosis and the HIV virus back injuries and high levels of stress. -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health institutions are often the victims of assaults and sometimes fatal attacks.  For instance last October a man carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn N.Y. and fatally shot social services workers before turning the gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a growing lack of support services for people who don't have the help they need.  Because workers are overworked some clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling. Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated. The quality of the clients is also becoming more violent as more are moved out of the institutions. Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since OSHA was passed.  Moreover as AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee explains OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees. More than 1600 public employees are killed each year on the job yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees said McEntee.  This despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers health care workers corrections officers to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful. Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe. Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed in 1970 and today public employees in more than half the states have no OSHA coverage. -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044"

We can't seem to >focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion. > >                           I'm lost! Point 1: I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I too speak jargonese when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication.  One example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic. It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non-doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient. Point 2: I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind) or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice.  And it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point-of-view. And by and large as a scientist myself I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However as also being a human being (last I checked) and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment. What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints.  In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them. This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion. Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am open to alternative therapies as well as why I have real difficulty (read apparent hostility) with the coldness of the 99.9% pure scientific approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine imho.

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ****** Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu> Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC Date: Thursday April 15 1993 ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's health care system federal health officials said Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases. Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled Emerging Infectious Diseases to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report which has a wide circulation in the health community. The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments. This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it said Dr. Ruth Berkelman deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic the first in this century she said. Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem. We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment. Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States the CDC said. It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 a deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV the virus that causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome. The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis have increased in many areas the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance. =====*===== SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE: 04/15/93 pB1 HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage: legal liability. A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property. The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $560000 to compensate for pain and suffering in addition to medical expenses and lost wages. Summer camps schools companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling says Stephen L. Kass an attorney at New York law firm Berle Kass & Case who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable. Lawsuits for insect bites while rare aren't unheard-of. A summer vacationer in Southampton N.Y. last year sued the owner of the home she rented claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 1988 also on Long Island a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant. But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country -- it's most prevalent in New England the Middle Atlantic states Wisconsin Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one. The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease. Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in worker's-compensation cases however are limited to medical costs and lost earnings. The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages because it involved the question of negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and as a result for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease. Ira M. Maurer a partner at New York law firm Elkind Flynn & Maurer who represented the rail workers says the decision will help to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease. Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For one thing victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad even though none of the men remembered being bitten. The workers who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites. A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites. Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness. Earlier this week the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease. And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes. Because of health and safety concerns some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last year at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes N.J. Becton Dickinson & Co. began using Damminix a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical- supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected. Ruth Lister a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole Katz a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association says her group spends $30000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide. =====*===== TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease. AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH Department of Urology Jefferson Medical College Thomas Jefferson University Philadelphia Pennsylvania. REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30 Lyme disease which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended.

Make a decision about whether you *really* want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant other. If you still want to be a medical doctor determine how you can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no sorry'.  I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point. Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism both about what you are saying as well as how you say it. Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor in some area don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses it usually shows. Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also. Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out. Overall a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there combined with an honest self-appraisal of skills and aptitude will be the best path to take in applying to any program medical or what-have-you. Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says 'the waiting is the hardest part' at least emotionally. :) Bob Schmieg"
"2","My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures). One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently confirmed the problems in the sinuses. He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid maxillary frontal and sphenoid along with nasal septoplasty. He explained the procedure and the risks.  What I would like to know is if there is anyone out there who can tell me I had this surgery and it helped me? (I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't really help them). I am a moderately severe asthmatic.

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to the religious cultural ethical and aesthetic mores of the parents at best or to the habit of the concerned hospital or caregivers at worst. As (prospective) parents you should do what you want in this regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions you make for your child it will have far less importance than many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents think about only a little. This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a momentous medical decision.  It is not. Russell"

"2","First off if I'm not mistaken only hibernating animals have brown fat not humans. Secondly your description sounds just like 24-dinitrophenol.  This is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's terms it short-circuits the mitochondria causing food energy to be turned into heat. 24-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled amounts it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous. It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form rather than play around with 24-DNP. But if you insist I suggest you look up the literature in your own university library.  You can obtain 24-DNP by taking a first year organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's a commonly-used reagent)."

In cats the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation. Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  In addition whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else especially food.

Since your friend is not a man she can't imagine what it's like to have a penis much less a foreskin. I guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in appearance... The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean if the cancer risk was that great the Europe who have been circumcising like crazy too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically unnecessary."

Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an antihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned if you slip up and eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms then fine otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it again when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what the side-effects were because it was new.  OK fine - but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list and anyway I was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it prescribed privately which I cannot afford or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am allergic to more than one chemical additive as a lot of things I can't eat have nothing in common except things I know are safe so testing myself isn't really an option; there are too many permutations. > I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.

Yes I've noticed that - and I can work it up by eating just under the tolerance level fairly regularly.  If I don't eat anything except home cooking for a month or so I lose it and have to work it up from scratch... a bad experience.  Now I know what the early-warning symptoms are though I can usually tell whether I am allergic to food before I've eaten too much of it... usually..."

I saw this a few years ago on Tomorrow's World (low-brow BBC technology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned.

I watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital.

"2","Dear Netters: Maybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which can be best described as the feeling of losing gravity like that one experiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say it is not enjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme fatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts that long it makes me sweatening. Initially I called it palpitation (spelling?) until I later learnt that the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats. So is there a specific term for this feeling or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique. Thanks. Ping"

"2","I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied to about 20 schools got two interviews got one offer and am waiting to hear from the other school. Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process.  Numbers (GPA MCATs) are not everything but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities.  Of course when this happens don't expect a refund on your $50 application fee. But the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response was it an acceptance denial or wait-list?  If I assume the worst that it was a denial then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How did your interviews go? As for how long you have to wait I've called a few schools who never contacted me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I haven't heard by now I can assume a denial.  Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become fixated on the mailbox go out have fun be very proud of yourself. What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very mediocre GPA but high MCAT scores and I have been working as a software engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this: VERY IMPORTANT -------------- GPA:	3.5 or better MCAT:   top 15% in all subject MEDIUM IMPORTANCE ----------------- Writing/Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities LESS IMPORTANT -------------- College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know Anyway you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers but would like very much to understand each person as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully you were able to impress them with your character. Good luck Jeff"

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or bulgaricus culture a negative finding would not have been too informative. This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt. I guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One the L. acidophilus which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses it's major food source. Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients.  When this is done in private practice the results are rarely if ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way. This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy) where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to work yet? My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a problem with recurring yeast infections. Marty B."

There were actually some people who were more careful in their methodology who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.' One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura electromagnetic or otherwise) professor of electrical engineering at London's City University and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research named A. J. Ellison. After years of studying the method and the claims Ellison came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we calls 'Lichtenberg Figures' an effect of intermittent ionization of the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than 'not wiping off the plates' but it comes down to the same thing in the end Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and usually also tracer chemicals. kind regards todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Todd I.

"2","I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214) as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then I got pneumonia and for some reason the Lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized over time but a new doctor had me quit wait a month then switch to Mevicore. On Mevicore my total cholesterol was down to 207  LDL was 108 and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still very high around 318 and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35)  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35). He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (Just to be extra cautious though I'm sure it's not a problem.) and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of. Should the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens to folks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the above results?  Would I be better off on Lopid despite its inconvenient side effect or perhaps some other drug?  (Niacin affected my liver too)."

"2","Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems: First I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it the hernia is a relatively minor problem though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring on the other hand is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular if I'm not careful about eating slowly and thoroughly chewing food food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately the food has always managed to pass but this is annoying and causes frequent discomfort. My doctor wants to dilate the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so was it painful successful etc. Also can anyone  comment on safety advisability and success rate of this procedure? Has it become a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding perforation reaction to anesthesia). The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of extra heartbeats. In particular during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24 hrs along with a few PAC's. (Many days there are far more than this however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was normal. It certainly doesn't feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended runs of these beats one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish) thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal) and do not smoke use drugs or caffeine etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs). Also if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the same time.

"2","Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes. New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported To: National Desk Health Writer Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877 for the Huntington Medical Research Institutes. LOS ANGELES April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena Calif.  Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal Radiology. Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) a research team led by Brian D. Ross M.D. D. Phil. conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison the current standard of care in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to the patient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy. In addition to Alzheimer's disease the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias including AIDS-related dementia Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software said Dr. Ross adding this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain. Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease. Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable Dr. Ross believes to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years and consequently most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine. Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason we consider this test a major advancement in medicine said Bruce Miller M.D. a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA MRS researcher and a co-author of the study. Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats Ph.D. Truda Shonk B.S. Thomas Ernst Ph.D. and Suzanne Woolley R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon. For interviews with Dr. Ross advance copies of the Radiology May issue and other information please contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877. Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease: What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused? Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning followed by changes in personality loss of control of bodily functions and eventually death. How many people does it affect? Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death taking approximately 100000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims it is equally devastating both emotionally and financially for patients' families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset. What are its signs and symptoms? Although the cause of AD is not known two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and suggests the following criteria: -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal. -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious. -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal. -- Forgetting how to get home is serious. Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044"

Results of GUSTO Heart Attack Study to be Released Friday To: Assignment Desk Medical Writer Contact: Jim Augustine of Medical Science Communication 703-644-6824 or Steve Hull or Tracy Furey 800-477-9626 or April 29-30 202-393-2000 or 202-662-7592 (J.W. Marriott) News Advisory: Results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries trial (GUSTO) will be presented Friday April 30 at the Clinical Research Meeting. A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m. GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore blood flow to the heart a process called thrombolysis.  The thrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to break up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from recurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in a large-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected to have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide. The press conference will be held at two locations: live at the National Press Club Main Lounge 13th Floor 529 14th St. N.W. Washington D.C. and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe 145 W. 44th Street 4th Floor New York City between Broadway and 6th Avenue. GUSTO results will be presented by Eric Topol M.D. GUSTO Study Chairman professor and chairman of the Department of Cardiology at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Robert Califf M.D. clinical director GUSTO Coordinating Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center; and Allan Ross M.D. coordinator of the GUSTO Angiographic Substudy and professor and director of the Division of Cardiology at The George Washington University Medical Center. ------ Editorial Notes/Attention television: The press conference may be viewed in its entirety via satellite starting at 12:30 p.m. (EDT) C-band Telestar 302 Transponder 2V (dual audio 6.2 6.8) or KUSBS6 Transponder 8.

I'm >trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated. >Thanks. You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy. The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells and therefore it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time. Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle. The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase S synthesis of DNA occurs. The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized aagain.  In the fourth phase M (or Mitosis) the cell may divide. There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis. Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis. At any rate the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing. If what you are seeking is practical advice I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications can be given and good skincare and fluid intake are important. Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given and on the person themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this too I would love to see it and possibly some bib data. I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society. They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition if your friend has had a mastectomy I highly recommend Reach for Recovery. It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions. If you have further questions please send me E-mail.  I hav some good access to information and I enjoy trying to help other people. I wish the best to you and your friend."

[...] B >  Marty B. Marty I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article on kidney stones as gospel. First of all I would want to know who sponsored that study. I have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from local newspapers magazines to TV-guide with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy Industries. There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake. Secondly were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study didn't say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large- ly calcium. Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are in my opinion still the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention of kidney stones. I for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy the possible complications from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery. The risks of surgery anyway are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia. Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction. And the smaller the hernia is the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will become incarcerated or strangulated. =============================== Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu"

Actually severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are possible and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways however to keep the ostia open (however in a few individuals their ostia are naturally very small) and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this. The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery though. About asthma that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker in his book Sinus Survival *speculates* (and says it's not proven) that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation. Before doing any sinus surgery first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis. Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays that one should have over a given period of time because of all the environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiation is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care to comment?). Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones I don't think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery is being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments. My condolences to your friend. Marty B."

It is posted roughly every month or so by different persons and that doesn't make it any better. How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the proper methods?  Besides one can come to a conclusion without closing one's mind to other possibilities. I you don't agree with a person please ask him why he thinks like that instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice be open-minded. If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims I'll complain that it's always those neither a real believer nor a disbeliever types who narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives. -- thomas kettenring 3 dan kaiserslautern germany The extraterrestrials don't even know this planet has native inhabitants.

"2","Forgive me but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B6.  I can't seem to locate the article but I recall there was mention of some safe limits. I looked at a Balanced 100 time release formulation from Walgreen's and noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA.  Is this safe?!?. Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for? Mail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net. Thanks Leon Traister (lmtra@uts.amdahl.com)"

My personal experience and I have the same history an build you do (related to the heart that is) is that my PVC's come and go with some months causing anxiety.  Taking on more fluids seems to help and they seem worse in the summer.

But colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this treatment since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient treatments. Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much higher fees do not drive away patients. I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure.  For very little if any benefit you subject yourself to hepatitis cholera parasitic disease and even HIV. Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment? Could they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk? Food for thought. Marty B."

Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss congestion or popping in the ears you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a bulb syringe but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or may even make things worse.

"2","About two years ago I posted the following: I am planning to write a new book called Great Canadian Scientists. Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada but they must have (or have had if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists. About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting. I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness I would be pleased to hear them. In any event please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible. Please give me a name and email address phone number or mail address so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist. After I have the list I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph biographies. If you have any other ideas about this project I am interested to hear them.

Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist Personal statement from the scientist Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist What I was doing when I was 12 So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist> Experiment you can do. There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well. I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it. Hope to find one soon. I would like to again ask for more nominations especially in the pure sciences of Physics Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed. I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists and to discuss what is great what is Canadian and what is scientist.

"2","Actually I am entering vet school next year but the question is relevant for med students too. Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy histology pathology pharmacology are for the most part mass memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most med students are. Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have never applied them to large amounts of data. Has anyone had luck with any particular books memory systems or cheap software? Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an older student who returned to school this year organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success. Please no griping about how all you have to do is learn the material conceptually.  I have no problem with that it is one of my strong points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization. Thanks for your help."

"2","Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good (maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression I'm laying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have some knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post you should know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future. In article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu> lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes: > > A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on > by menopause as well as a mental break down.

If anyone > can suggest a Philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read > I'd appreciate it. Lida I can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy.  Lida I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped I tried to use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had cured her PMS using supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using B6 niacin folate and B12 to cure depression.  I'm not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was. Lida I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem.  For chemotherapy I knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C) you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become very important. Lida without your permission I'm going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover: Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids Proteins I					Proteins II Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional Status I A Clinical Perspective Evaluation of Nutritional Status II            Evaluation of Nutritional A Biochemical Perspective			Status III Homework Assignment Using the Nutritionist IV Diet and Fitness Analysis Software program Weight Control					Food Fads and Facts Age-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements	Food Additives Contaminants and Cancer Drug-Nutrient Interactions			Mineral and Water Balance Sodium Potassium and Chloride			Calcium Magnesium and Phosphorus Iron						Zinc and Copper Iodine and Fluoride				Other Trace Minerals Vitamin A					Vitamin E Vitamins D and K				Vitamin C Thiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine Pantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12 Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition Parenteral Nutrition Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have 217 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which I write myself) I've pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for educational purposes I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do). I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment Centers of America which is a private for-profit organization with hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup. For physicians reading this post I would suggest that you get the new Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the Preface of this new text: So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice. Unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the United States require no formal instruction in nutrition. But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related. ... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system. Roland L. Weinsier MD DrPH Lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals (yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act). A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status. Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti-depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression.

"2","Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some hearing problems.  It is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your own or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier :-).  You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever you may have.  If wax is old it will be harder and darker.  You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax.  Do this for a couple days then try syringing again.  It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse it out. Good Luck -heather"

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium- oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine always has been and probably always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom there is a chance that you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?). On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine.

But before I do I want to get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heart disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out.  But once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. Same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases don't use what I'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go. Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. But let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you(better yet have a mammography done on a regular basis my wife kept putting her's off both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even scheduled one but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa). One more thing I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind man this is really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan the two M.D's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want I really don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind.  That's life. Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor (GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium nicinamide(niacin) glycine cysteine and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver brewers or nutritional yeast and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF a pretty good absorption is seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2% lowest for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a fat burner.  Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one there also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to Type II diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response) intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 10(5):536(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often found in older people it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma. You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now. Here's Weinsier and Morgan advise on chromium.  They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum it will.  What then do they suggest? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug of CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day. What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then exercise that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status. When he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance.  If you can't do that I'll find a doctor who can thank you very much. Marty B."

While I was a student I had doctors remove rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple times usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason and said something like Gee you've got a lot of wax in there.  In my case removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing and I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store - I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything. One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining trapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming too.  It works but it stings like the devil so I've always been content to let any water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.

I think The Yeast Connection is > a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well > nutrition is taught anyway? Elisabeth let's set the record straight for the nth time I have not read The Yeast Connection.  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing by this hated book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book by why hate me? Elisabeth I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not hate. Candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present. Indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis.  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute it. What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: However some factors such as the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections.  I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure.  I guess that your nutrition course does not too bad. >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections as they are commonly >>called are not truely caused by yeasts.

(shudder) > Or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying? My my Elisabeth do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you noticed my faculty rank I'm a biochemist not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But as you point out it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist it's a lot of Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus go ahead and crucify me. You know Elisabeth I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what I've said that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into The Yeast Connection book because I don't know what's in that book plain and simple. And to be honest with you I'm beginning to wish that it was never written.

"2","BIOLOGICAL ALCHEMY ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION ) ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the FACT of BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS (reactions like Mg + O --> Ca Si + C --> Ca K + H --> Ca N2 --> CO etc.) as described in the BOOK Biological Transmutations by Louis Kervran [1972 Edition is BEST.] and in Chapter 17 of the book THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird 1973: (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds all of the same kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.] (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number. (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks. (4) Separately incinerate both groups. (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.] (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen hydrogen carbon nitrogen etc..] BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY even in our own bodies. Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with carbon such as horsetail extract or radishes) can SPEED HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca (much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly). Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro- organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen etc.. The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca by micro-organisms cause STONE SICKNESS in statues building bricks etc.. The reaction N2 --> CO catalysed by very hot iron creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

And to be honest >with you I'm beginning to wish that it was never written. I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the yeast connection. But I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime I'd still encourage people who have incurable chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics) to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It is an empirical approach for sure but when all else fails and your ENT says sorry you'll just have to live with it it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker) supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At this stage you have little to lose particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e. non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of course your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer?  I was just wondeing since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist. A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it. As far as pain the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line. What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system. I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care.

"2","For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can  because I feel so tired when I wake up  even more tired than I was when I went to bed  which is usually too tired to work. Anyway  I recently had a really bad flu  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway  and the three nights I used it  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is  I actually felt refreshed the next morning. So  I am now trying to look into  both in the literature and experimentally  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate  so I bought some generic tablets of that  and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. For other medical information  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia  so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that  and it didn't help  so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse  also taking vitamin supplements) Anyway  I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids  and if there are any dangers of such use (Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions).  I don't want to try BZs  because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat  and from what I hear  BZ sleep quality is not good whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff  and that also seems to lower sleep quality  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also  I would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried many of the non-pharmacological solutions)"

"2","Hi. My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep coldness and proneness to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?) tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the gland giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking any comment on the probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally' my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition may this affect the treatment development?

"2","A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do a lumbar puncture for which a CT scan is a prerequisite. I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her. To begin with they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may have a deadly disease and next thing you know you're being put into this big scary machine without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me and they responded with annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted or tried to insert an IV catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation. Is there anything I can do about these pigs ? I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help sick people and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that sort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit. Also since I named the hospital involved I should also point out that neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

"2","Robert I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med. I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just like I haven't read The Yeast Connection). Let me just start by stating that the authors of the Cold Fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation. Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food combining and life extension texts).  Robert I try to keep an open mind. But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body). Your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees I believe) you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really guessing at 600 degrees F it may actually be much higher.  The point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. Chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon?  Not in my book Robert. Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life-form.  I like reading science fiction as many people do.  But I know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to separate the fiction from the fact. Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing(and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium). Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans). For bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick. But Robert I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any better). If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems to make sense to me I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us kindred souls Robert then I guess I'll have to live with that label. For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's interesting post I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his name(like many nights I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he usesunconventional treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys? I'm going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are? How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut(if it does you may feel differently about the issue). Marty B."

People with early life hernias are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias. The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining. However the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably no higher than the general population but since you are near 40 it would be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy.

Except for ones caused by infections the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does shut down the thyroid through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary thinks that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear. The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels. Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness coldness and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart) changes in vision and coarser hair and skin among other things. I am not a doctor so I'm sure I mistated something but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body.

"2","I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein vitamin C and vitamin A prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it. Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all day for that PMS post) I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical community. Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A). When vitamin A was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C (which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite). Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic beta-carotene is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human adult liver should have 500000IU to 1000000IU of retinol stored.  We are born with 10000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that of retinol in the liver) are important then this low vitamin A reserve is not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S. The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1000 RE or 5000IU of vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4000IU of vitamin A.  Diet surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 7500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves). We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a normal vitamin A reserve(500000IU to 1000000IU).  I preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. But for vitamin A only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation of Diagnostic Test Wallach M.D. a Little Brown Series book).  This level of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach as you will see later in this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2000ug/dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain). I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for PMS studies). Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10000IU).  One other problem with beta-carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A. Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake of vitamin C you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once it's formed it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's. Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A they actually do themselves more harm than good. Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. In the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection.  For cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps DNA alteration and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process. This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene. Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa when I teach at the allopathic medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures. Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50000IU of retinol.  The serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10000 to 20000IU.  Asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels were measured 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug/dl. As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels. What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts from their book: Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth.  Protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 7.5mg(about 37000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg(100000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois (bony depositis) headaches anorexia edema and fatigue. They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25000IU in adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical lab can't run it I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25000IU per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol. Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A. Recall that the PMS papers were using 100000IU to 200000IU of vitamin A. I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25000IU for patients with a demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus. Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress I think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.

In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to weld this back in place as well. My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour. The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment. I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments. The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most interest to me: If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action? If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect afterwards. Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

(Although I've already tried >many of the non-pharmacological solutions) Well I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine and so may produce a residual hangover or drugged feeling the next morning. -- Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {imaharvardrayssdlinusm2c}!spdcc!dyer"

This is ridiculous and your doctor sounds like a nut if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic she'll need insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's dependent on insulin anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make enough she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus it's cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone but that's a _feature_ not a _bug_ and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism because her problem that her gland isn't producing enough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids so there should be no worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland. >The last couple of >monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given >some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the >'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language >but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are but the >brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)

Recently I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual to de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly I didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic) lost about 15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month) and feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from years of indulgence. Not everything that goes in comes out and personaly I don't mind giving my body a hand once in a while. Just my experience George Paap I am my beliefs. (which almost certainly are not those of my employer)"

That's why they're used. Actually I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a sugar pill. I don't know how it could be done since prescription drugs are always labeled and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the name. It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something just not for what you have.  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most common such placebo. >	3. >Getting what you pay for.

The types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are capable of responding with new hair growth this would be a very major breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin A it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad) I can't comment on your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing loss if there really is one. Marty B."

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present. I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all. The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 - one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones (estrogen for example). Naturally changing activity of the body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order. Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-) and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local library). I hope this has been of some help. -Eileen Bauer"

I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health.  It is important to exercise (11 12) and also avoid fat calories (9 10). Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle (1 2 3).  I will not bore you with the statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway. Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role in sensitizing the body's tissues to the hormone insulin. Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose weight (4). Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles (5 6).  This protein sparing effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue.  By sensitizing muscle to insulin chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they burn more fat and less muscle.  Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the fat they've lost. Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin. Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories so it's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism (4 7 8).  Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism. In summary you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy: A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories. - Eating fat makes you fat. B. Increase dietary fiber - low in calories; high in nutrients. C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week - burn calories. D. Take chromium picolinate daily - lose fat; keep muscle References: 1.  Kaats GR Fisher JA Blum K.

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine which is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die. As to taking 20-30 of these tablets that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult this would probably cause nausea vomiting abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Bob Schmieg"

Burzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against leukemia in mice with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985) Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1 and A-5 (something which he has not shown A-10 has only been extracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes: leukemia non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested. It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents) but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying peptide something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity A-10 does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy. Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory early research past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue. sdb --- sdb@ssr.com"

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it). You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example but there are probably others. Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body. The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are: 1: How does it work? 2: What evidence is there? The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I don't know about iridology but I've read a book on reflexology which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. (Always beware the words channel and energy in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.) The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive. The word licensed in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology and I suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means (Licensed herbologist) and iridologist. BTW the usual term is herbalist.

As a self-proclaimed atheist I believe that *some* conceptions of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact and I lack belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of a god is unknown inherently unknowable.

I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps. This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. Is there anything I can grow rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else. Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem to come to drink at them and I suppose that their prey will breed in them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps because as soon as the wasp season starts they stop coming to have their bath. Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps they seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about wasps is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes to no avail. They still love me and come for me even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows.

One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that could be causing difficulty with his behavior.  Standard practice would be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limiting plate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis. CPH has indeed an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However as David pointed out the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum.

Med. on the topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements and not just the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove itself to the medical community. I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out in a grant proposal that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17. Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little understanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.

"2","I posted about a pulse of (relaxation) electricity.  I now think it more like a pulse of relaxation or comfort than a pulse of electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful. Another thing.  When you sleep you lie down facing up with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you relax and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So you feel a shiver below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases and comes up to your head and the roam you hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This roam is different from the high pitch but follows the shiver of your body. Shiver is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body experience? Daniel Chung (Mr.) U.S.A."
"2","Hello all There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I would appreciate any help at all with it. My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring antidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these. So far she has been prescribed Prozac Aurorix and tryptanol all with different but unbearable side effects. The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina it was impossible to sit still for more than a minute or so. The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect all feelings were lost and the body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded over. The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- ordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was closed down. Has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next step? Thankyou in advance. Gordon Taylor E-mail: blubird@penguin.equinox.gen.nz"

I tried Prozac a few months ago and had some insomnia from it but no anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the Prozac had done any good but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a 20mg dose didn't work. Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm having is some minor GI distress but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next. My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin drugs usually Prozac.  If that works great.  If it works but has too many side effects try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work at all try one of the tricyclics like desipramine. >...suggestions as to the next step? Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much experience in this area and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe him.

Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block she asserts is another electrical effect which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners.

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortality(mumps measles. etc.). > -- How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick? > How often do they get colds flus ear infections?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care. > -- Does being sick build immunity (leading to less illness later) > does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) or does it > not have any long term effect? Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production).  In addition antibody levels tend to decline with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children. > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects? Yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support). > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal and what does one do about it? Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection. > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein vitamin C vitamin A iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A vitamin C iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin A status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good for getting general dietary advice from however. > Any data information or advice relating to this would be much > appreciated.  Thanks a lot. > > Ashwin.

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility however that these interests exist then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight. As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons the fact that the NIH didn't find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open and they credit his treatment with their survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna- tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find- ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless. gn"

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two then and have been with continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches her colds slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds. Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection and I wished that I did not give her that awful Septra.) >Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

Caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily. However I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net). That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if the child is in pain and/or high fever. >does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) or does it >not have any long term effect?

(Then you get more used to it.  Boy do I hate to see me typing this sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September I said to myself 'oh sure.'  But I do get used to it now.)

Try USP lanolin at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).

It is supposed to give you a >fast and accurate temperature reading in the ear.  How far in the ear does >one have to insert the instrument?  Is it worth the $100 it is currently >selling for? No they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently and I thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too. The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum. The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls so you have to point the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then inserting the thing snugly then pushing a button.  Unfortunately there are many things that can go wrong. It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees. I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this and she said she didn't like them either for same reasons.  She did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feels like but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office. I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button then remove the probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect that many people don't realize this and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason. In short it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks but I believe it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature."

"2","I have osteoarthritis and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes (type II I guess--no insulin). I've been trying to read up on these two conditions and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis (at least for -women- with arthritis) but of course the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain. For myself I'm almost afraid to lose weight because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories in about eight small meals) the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. Instead it drops off precipitously and then comes back on with much interest like bread on the waters. With this experience it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible. Meanwhile some experts recommend no sugar others no fat others just a balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which- parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty. Is it my imagination or are these very old conditions very poorly understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk (It's strep; give him this and he'll get well.) and so my expectations are too high? Bonita Kale"

"2","Organization: Temple University X-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.2 Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this doctor before and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I arrived somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown. They told me to undress (from the waist down to be exact) and wait for the doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood) but on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor I met him with my clothes on. First he introduced himself asked what I was there for and took a history all before I undressed. Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time? Personally I'd prefer to meet the doctor on something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If nothing else it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self conscious ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed. Does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk attitude as insensitive? Also is it unusual? James Arbuckle                          Email:  v5113e@vm.temple.edu"

Physicians seem to have a variety of thresholds for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally I think that if the patient is asymptomatic with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and PT one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient thus providing these samples for study.
