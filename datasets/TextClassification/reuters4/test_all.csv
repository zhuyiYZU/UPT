"1","Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reportedimprovements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices  disposals and currency movements  Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy  aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses  had now been completed  he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on  with strategic acquisitions taking place  from time to time   he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms  however  profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However  it would not add much to profits  with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year  this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend  with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p  approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However  he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation  beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co  which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S.  Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business  considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However  he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss  with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents."

"1","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation."

"1","The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year  and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit  President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament  Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct  compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985  he added.  But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result  we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year   he said. The price of coffee  Kenya's main source of foreign exchange  fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil  which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel  has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes  coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world  made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history  he added.  This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts  and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development   he said.  It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs   the president added."

"1","Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducingfour information technology systems that will be led by today's highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval. The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme  The New Vision of Kodak.  Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company  Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986.  If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent  that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500   it pointed out. The objective of Kodak's  new vision  communications campaign  it added  is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector. Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today -- -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes). - The Kodak KIMS system 5000  a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both. -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000  an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems. -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500  a microfilm-based  computer-assisted system which can be a starter system. Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988. Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150  14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus  Kodak pointed out  150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity. Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies  including erasable optical disks  high-density magnetic media  fiber optics and even artificial intelligence  is expected to sell in the 700 000 dlr range. Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks  each storing 2.6 gigabytes. Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives  it will sell for about 150 000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year. The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000. It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150 000 dlr range."

Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986  it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.

The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations  mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc."

Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs  partially offset by lower engine production. The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0  while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year.

The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies  cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery  which were partially offset by lower industry volumes. Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased interest costs  the company said. Despite increased competition  Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985  it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct. Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck  both manufactured in Oakville  which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986."

A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986. The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants. Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months. Those discussions are continuing  the company said  adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants  it added. Last October  Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines  Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as  distressed  under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers. Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages  benefits and work rules. Union procedures  however  require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee  membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board. The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants."

"1","Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pctof the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt  President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders. Speaking last night at a new session of congress  he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image.  Our priority is development  but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations   he said. Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.  The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year   Lusinchi said. He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had  decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case  because of the vulnerability of its economy.  Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February  1986  but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income  which dropped 40 pct last year. Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter  but that in any case it would become effective from April 1. Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement  and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support. Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation. He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela  a fundamental achievement in the new accord.  Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing   he said  adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise."

"1","The London Stock Exchange's tradedoptions market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year  and will more than double the range of options available by the end of 1988  options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain said. He told a news conference that more options contracts were traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's existence. Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts traded in February this year almost tripled to 53 056 from 19 034 in the same month last year  and further rapid growth was expected.  We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of 1988   said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index. Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc &lt;SEHL.L> from March 4  and in Plessey Co. Plc &lt;PLYL.L> from March 19. The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United States for options trading. Forty-five equity options  two currency options  two government bond (gilt) options and an option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present. Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate the London options market's leading position in Europe  especially important with French and Swiss equity options trading planned to start this year.  I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are conservative   one leading options analyst said  predicting continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least the next year. He said much of the recent growth in options had come from inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But now the retail options market was beginning to take off. The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in the equity and gilts (government bond) markets  which have encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading. Yesterday  the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to equities trading altogether  and said it expected to make a final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987. The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options market  but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the options market would need more than half of the available space."

Healthy consumer credit growth  record fee-based income  highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading  and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses  should lead to improved results in the periods ahead   chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak  reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year  reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees  and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains  Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending  particularly residential mortgages."

Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950 000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier. Howard Harlow  analyst at Whale Securities Corp  said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX  a micrographics firm  from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.  The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987  maybe as much as a dlr a share  because of DatagraphiX   Harlow said.  Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half.  Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX  Harlow said. A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX  but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986. Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX.  The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs   Harlow added. Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31  up from 301 000 dlrs or one ct a share.

Stephens replaces Jack Gill  who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern  adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31  1986  showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before  while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis  he said.  Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at.   You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing   Stephens said  in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients. He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list."
"1","Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats areprobably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October 1 this year  the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season  compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier. Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy  cotton  groundnut  sun  rape  sesame  corn  olive  coconut  palmkernel  palm  lin and castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter  fish oil  lard and tallow/greases. Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987  compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons. It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non-food purposes  it said. World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand. Oil World said it did not expect the European Community (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax  but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption."

"1","The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales isclouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast  and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers. But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges  there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts. Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers. But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp &lt;GM>  Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C>. Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels  Wall Street financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and somewhat less so on Chrysler. And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM  the industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable parts-making businesses. more &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"
"1","Soviet imports of soymeal may reach orexceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year  the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal. At least 500 000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter  with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil  it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986. The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250 000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward  it said. Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.

"1","House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support. He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget. However  he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged. There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year. Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal  but it did not include general tax increases. On trade issues  Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection.  To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide   he said. This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports  as was proposed again this year."
"1","The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 newplanes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co &lt;BA> and &lt;Airbus Industrie>  a European consortium  analysts said.  The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the manufacturers   said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and Co.  They're called walkaway leases.  AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft  which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers. AMR declined to value the deal  which analysts estimated at roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the planes  scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989  to expand its service in the Caribbean and to Europe. But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the planes  nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases. The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft  with four-year extension options  and may cancel the leases with 30 days notice by paying a small penalty  according to AMR chairman Robert Crandall.  We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms   Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals  off balance sheet  limited obligation leases  under which the financing is provided by the manufacturers. A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms.  We will own the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us   he said. Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet  long-range A300-600 planes. A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co  the unit of Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part of the deal  declined to comment on financing arrangements. Analysts said  walkaway lease  deals have been used before by airlines buying aircraft  particularly new generations of planes  but not to this extent. Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will give AMR financial stability as it grows.  AMR is using the manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and consequently  its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into the early 1990s   he said.  The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners  to reduce their exposure to risk  he added."

Justo Marin Ludena  president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports  told Reuters a harvest of up to 1 800 000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1 616 101 quintales in the year to September 1986.

Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica  whose coffee cooperative exported 59 960 quintales last year  according to the state-controlled coffee organisation. Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month  when harvesting starts.

"1","The Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential liability from insolvent savings associations  the General Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing.  We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near future   Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.  When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves  FSLIC would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end of 1986. Clearly  FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations that continue to operate   Wolf said. He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize FSLIC. Wolf said as of Septmember  1986  about 85 pct of FSLIC insured savings associations were solvent  while 15 pct were insolvent. He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable  earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three quarters of the year  while the other 20 pct of associations lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period. The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.

"1","One of General Electric Co's biggestbusinesses  aircraft engines  will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs  Wall Street analysts said. Previously  it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.  Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order   said Nicholas Heymann  analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using  rent-a-plane leases  that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons  Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery  Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm  General Electric Financial Services Inc  would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole  the deal appears to pose little risk for GE  Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625 000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith  analyst at Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company  no one order will have much of an effect on the stock.  Russell Leavitt  analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc  said the order  will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business  for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year  with well over half of the business in the military sector  according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results  he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a  unique ability  to buy a major business and reshape it  pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA  in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation  and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter  in part crediting  significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging market for such systems  sales of which are expected to reach five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line. Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to promote its new image.  We want to be to the imaging market what IBM is to the data processing market   said Edgar J. Greco  vice president and general manager of Kodak's business imaging systems division. While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in sales for 1986 came from photography products  Kodak said sales of copiers  electronic storage systems and other business products will exceed four billion dlrs this year.  We're launching a major attack on these new markets   Greco said.  Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its bread and butter   said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman. But Richard Schwarz  who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and Co  said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer photography products.

"1","The specialty retailing area continuesto pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co  once known only as a five and dime store chain  which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct. It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago. Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion. For the fourth quarter  the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs. Roy Garofalo  Woolworth vice president  told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits. He said the company now has 4 700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year  it operated 4 100 specialty stores  Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores  followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop  a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place  a discount drug  health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies  which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1 700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide  of which 1 200 are in the United States. Harold Sells  chairman and chief executive of Woolworth  said in a statement   These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings.  Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period. Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's  Woolworth opened a discount general store chain  Woolco  and J. Brannam  a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States  although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985  however  Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time  the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores."
"1","Assistant Treasury Secretary DavidMulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease their debt burden.  In my view  debt conversions or swaps into either equity or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt relief' for the debtor nations  particularly if combined with measures to encourage new equity investment and the repatriation of flight capital   he told the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions. Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to the debt problems effecting many developing countries  ranging from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions for lending.  While such approaches may have some political appeal  they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive   he said. He said debt conversions  or swaps  are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt  create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems."

"1","Canadian economic growth is expected toslow further in 1987  but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession  economists said.  The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987   said Carl Beigie  Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product  grew 3.1 pct in 1986  the fourth year of continuous expansion  but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter  GDP  in 1981 prices and at annualized rates  rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter.  Essentially it is a flat performance   said Warren Jestin  deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said  it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily  it's not a very promising number.   We weren't surprised  we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada  but we don't think there will be a recession   she added. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic  predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.  The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged   the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods  and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year."

"1","The Bank of England proposed that banksin Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets. In addition  the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage. The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified  the Bank said. The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year. In 1986  about 183 billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered  according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. Up until now  there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues. However  eurobond market participants believe the Bank of England is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk. Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of England is reluctant to inhibit competition  it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently.  The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned...   the Bank's proposal said. Once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter  the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60 pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of capital. The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of 28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After that  any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value. The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities  revolving credits or commercial paper  the Bank said. The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper  which called for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned final discussion in Parliament  scheduled before summer. The new Banking Bill  updating the 1979 Banking Act  is the third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the supervision of financial institutions. It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act  aimed to bolster investor protection  and the Building Societies Act  which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks. The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal controls  making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors. Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their capital  and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10 and 25 pct of capital  were not under debate  the paper showed. However  preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed  it said. Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case-by-case basis rather than along general lines. Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies  the paper showed. They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities  and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks. Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed  the paper showed. Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case-by-case basis under new proposals  it said. The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees. It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department would probably not qualify for such treatment. On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank  an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases. But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur  and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's balance sheet to meet precise group objectives  the paper said. On collateral security  it said this  should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base.   The presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of 25 pct  but only in the most exceptional circumstances and even then to a very limited extent   it said."

Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for consultations later this week. He said they will then return to Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact. Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces (INF) separate from strategic and space weapons  Reagan said:  This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF reductions.   To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text at Geneva tomoorrow   Reagan said. He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles   none is more important than verification ... Any agreement must be effectively verifiable.  The United States has been working closely with allies and friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual elimination  the president said. He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in Reykjavik  Iceland  which was shelved when the Soviet leader insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.

"1","Soviet winter grains could be off toa faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter  weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point  but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems  analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans  analysts of the Soviet Union said.  From a weather standpoint  you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)   Gail Martell  chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops  Martell and other analysts said.  Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us   an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years  the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring  Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops  but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter  however  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent  so the bulk of winterkill  analysts speculate  likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.  Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness   Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine  and below normal over the entire winter crop area  she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill  Jim Candor  senior forecaster for Accu Weather  said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter  analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures  the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding  they said.  The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now   a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions  more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies  he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market  weather analysts said.  A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half   Martell said."

"1","The U.S. is sticking for the momentto its policy that Brazil  which two weeks ago suspended debt payments to private banks  should deal with its creditors and not with governments  U.S. officials said.  I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to do   a senior administration official stated.  Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point   said another official following an assessment of that country's latest debt crisis. The official  who asked that his name not be used  said the National Security Council  the Treasury and State departments and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation. In a related development  small regional banks that have made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American countries  will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker here tomorrow. Brazil  with about 108 billion dlrs in debt  shocked banks late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems. Brazil's trade surplus  its main source of foreign exchange has dwindled in recent months  making it difficult to service its debt. The official said the interagency meeting was called to discuss  the general debt situation and compare notes on (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro.  Funaro  who told reporters here that he wanted a political discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from official sources  held discussions here on Friday with Volcker  Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials. Another senior administration official said he was perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis with governments and not with creditor banks  at a time when Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.  We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems bizarre  just bizarre   the official said. One official today described Funaro's argument as  nonsense   and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil  for which that country was in arrears. Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but wanted to avoid a confrontation. The consensus among administration officials seems to be that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic economic problems.  Brazil is a special case  but there's no doubt they would not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their economic policy   a senior official added. Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at the Fed's suggestion.  Since they are the hosts  we feel it's up to them if they want to say something   one regional bank official said. But other banking sources said that regional banks  many of which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America  are dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank  in the refinancing of foreign debts. The sources added that Volcker  for his part  is dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors  and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve role in the rescheduling process."

"1","Total supply of frozen concentratedorange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels  even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season  the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report  the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ  mostly from Brazil  have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision  scheduled for April 22  on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier  but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies  apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87  supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago  it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved  and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened  the department said."
"1","House Ways and Means Committeechairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for any tax increase  including a tax on securities transactions  before considering the issue  a staff member said. In addition  congressional leaders have not agreed on whether they will seek any tax increase this year  he said. Rostenkowski  an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in charge of tax legislation  met this afternoon with House Speaker Jim Wright  a Texas Democrat  to discuss a variety of tax and budget issues  an aide said. He added that Wright did not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday as a possible way to cut the federal deficit. The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax. However  he said Wright had not recommended it as he had another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place. Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17 billion dlrs a year  the aide said. The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is  strongly opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities transactions.  NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement   Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide and would be counter-productive  making America's securities industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time when financial markets are becoming increasingly international."

"1","Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash  the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985  it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs  respectively  USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate  or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel  based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate. Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel  based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate. The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law  the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates  the department said. The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices  it said."
"1","Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtkesaid the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc &lt;TX> to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and that a settlement was  in the best interests of both companies.  Liedtke  in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders  said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling the case.  Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals  both before and after trial  to settle this dispute   Liedtke said in the letter.  We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make such clearly untrue statements.  Last month  a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded to Pennzoil  but interest accruing on the award has pushed the total amount back above 10 billion dlrs. Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.  Other than to put on the record that it has made offers  Texaco's proposals make no sense   Liedtke said in the letter.  In fact  two of Texaco's offers were identical and were proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not accept.  The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made by either Pennzoil or Texaco.  If and when Texaco's management changes its position and demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to settle this matter  Pennzoil will make every effort to cooperate   Liedtke said.  Such a solution  I believe  is clearly in the interests of both companies  even if it not attractive  as a personal matter  to Texaco's management and directors.  Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and profits from those assets that have since been sold  approximately equaled  Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion dlrs for Getty."

"1","Hilton Hotels Corp said it receivedapproval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks. That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation  set up by the late Conrad Hilton  to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp  worth approximately 164 mln dlrs  according to Hilton attorneys. Barron Hilton  Conrad's son  is making a bid to purchase those 6 782 000 shares  the company said. However  in an effort to hold onto the stock  the Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to a public support organization  freeing it from the constraints of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969  according to the Hilton Corp. That act said that a private foundation could not own more than 20 pct of a corporation  lawyers explained. Anything over that figure had to be sold. The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died  the law required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of the common stock should be sold.

"1","The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board  AWB  about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop  the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains  the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price  it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price  GMP  calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years  the department said. In addition  deductions for taxes  freight  handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics  BAE  predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports  the department said."

"1","ITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told ameeting of analysts that the company has been considering a repurchase of some shares.  We are considering that as a very important way to increase earnings per share   Araskog said and noted the aim was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market. ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share a year ago. Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares being studied for repurchase.  We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988   Araskog told the analysts.  We have more confidence...than any other time in our history - at least with me.  Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s. Last year  the company transferred its European telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie Generale d'Electricite  called Alcatel N.V. ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture. Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year  Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small companies was recently concluded.  We really wrapped everything up   he said adding that the company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock transfers. Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany receiveables  which should be paid by the end of March. Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was considering repurchasing some shares  but a spokesman noted that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of the sharp appreciation in its stock price.  Breaking out operating earnings by divisions  ITT said diversified services  which consists of insurance  financial services  communications and hotels  saw the sharpest rise in operating income  to 454 mln dlrs  from 297 mln dlrs a year ago. Industrial and defense operating income declined 48 mln dlrs  to 315 mln dlrs  while natural resources increased 10 mln dlrs  to 73 mln dlrs  the company said."

"1","Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings  prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage  but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal  traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans  even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop  means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized  traders said. Here too  acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats  due to the more attractive deal from the government  they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago  which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans  which are easier to grow  one commercial trader said."

"1","Wall Street analysts said a sharerepurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.  He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger  said analyst Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co.  There was a firestorm of criticism from people on the institutional side.  Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the shares in the near term but some had reservations about the long term effects of the plan.  They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by the buyout of Ross Perot   said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional investors. He said the plan  which could cost more than five billion dlrs over four years  was similar in size to Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis than that of Chrysler Corp &lt;C>. Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy back stock on a large scale. The General Motors plan  announced after a board of directors meeting in New York  calls for repurchase of up to 20 pct of the common stock by the end of 1990. The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln class E &lt;GME> and class H &lt;GMH> shares. GM shares closed at 75-5/8  up 7/8  in composite trading prior to the company's announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co  which trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours  said it was making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.  The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow   said Ronald Glantz  analyst at Montgomery Securities.  I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming from unless they borrow   Glantz said.  Their credit rating is going to fall.  GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending. Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has 37 000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs  this will be seen as rubbing salt into the wound   Glantz said.  GM must be challenging the union to make it the strike target.  Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think the overall plan was  prudent.   Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in the stock tomorrow   Hutton's Phillippi said. He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels  they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the confines of their cash flow.  Phillippi  who has been telling clients to hold GM shares mainly for income  said on balance  we've got to feel they're doing something constructive."

Operating earnings  however  were off about four pct  and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit  which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market.  It is in a soft market now  but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share   Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall  who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference  said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted  however  the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation.  I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts   Beall said  adding   long-term  we have a very serious problem.

"1","President Reagan  seeking to salvagehis Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal  said a major U.S. economic program for the region was working but needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned. In a report to Congress  he called for immediate approval of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992. The report  mandated by Congress  explains how the administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission  which in 1984 developed a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels. The commission  headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.  The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat   Reagan said. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams  who briefed reporters  said the administration will not try to link approval of military aid for the rebels  known as contras  with the vastly more popular economic package for the region  as some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested. He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra scandal  Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr allotment in military aid for the rebels  who are fighting Managua's leftist Sandinista government. Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest fight in the Democratic-controlled House  but said he believed a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time in six years -- would back the military request."

"1","The International Swap DealersAssociation has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions  said Thomas Jasper  the Association's co-chairman. The contract  unveiled at a press conference   is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient  he said.  The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation   Japsper said. Privately  eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers  usually acting through a bank middleman  agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. Usually  the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman  usually a bank  takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick  a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc  said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a  level playing field  be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice  the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules. He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. That code should be completed within the next few weeks  he said."

Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue will be 9.66 pct.  The launch of the new certificate has to be viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate issues   the Treasury said. The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and variable-rate investments."

"1","Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowingto 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986  and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments  the Governor of the Bank of Greece  Dimitris Halikias  said. He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs  but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost. Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986  up from 15.2 billion at end-1985  Halikias said. He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures. He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October  1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985. Halikias said he was  fairly optimistic  Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year. He said domestic demand has fallen  reducing the need for imports  while Greek exports are becoming more competitive. Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period  while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion."

"1","&lt;British ColumbiaResources Investment Corp>  earlier reporting higher full year operating losses  said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances  with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However  payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account  B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31  1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders  with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31  the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout  future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co &lt;WTC>  B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss  which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss  the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985  and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs."

"1","Venezuela plans to have a public sectorforeign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term  public finances director Jorge Marcano said. He said the target  which compares with around 24.5 billion dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983  is considered a manageable amount which will assist in development plans. The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8 pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct. In an interview with El Universal newspaper  Marcano said he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision to suspend interest payments.  I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the U.S. Government  which urged several major banks to soften their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil announcement came later   he said. Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile  objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact with Chile  with a one pct spread  came a day before Venezuela's. Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans  which are aimed at aluminium  steel and iron ore projects.  We cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new agreement and present the financing programmes we have   he said  adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s. Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign borrowing  which would come from banks and multilateral agencies  to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next two years. According to the restructured accord  this would work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs."

"1","Public Service Co of NewMexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln dlrs. The utility said it advised a customer task force this is one restructuring alternative being considered for the company's electric business. The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's overall initiative in response to several goals announced by New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers  it explained. Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its reorganization concept would be to separate the company's electric utility operation into independent generation and distribution entities  creating the opportunity for a targeted 35 mln dlr a year rate decrease. Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a variety of businesses recently  the company said it believes  the concept may well have an application in the utility business and intend to investigate it fully.  The generation company would provide projected power needs of the distribution entity under a 30-year  power security agreement  which would have a federally regulated rate structure  the company said. Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986. This holding company would be the general partner of the limited partnership  the company said. The company said its limited partnership concept was presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov. Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals. It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an alternative structure that would  help reduce rates through a lower overall cost of capital. Last month the governor said  I have outlined to PNM critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may administration in achieving  adding the goals include immediate rate reduction  stabilization of future rates and stimulation of business expansion. The company told the task force the new distribution company  under the limited partnership alternative or otherwise  would continue to be fully regulated by state regulators. PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and transmission services. The generation company would have no retail customers. PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan with state regulators in the near future  noting approval would also be needed by FERC."

The bonds started trading this morning at 20 stg pct. Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand throughout the day  prompted mainly by sterling strength.

The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it was announced and dealers said that even first thing this morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable existing stocks. However  sterling's continuing firm performance had prompted interest in the tap right at the outset. The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid structure  which not only enabled investors to defer payment of the major part of the price until April 27  but also conferred a substantial gearing element. This meant  dealers explained  that investors who bought the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the market in general  although only 20 stg pct of the total purchase price was tied up initially."

"1","A leaf disease affecting seven pct ofSri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices  industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2 900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus  corenes pora  which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143 000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133 000 and 135 000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken.  The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease   an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka  east of here  to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145 600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December.  If there is a shortage of rubber  prices are bound to rise   a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices  particularly crepe  fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo  averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.  Some factors  like less storage space from excess stocks  meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had   one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month  while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas.  If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed  we would have further shortages   one official said.  But this again could benefit prices   a buyer said."

"1","The Geneva Motor Show  the first majorcar show of the year  opens tomorrow with U.S. Car makers hoping to make new inroads into European markets due to the cheap dollar  automobile executives said. Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and General Motors Corp &lt;GM> sell cars in Europe  where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM also makes a few thousand in North American plants for European export. Now Chrysler Corp &lt;C> is saying it will begin exporting American-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe  a market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy. Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last year -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European market. Opel/Vauxhall  with factories in West Germany  Spain and Britain  accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about 1.3 million vehicles in 1986  officials said. James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped for a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made vehicles in Europe  selling between 7 000 and 8 000 (North American-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987.  A low dollar makes our prices very attractive   he told Reuters. Using an average price of 13 000 dlrs per car  his projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million and 104 mln dlrs in turnover  Fry added. That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1 500 North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs. Ford has 41 factories in West Europe  which manufacture all of its cars sold on the continent.  But Walter Hayes  vice president of Ford Europe  told Reuters he did not expect a large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar.  We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe is inevitably a small volume market.  Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to European environmental specifications cut into profit margins. But Robert Lutz  Chrysler executive vice-president  said the weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe.  After a lapse of almost nine years  Chrysler is about to re-enter the European market   he said.  We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar."
"1","The Bundesbank is planning changes inthe system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument  central bank officials said. Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently  enabling the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses  to steer money market liquidity more flexibly. The changes will probably come into force in April. Under the current system  banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank for subsequent repurchase  a time consuming business. Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks  which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level. Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the Hesse LZB  which covers the Frankfurt area. The change to come into force next month will allow the Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself  in a process legally comparable to direct debiting. At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on Monday  holds the tender late on Tuesday morning  announces the result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday. The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28 days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary. For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow (Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt yesterday (Tuesday). Central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical  with no direct implications for interest rates.  It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter   said an official at the Hesse LZB. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago  and praised their flexibility. The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible  banking economists said. By speeding up the tender process  they will make it possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month  something long sought by banks  to respond to changing money market conditions.  With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be refined  but there won't be any effect on interest rates   said Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger. The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments  but by steering liquidity  not interest rates  he said."

The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987  but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987. Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier. The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17 dlrs per barrel."

"1","The Federal Reserve Board votedunanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps  forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously  the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset  which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore  for example  the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks  which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However  the staff concluded   The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations.  The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market  on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules."

"1","National Fuel Gas Co said it hasproposed a plan of reorganization for &lt;Argo Petroleum Corp>. The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources Corp subsidiary to receive 75 pct of Argo's principal producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing Argo's debt to Seneca. The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500 000 dlr advance to Argo  National Fuel Gas said. National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a term sheet signed by Seneca  Argo and representatives of Argo's unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs. National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would allow it to capitalize  together with other assets  a new company for its existing shareholders. National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing secured debt to be refinanced in an 8 875 000 dlr refinancing note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas properties. Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly owned properties. In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's existing debt  Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the venture's development costs  National Fuel Gas said. It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange for their claims against the company."

"1","The Bank of England and the U.S. FederalReserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets  the Bank of England said. The plan  covering swaps  forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates  complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy  the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.  On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.  At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets  the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct  depending on the quality of the counterparty  the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract  the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would  however  be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or  in the U.S.  By domestic national government agencies  the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to  net  contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that  such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation   and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

"1","International BusinessMachines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light into electrical signals that translate into computer language. IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second. The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits. IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient in turning light signals into electrical signals  it seems to be an ideal material for the light-based computer communications expected to be widely used in the future. The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector and transistor circuitry close together. Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and distortion  it said."

"1","Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday  trade sources said. Sunflower  maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected  they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize  sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires  with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors  between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba  15 and 120 mm in La Pampa  10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe  10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios  five and 40 mm in Misiones  and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes  Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe  though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area  compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares  or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes  or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates  or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume  according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest  down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes  which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area  which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes  or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production  by contrast  is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes  which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes  according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition  helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares  up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares."

Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8 to 31-1/2 Tuesday. A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has 4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go for control of the whole company. An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the rumor. The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up to 40 dlrs a share  or for a total of 680 mln dlrs. A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available. Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership. Wayne Jones  vice president at Outboard for strategic planning  said management wants to stay independent.  We are not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our strategic plans   he said. That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs. An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a  decent  price for outboard.

"1","The Canadian Wheat Board has advisedthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat  oats  and barley in the crop year beginning August 1  a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers.  They're all lower   he said.  This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.  Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board  which markets most of Canada's grain  obtains higher than expected prices on world markets  the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower  the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices  usually made in April  rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts. But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year."

"1","General Motors Corp staged an explosiverally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday  but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.  I'm very positive on GM   said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co.  They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value.  However  some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday  GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares  with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning  and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive.  The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet   he said  since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76  he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988  compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates  which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts  Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987.  On balance  GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors   he said. In late February  GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January  adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall  GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986  analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter  which will help GM finance the buyback.  GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds   he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today  in part in reaction to the announced buyback  and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988.  The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler   he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend  currently five dlrs a share annually  which gives it a higher yield than its competitors  Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year  he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken  and GM's new products  if successful  will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share.  I believe their new cars will be successful  but that will only curtail losses in market share   which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990  Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock  he said results will not improve until 1988.  I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM   he said. Fricke  who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs  said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results.  But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important."

"1","Healthy growth in corporate profits and inconsumer spending  the two pillars on which Japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth  both look rotten at the core  economists polled by Reuters said. Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth  they said. Falling profits may lead to falling incomes  which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits. The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily. However  this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices  and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports.  No clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced   the central bank said. Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow  even though Japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct  giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer. Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors. The economists  however  believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad  already fierce domestic competition will increase  fueled by lower-priced imports. Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer. A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves. Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector  almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance  said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara. Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations  reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers)  holding down wages  and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now. Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales. But reduced bonuses  and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging. Twice a year  bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings  encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza. To save funds  some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus  forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods. Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary  a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness  education  and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary. The last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age. Faced with such a vicious circle  the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited. The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less than excited at the results. Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited. The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further  with the basic bank savings rate at only 0.25 pct  Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said. Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit  official figures show. Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment. The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity. Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price inflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition."

"1","French oil group Total Cie Francaise desPetroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss  including minority interests  for 1986  after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs  the company said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation  turning a consolidated net profit  before losses on stocks  of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud  president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>  told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year  taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations  was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln  due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations   Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6 000 this year and 5 000 in 1988 from 6 800 last year  under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs  he said.

"1","Texas Railroad Commissioner JamesNugent  saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act  today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production  expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil  should also be exempted from the severance tax  Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years  or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel.  We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough   Nugent said.  In other words  let's tell Washington to either lead  follow  or get out of the way.  Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry."

Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services  Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.  (Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so   he said.  I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business.  However  Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations  saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies. He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas  it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks.  We do not have anything actively under consideration   he said."
"1","The Senate Banking Committee hasissued a revised draft bank regulation bill which would permit so-called non-bank banks to continue all their activities in progress as of March 5  1987. The bill  which the committee is scheduled to consider tomorrow  would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new activities after March 5  increase the number of their locations or cross-market products or services not permissible for bank holding companies. The bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank securities or insurance activities. The bill would establish a financing corporation to raise 7.5 billion dlrs for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and give federal regulators more power to arrange out-of-state mergers for failed or failing banks with 500 mln dlrs or more in assets. Committee chairman William Proxmire  D-Wis  had wanted to ban all non-bank bank activities started after July 1  1983  but opposition from other committee members forced him to revise the legislation. The House Banking committee is also considering bank regulation legislation  but is waiting for the Senate to act."

"1","U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are askingbanks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry  swap dealers said. After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board  dealers said that in effect  regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets  which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist  dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately  the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick  co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc  said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals.  What they are proposing is really double counting   Patrick de Saint-Aignan  managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co  said. Instead  he argues  banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.  The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected   said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.  What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now   he added.(Adds title first paragraph). Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement  such as those based in Japan  will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. Indeed  regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger  following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed  said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting  that is  offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. The paper said that regulatory authorities  recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk.  Furthermore  the paper said  if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests  it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.  One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court   said one bank official."
"1","Former White House spokesman LarrySpeakes said he and President Reagan misled the public unintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because they themselves were misled by others. In a televised interview  Speakes was contrasting the defensive  much-criticized efforts Reagan made in early attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he expected when the president addressed the nation tonight.  When we went into those press conferences and that nationwide address in November right after the (Iran) story broke  the president did not have the proper information   Speakes said.  And that's why we were misled. And consequently  the president and I misled the public  to a certain extent.   We were badly served by the people that were involved in the Iranian crisis and running the show.  Asked whom he meant  Speakes said former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter; and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North. Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of events  that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts ...  McFarlane has said that he  North and Poindexter had doctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimize Reagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as part of an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 news conference."
"1","The Canadian government's reducedborrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make  aggressive use  of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of financing in 1986  the central bank said in its annual report. The report  authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey  also noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in January  1986  and that the country's economy performed unevenly while inflation remained a major concern. Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more  lessen the reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly more through short term treasury bill financings.  The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs   said Bouey who was replaced by deputy governor John Crow last month. The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was 69.7 billion dlrs  an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984. The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing requirements  a run down in Ottawa's cash balances  and generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange transactions. Also in pursuit of shorter term financing  the bank made greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to five year maturities  Bouey said. Bouey said payments to chartered banks  which are made to banks that are facing liquidity problems  dropped to an average of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion dlrs in March  1986. The advances were made largely to four banks  Canadian Commercial Bank  Northland Bank  Continental Bank of Canada and the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been liquidated  which enabled partial repayment of advances  and the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the advances."

"1","Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME directors have postponed action on a membership petition calling for a ban on dual trading  CME Chairman Jack Sandner told Reuters. Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular board meeting today  but directors first wanted the opinions of a special committee that has been studying trading conditions in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six months.  We didn't want to preempt the committee   Sandner said. Instead  Sandner said the board will wait for the findings of the special S and P committee  which is considering some type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures. Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity for traders to  front-run  or trade their own accounts at more favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner said he expects the special committee to report its findings late next week and the board to act when those findings are presented. In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a ban on dual trading  Sandner pointed out that the board already unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P 500 futures at a prior meeting. The change was withheld  however  at the request of the special committee after a study was released and the committee felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively  Sandner said. Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on dual trading and  the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to a ban on dual trading.  Last week  CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500 futures and options on futures. In addition to the dual trading issue  the committee is also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P trading pit  Melamed said. Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special committee is appointed  recommendations from the committee are usually approved by the exchange board of directors."

The current agreement expires on Sept 30  1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975.

We have had a second agreement  but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices   Melnikov said.  I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30  1988   he said.

"1","Whether the Soviet Union will fulfillits buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States  a Soviet trade official told Reuters.  How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?  said Albert Melnikov  deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.  We are in the market for grains  but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices   he said in an interview. Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices.  We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault   Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that  purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.   The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?  he said. The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn  which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes  but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive  the Soviets will buy more if they need it. Wheat buying  however  is a different story  Melnikov said.  If the United States is interested in selling its wheat  then they must offer competitive prices  and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered   he said. Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy  Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer  U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels."

"1","Key tax and budget lawmakersWednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new securities tax  which has has aroused concern on Wall Street and put pressure on brokerage stocks. Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target of 108 billion dlrs  House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues. The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5 percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year. Rostenkowski  the chief taxwriter  considers it too early to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by congressional tax analysts  a spokesman said. The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan maintains his staunch opposition.  First we've got to decide whether to raise additional revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early   Rostenkowski said in a statement. He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting Tuesday  and in fact was not asked for one  a House source said. The idea was presented only as something that might or might not be valuable  he said. House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was another option to be looked at  if Congress decided it needed to raise revenues to reduce the deficit  an aide said. The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend specific tax proposals  the aide said. The Budget Committee will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in 1988  but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision on how the taxes will be raised. The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target. But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment  and there were uncertainties about the details of the tax. Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no decisions are anticipated  congressional sources said. At the same time  without President Reagan's assent to a general tax increase  they are left with piecemeal taxes that are guaranteed to anger those who must pay.  We could just do all of them   one congressional source said of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes  securities taxes  oil import fee and others."

We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill   said Dean Kleckner  president.  The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation.  Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced   Kleckner said. The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market. A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate. The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather."

Redstone  63  catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.  We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems  Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said  Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals.  Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom  four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend.  Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel   Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs.

But he said it is possible to reach agreement on a new contract to save the jobs of UAW members at AMC's Wisconsin operations despite the impasse. AMC has said it will resume talks  but only for 24 hours to ascertain whether the union was willing to agree to the concessions it wants.

Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from discussions with Dome's lenders  spokesman David Annesley told Reuters in response to an inquiry. Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3 billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30  1987  when it hopes to implement the debt plan now under negotiation. Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following release of the plan to lenders. Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle from creditors prior to June 30. The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with cash flow generated by assets backing the loans. Annesley also said there was no change in the status of legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt. Together  the noteholders are owed about 520 000 Swiss francs  and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss franc denominated debt in default.

"1","Trans World Airlines Inc complicatedthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or  alternatively  to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today  and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont  but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena.  We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else   said one arbitrager.  We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon.  Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir  but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements.  They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer   said Timothy Pettee  a Bear Stearns analyst.  I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals   said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment  and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont  which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8  also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment  but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.  Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines   said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.  I don't know whose going to buy them  but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package   said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt  in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc  because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns.  It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement   said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA  which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont  dominant in the southeast  to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share."

"1","The failure of talks to introducenew coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement  ICA  was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota  as had been proposed  President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said. He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.  Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year   Calmon added. Calmon said  assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota  Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags  of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln  leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.  It's a pity the talks broke down  but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction   he added. In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee  including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags. Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags  of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags  he added. The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags  although many traders believe it was higher than this."

"1","Sales of new cars by the U.S. autoindustry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of a year ago  but industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> was an exception with an eight pct drop. The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry from weak mid-February sales  but the eight domestic-based car manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month from last year. GM  whose sales have been weakening for several months  took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28 period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago  when sales for the entire industry were depressed from the ending of major marketing incentive campaigns. At the same time  rival Ford Motor Co &lt;F> said its car sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> was up 11.3 pct. The industry leader's slide was even more marked for the full month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February  including imports  compared with 43.5 pct a year ago. Industry analysts said the 198 818 domestic-make cars sold in the seven selling days of late February represented a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the 556 953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate. Last year  the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars  including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in 1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December  a lack of widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather  analysts said. GM sales vice-president C.N.  Bud  Moore said in a statement that his company's sales  began their recovery from the low point reached in January  and we expect the improvement to continue in coming months.

"1","Allis-Chalmers Corp said it askedlenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock. The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business  make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds. Under the plan  which was presented to institutional lenders  the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp   substantial amounts  of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company. Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a  resulting dilution of the existing common stock   Allis-Chalmers said in a statement. Under the plan  holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common. Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors  common and preferred holders and present and former employees. Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing  appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached.  The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring.  It is too early to talk about a charge  because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions  he said. Also under the plan  payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met. Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made  at substantially reduced levels.  Allis-Chalmers  once one of the leading farm equipment companies  sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs  leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks  air conditioning  fluids handling and solid materials processing. Last year  Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus  Ohio. Under the restructuring plan  Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing  which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction  accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs. The company will also sell its fluids handling operations  which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues. Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs  or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985  the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs  or 12.27 dlrs a share. The company's last profit was in 1980  when it earned 52.4 mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs."

Subcommittee chairman John Dingell  D-Mich  said he did not understand why the Defense Department had taken no action against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it had substantially overcharged the government for military aircraft parts.  In 1984  TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books and other problems in one of the company's divisions in Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of the federal government on various military aircraft parts   Dingell said.  For example  by falsifying its books and records  TRW inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial engine blade   Dingell said in a statement. Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against TRW last year charging the company with overcharging the government. The Justice Department later joined the suit.  While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW  I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management  many flagrant and obvious violations of law  company policy and ethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's (1984) report to the government   he said."
"1","The U.S. Army has delayed plans tobuy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S. ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters  Defense Department officials said. The Army has been considering buying some British Rapier missiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gap partial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. York Division Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985. Despite recent indications by the service that it intended to buy the missiles soon  defense officials told Reuters a final decision had been suspended because some Army officials favored a more versatile gun-missile combination. The gun-missile combination would open the competition wide to U.S. firms.  The missile option is on hold now and no decision has been made   said one of the Pentagon official  who asked not to be identified.  There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an integrated system of our own   said another official. Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab said  however  that Ronald and Rapier  are not out of the picture by a long shot.  There has been strong sentiment in the Army to reject a missile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gun and missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle. Such a move would throw the competition wide open to U.S. firms  including General Electric Co &lt;GE>  Boeing Co &lt;BA>  FMC Corp &lt;FMC> and Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML>. But some Pentagon officials have expressed fears that an  off-the-shelf  gun-missile combination could not be fielded quickly enough. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger canceled the Sgt. York gun  made by Ford Motor Co &lt;F> Aerospace and Communications Corp  after the Pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs on the system and then decided it could not shoot down attack helicopters at the proper range. The Army later expanded the division air defense concept  announcing it would divide the system into five different components for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billion dlrs  including a missile and gun-system combination on a tracked vehicle."

"1","Trading in energy futures on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next five to 10 years as the market matures  according to outgoing chairman Michel Marks.  Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous period of transition that will last five to 10 years   Marks said  adding that volume will soar  international participation will increase  and activity of producing countries  major oil companies  and speculators will grow. Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.  The priority of the next 10 years is operational efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product development   said Marks. Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX  which is running out of trading space  to process greater volumes expeditiously in order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that are already planned. Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by the end of the decade to 250 000 contracts daily and combined products volume could soar to  100 000 contracts a day. Much of the increased activity will come from the international sector  according to Marks.  That's a huge growth area   he said  adding that it will run the gamut from foreign producer countries to foreign independent operators. He said it would be difficult to develop a futures contract based on an internationally traded crude although he previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.  Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task  he said. Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on an international product rather than an international crude will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract. Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the major oil companies  which already trade on the NYMEX  and institutional funds such as investment houses  pension funds  and insurance companies  Marks said.  The commodities markets have become financial markets and should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries   Marks said. He said speculators will increase their share of the energy futures markets in the coming years from the current  share of about 30 pct. Hedgers  as a result  will lose some of their 70 pct share."

"1","The Securities Industry Associationendorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for commercial banks. Robert Gerard  managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co  told reporters his group  which mainly represents investment banking firms  supported committee members who want the Federal Reserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bank holding companies seeking new powers.  The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance pending congressional review   Gerard said. The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan associations and prohibit new nonbank banks. Gerard said the securities association had no position on nonbank banks. The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensive study before changing the Glass-Steagall Act  which separates commercial and investment banking activities  Gerard said. Until the study is completed  the Fed should not act on the applications by Citicorp  J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities  he said. The study was likely to show substantial benefits from continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking  he said. Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker Jim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds that invest in securities.  It may reduce the volume of activity  but the tax is a tax on the saver and investor   Gerard said. In addition  a U.S. tax would drive business from the United States to other countries  he said."

Rau said Exchange National Bank has concentrated its resources on financial services for medium-sized Chicago and Midwest businesses  asset-based lending to middle-market companies  and sales and trading of financial services.  Most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost consumer deposits for their income. We decided to move our franchise into a less susceptible niche   Rau said.  Nichemanship is a very difficult thing  especially in urban areas where inevitably banking franchises are mass-market oriented   Rau said.  The odds are against other banks doing what we have done.

"1","The rally Wednesday in U.S. interestrate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a three month trading range which signals a bullish chart breakout  financial analysts said. In addition  sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs  the analysts said.  The market is paying more attention to the weakened state of the economy right now   said Refco analyst Mike Connery. Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth will be slow. Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production figures also provided some support.  The domestic economies of the major trading partners of the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be forced to ease   thus paving the way for a more accomodative U.S. credit policy  added John Michael  analyst at First Options of Chicago. Michael pointed out  however  that trimming the U.S. trade deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.  The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather than translate those into their own currencies and suffer exchange rate risk  they buy dollar-denominated instruments   Michael said. Indeed  futures traders with cash bond connections said some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from buying by Japanese interests. But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.  The breakout is pretty important   said chartist Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston.  Not only did bonds close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways pattern we've been in for the last three months.  Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32  and that the rally occurred on heavy volume  Keefe said. Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore   we still have the April (1986) highs to contend with   which in the nearby contract is 105-15/32. Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June T-bonds and  there is an outside chance to reach 106.  Keefe warned  however  that confirmation also is needed from other technical indicators such as relative strength indexes and short-term momentum indicators.  Without them  sustained strength is in question   Keefe said."

"1","President Reagan  fighting to regainpublic confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal  admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an arms-for-hostages deal and   It was a mistake.   When it came to managing the NSC (National Security Council) staff  let's face it  my style didn't match its previous track record   Reagan said in a television address to the American people.  I have already begun correcting this   he added in his prepared remarks. Reagan's speech  widely regarded as critical to his hopes of repairing his presidency  was his first detailed response to last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed contra rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he waited for the truth to come out and admitted   I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence.  He said that a few months ago  he told the American people he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert operation.  My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true  but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not   Reagan said.  There are reasons why it happened  but no excuses. It was a mistake   he said. Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government.  It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.  I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan   he said. The commission  headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower  said Reagan's  intense compassion  for Americans being held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy. It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide-ranging  probably illegal activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff  which hatched the operation. Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's recommendations about the running of the NSC  adding   In fact  I'm going beyond its recommendations  so as to put the house in even better order.  He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress   especially on foreign and national security policies.  He said his new national security adviser  Frank Carlucci  was rebuilding the national security staff  with proper management discipline.  Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now consisted of new people. He said that FBI Director William Webster  his new nominee to head the CIA   understands the meaning of 'rule of law' . Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board  which acts as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities. But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations --  No ifs  ands  or buts.  Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong defense of his Iran policy. In a televised speech last November 13  Reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on terrorism  utterly false.  As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union speech  Reagan said that  serious mistakes were made  but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals. By contrast  tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat  confident demeanor. He said he took full responsibility for his own actions  and for those of my administration.   As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge  I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me  I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior   Reagan said. Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress  from allies around the world --  and if we're reading the signals right  even from the Soviets.  His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe."
"1","President Reagan said improperrecord keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran arms initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved arms shipments by Israel before or after the fact. In a televised address to the American people Reagan said he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a complaint made by the Tower commission. The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel.  I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when   Reagan said. Reagan added:  Rest assured  there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House).  The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated various laws  including the Arms Export Control Act."

Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms  including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>  he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2 200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi  which would complete production.  We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future   Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs  with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company  which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder  still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery.  We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification   he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460 000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year  compared with 11 ships of 462 000 dwt in 1985/86  he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage  but the outlook for ship repairing was bright."

"1","A group of creditor banks hopes to workout a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd &lt;JLIT.T>  one of the world's largest tanker operators  by the end of Japan's business year on March 31  a spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd &lt;IBJT.T> (IBJ) said. Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September  which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion. In December  Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries. Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard. The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares. The spokesman for IBJ  Japan Line's largest creditor  said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long. Commenting on the article  he said the details of the package have not yet been settled."

"1","Indonesia heads for general elections insix weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20 years  economists and officials said. The government expects no spillover of  people power  from the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of President Suharto  victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the coming parliamentary elections is assured. However  Western diplomats said it is the country's deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its stability. Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia  halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5 billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas account for 70 pct of export income. The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections  Suharto  far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay increases or tax cuts  is busy slashing budget spending. The government has also recently increased transport fares and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the second year running  despite inflation now estimated at 8.8 pct. The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985  while the debt service ratio widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986. Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for almost a third of the 1987/88 budget. A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in 1985  and predicted only a one pct rise this year. In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct  the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings. Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its share of new projects being built with overseas money  because it cannot afford even to meet local costs. In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans totalling 1.55 billion dlrs  on top of its external debt of 37 billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed  and the country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors. A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments. Last month  Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are on the way  including two more from the World Bank worth a total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation. U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's fundamental stability. The largest Moslem nation in the world  Indonesia has so far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless it is tackled. It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that unless economic growth is revived  unemployment could reach what it termed  unacceptable levels.  Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of last year  but those considered underemployed number around 35 pct. What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute within Suharto's government  with his Western-trained technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported by the international financial community. But another group supports a protected economy  with more import substitution  the U.S. Embassy report said. The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the dollar last September to help exports and curb imports  and is currently working on a series of measures to further encourage foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector. The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's ability to raise new loans in the future  Western bankers say. So far  despite three packages of economic measures over the past nine months  he has not touched key monopolies that are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by business associates  diplomats and bankers say. Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems."

"1","Republicans in Congress hailedPresident Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid and constructive while Democrats  who control both houses  said Reagan would now have to match his words with action. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes.  But one speech is not enough to rebuild trust.   President Reagan told the American people what they needed to hear  that mistakes were made and he made them   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said. Reagan  responding to the Tower Commission report criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal  said for the first time the Iran arms policy  and not just its implementation  was a mistake and accepted responsibility for the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels. Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the administration would  remain under a cloud  until several key figures in the scandal  including fired National Security Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John Poindexter  have told  the whole truth.  Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as chief of staff  and the replacement of Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC. Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi  said he believed Reagan took the right measure in admitting mistakes without apologising for them. Some House Democrats  including Speaker James Wright of Texas  said earlier they would delay their reaction until tomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess its impact."

"1","The easing of rules governing overseas useof the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency  bond managers and traders said. Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the Eurobond market  few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the Japanese  they said. This lack of real yen demand through the freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese accord to internationalise the yen  they said. The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies  mainly dollars  bond managers said. More than 85 pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven  they added.  The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are only after attractive money   one bond trader said. Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year  boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total Eurobond market  Koichi Kimura  managing director of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd  said recently. Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort to  harakiri  swaps  those with unprofitable pricing. But the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987  said Naoki Yokoyama  manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation. The Euroyen bonds  once issued  are mostly picked up by Japanese trust banks  one trader said. After a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is strong  he added. Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments  traders said.  Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen)   said Masaki Shimazu  manager of Daiwa's bond department. While few foreigners are interested in the secondary market  Japanese commercial banks  regional banks  life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer little currency risk  traders said. The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from 180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small.  We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the Euroyen market   he said. One trader said that although demand from Japanese investors is heavy  it may prove to be only short-term. He said many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S. Interest rates decline further. To encourage further international use of the yen  the ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen commercial paper  the official said  adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers. Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory. Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be.  Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps   one bond manager said. If more financial instruments were available  there might be more trades in yen  he added. Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity  though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities  traders said. The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond maturities within a few months. One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the Japanese currency  he said.  If exporters or importers can raise funds in yen  they will be more willing to agree to using the Japanese yen as a settlement currency   he added. The Finance Ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors.  No major market can keep its status without change   he said."

It said a joint field survey late last month by the association  the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima  Chaiyaphum  Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986.

"1","The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp&lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986  reflecting stronger than expected loan growth  share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985  adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year  probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time  an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise  Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986  when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.  They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand  as their loan portfolio is well balanced   an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986  compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade  the mainstay of the local economy  rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low  with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986  but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system  giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.  The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks   one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and Co>  analysts said.  Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter   an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>  of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>  the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here  for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts  analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts.  The need for provisions was much lower than the year before   said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd.  Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.  Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure  mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>  appears to have improved substantially  analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985."

In recent weeks  there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which  if not controlled  would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government   the statement said. Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct. The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate  which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today's auction  however  the bank left the rate unchanged. Spain's principal measure of money supply  the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP)  grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987. Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good  compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986  ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February  raising government concern. Regarding inflation  recent figures have suggested that prices were under control. Secretary of State for Trade  Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez  said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February  not yet officially announced  fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January  compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year."

"1","Japanese creditor banks are close to adecision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations  international financial sources told Reuters. Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month  they said. The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad  the sources said. Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project  the sources said. Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year  they said. There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks  and perhaps as many as 28  they said. About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil  accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country. The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands  the sources said. The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock. The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad  the sources said. The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans. Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina  they said. The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves  but the ministry has not yet complied. A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries. The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries  but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans."

"1","Iran said its troops repulsed heavy Iraqicounter-attacks and continued their advance through the rugged mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan in overnight fighting on the northern war front. Iran launched the new offensive  codenamed Karbala-7  on Tuesday night among the snow-capped peaks of the Haj Omran border area of northeast Iraq. The Iranian news agency IRNA  received in London  said the troops  continued their successful advance ... With more thrusts into enemy positions.  It said  remnants of Iraqi Brigade 604 was shattered and 200 of its personnel killed or wounded.  One battalion of the 25th Division's Third Brigade thrown into counter-attacks today suffered 70 pct losses  the agency added. Some 208 prisoners of war had been taken from the front. IRNA said the Iranian forces backed by heavy artillery fire were continuing to advance. No Iranian casualties were given. The area between Haj Omran and the Kurdish town of Rawandiz some 65 km inside Iraq was the scene of heavy fighting in 1983. Iran has backed dissident Kurds in the area in attacks on government positions and installations in northern Iraq. IRNA said the Iranian forces captured large amounts of munitions in the latest fighting. The Iraqis have made no comment so far on the Kurdistan fighting  or on advances Tehran reported yesterday on the southern war front east of the strategic Iraqi port of Basra. IRNA said today a group of its reporters visited newly-captured areas on the southern front and found the battlefield littered with the bodies of Iraqi soldiers and burnt military equipment. They quoted an Iranian soldier  Hamid Dehqani  as saying heavy rainfall during the past few days  had paralysed the Iraqi enemy from embarking on any action  against the attacking Iranians. IRNA referred to the  Fish Canal  -- the man-made Fish Lake -- made by the Iraqis as a defensive barrier on the eastern side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The agency yesterday said infantry and armour of the Revolutionary Guards had captured strong defences west of the canal in bitter fighting with Iraqi troops."
"1","Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit anew high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4  compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier  the central bank said. Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4. He said the rise showed signs of slowing  however  because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result. Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise  but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987. In January  Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1 700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion  according to official statistics. Wang Chang-Ming  Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development  told Reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year. The reserves could support imports of more than two years for Taiwan  compared with about three months for Japan and the U.S."

"1","Sri Lanka's largest bank  thegovernment-owned Bank of Ceylon  plans to adopt a more aggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excess liquidity  estimated at some 500 mln rupees  and enlarge the country's export manufacturing base  the bank's new chairman Nimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview. The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to be announced later  he said. Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of Ceylon  the nation's central bank  until January. A Swiss-based non-governmental group  which Sandaratne declined to identify  has agreed in principal to guarantee export credits  he said  but refused to elaborate further. The bank may also consider more actively participating in the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees  or about 70 pct of the total market  he said. Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in its wholly-owned subsidiary  Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd. The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operating here have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake in MBSL  Sandaratne said. He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profits for calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln the previous year. The increase was eroded by increased provisions for bad debts  he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mln allotted for general provisions  he added."
"1","The Papua New Guinea Governmentwill establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects  Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.  We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects   he told Parliament. Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained  he said. The planned agency could take over the state's equity in current developments. Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.  The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way   he said. Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be established or exactly what form it would take  but said the government would study whether it should be directly involved in exploration or development."
"1","The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct againstthe dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today's weekly foreign exchange auction  the central bank said. The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar  against 3.9050 last week. Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold  with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency. The effective rate  including a central bank levy  for transactions in the coming week  was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions. Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time."

"1","U.S. Undersecretary of State for EconomicAffairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.  Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas  much needs to be done   he told a press conference after three days of talks.  What we need is a resolution of trade issues  we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth.  Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year  Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus  which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986. He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips  supercomputers  Kansai airport  agricultural products and car telephones. He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact  Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased  he said."

"1","Japanese private plant and equipmentinvestment will grow 0.1 pct in fiscal 1987  starting April 1  from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing sector spending  the Japan Development Bank said. Capital spending by manufacturing industries  hit hard by the rise of the yen  will fall 5.6 pct  a survey said. Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust  it said. The 0.1 pct overall increase compares to the 3.1 pct rise the bank projected for the current fiscal year. In the manufacturing sector  iron and steel companies are the most pessimistic  with an estimated 18.0 pct spending cut. Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will decline by 18 pct and 11.2 pct respectively  the survey said. In the non-manufacturing sector  transport and leasing service industries are expected to increase their spending by 15.7 pct and 10.6 pct  respectively.

"1","Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Partystarted moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament  deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable. In the absence of the opposition  LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14  parliamentary officials said. The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan. Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based. A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  who has vowed to push through the tax reforms  told reporters:  Watching closely negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties  I would like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly.  The five pct tax  part of Nakasone's tax reform plan  is planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual income and corporate tax. The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower House plenary session  political analysts said. The four opposition parties called the LDP move  an unforgivable  rash act  and said they would fight to scrap the sales tax."

"1","The outlook for the WestGerman economy is relatively bright  with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year  Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute  one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany  is more optimistic than that of the other institutes  some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies.  The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears  all in all  limited   the report said.  On the contrary  a slight rise in exports can be expected.  The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs  trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time  the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending  both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy  the institute said. However  it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries  including the Bundesbank  had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit  causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy  it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned  and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct."

"1","Britain had a visible trade deficit of2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter  official statistics show. Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln. For 1986 as a whole  visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg  sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984. Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday. The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion. In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg. The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln  the CSO said. However  1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985  while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions  particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available."

"1","The Bank of France is likely to cut itsmoney market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall  dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22  which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23  the day after the Paris accord  and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3  where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point  the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2  when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates  while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut  and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday  although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning  banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France  discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target  giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply  the government's key aggregate  finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target  rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985."
"1","The Hong Kong dollar fixed rate marketwas shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced  bankers said. Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue. Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all major players stopped making markets in existing issues. The fixed rate market  which consists mainly of CDs tied to swaps or asset repackaging  began to fall about a month ago due to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs flooded the market in January. Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed. The speculation depressed local interest rates and unleashed a flood of new issues. But the speculation faded in early February and interest rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining the peg  thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate capital market. By late February the market had recovered considerably but Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC)  a unit of the Bank of China  launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today. Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new issue circulated. When the deal was launched the major players quickly suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own issues  brokers said.  We just don't know where the market is going   said a European banker. They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95  within the 10 basis point fee  adding that buying came mainly from sister banks in the Bank of China group. An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct  in line with the market at that time. But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the present market conditionS   the timing was just not right.   If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues now  and then the market would be all right   another dealer said.  But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic   he said.  The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals.  Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the group has not yet been finalised.  Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the deal   said a dealer.  But there are other considerations such as relationship.  He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager. A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new issue.  Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue   he said. Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead managers  whether for Chinese or foreign issues."

"1","Hughes Tool Co said its board hasappointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>. Last night  Hughes directors said it would terminate its agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that the Hughes board had determined to be unreasonable. The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at Hughes.  Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer. Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on condition that they find a buyer approved by the  Department for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's Reed subsidiary  its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic electrical submersible pump business by April 22  the last date the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their agreement. Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions. Hughes said  For reasons Hughes does not fully understand  Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree.  The company said its board found the consent decree to be unreasonable because some  unusual terms  in the decree posed a substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of the combined company  which would have been called Baker Hughes Inc  and would include all of Reed's international assets and its coring and diamond bit assets. Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to sell Reed. The company said the board decision to adopt its own divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker did not accept was unanimous."

"1","Baker International corp said it hasfiled suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co to complete its proposed merger with Baker. Late yesterday  Hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures. Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice Department consent decree. Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger. Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the merger  as an alternative to the consent decree  were  more burdensome  than those of the consent decree themselves. Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs or three pct. Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree. It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to live up to the merger agreement or  substantial  monetary damages it did not name. Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies."
"1","USAir Group Inc said its board hasrejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders  employees or passengers. The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was  highly conditional.  USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each  valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said  In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer  the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made  USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.  TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont  a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders  employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests.  USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont. The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing  the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the  fair price  provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

"1","The U.S. economy is facing severalserious problems which threaten its continued expansion  according to a Congressional report released today. The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near future. Committee Republicans released a separate  more optimistic report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation. Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee  which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.  The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger signals that lie just below the surface   Committee chairman Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.  A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current recovery  while long  is fragile  and we are skating on thin ice   the Maryland Democrat said. He said the danger signals included a decline in investment  increased demand for borrowing which was straining the financial system  a possible increase in inflation fueled by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the nation's farmers. Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around three pct for this year and next  similar to Administration forecasts.  The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're comfortable with the current low rate of inflation  hopeful that interest rates will continue to decline  optimistic that employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident in this nation's resilient  innovative and diversified economy   the Republican report said.  The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress is reducing the federal deficit   the Republicans added. Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but also wanted the government to spend more on education  job training  research and development and health care. They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy if this becomes necessary.  There is now substantial concern about the inflationary effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money supply   the Democrat report said.  At the same time  the increased reliance on foreign sources of capital in American investment markets means that the Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down.   Taken together  the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy is thus not very encouraging   the Democrats said. The Democrats called on the Administration to be more aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking new initiatives to solve the international debt problem. The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been caused by misalignment of the world's currencies  especially the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982. Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to increase American productivity including incentives for saving and investment in plant and equipment and development of a better educated work force."

"1","Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell itsnew XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K.  Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg  slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln  Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However  the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25 000 of its total 47 000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover  finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet  but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an  umbrella  for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods  John Egan said. In the longer term  capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg  but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange  Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p  down from 611p at yesterday's close  after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations  dealers said.

"1","House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbyingcongressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficit about 40 billion dlrs  half through spending cuts and the remainder through tax hikes  congressional sources said. He is backing a half and half plan and has made the suggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committee privately  committee sources said. However  a committee source told Reuters that committee Democrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficit about 40 billion dlrs  half through taxes and the Speaker's move was seen as building support outside the committee. Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has no specifics  although he has floated a stock transfer tax and also has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy. Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress  and some congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax. The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed at reducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed a budget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will not reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billion dlrs  although he claims it will be in the spirit of it."

For Taiwan  Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S.  much larger than that of Japan's  and with huge foreign exchange reserves  it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals   otherwise in two or three years' time  Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan.  Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs  Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable.  Something must give soon. If not  there is a great threat of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend   Yeutter said."

In its first reaction to Tehran reports of a new Iranian offensive on the northern front  Iraq said fighting continues around the strategic mountain peak of Kardamanend  overlooking the Haj Omran-Rawandiz axis close to the Iranian border. A military spokesman said Iran launched its attack in the north  to (turn) Iraqi attention towards that area and relax pressure in the south.  He added   Iraq knows well that Iran's main goal is to occupy Basra in the south and that was the reason why Iraq has repelled their new offensive so decisively and firmly.

"1","Enzon Inc said a newtreatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA has restored the functioning of the immune system in the first two children that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine deaminase. The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease  or  bubble boy disease  Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease that hampers the development of the immune system. It has killed most of its victims before adulthood. Children with the disease are consigned to live in a sterile environment  such as a plastic bubble  to avoid infection  the company said. The study of Enzon's drug  conducted at Duke University  showed that two children suffering from the disease were treated for 11 and seven months  respectively  and were free of serious infection during that time  the company said. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The disease is caused by a missing enzyme  called Adenosine Deaminase  or ADA  that is crucial to the development of the immune system. Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme with a substance called polyethylene glycol  or PEG  serving to disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body  preventing rejection.  Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function occurred in each child  along with an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes  the immune cells that were missing before treatment with PEG-ADA had begun   the study said.  The children are now more active and have begun to gain weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very poor in comparison to normal children of the same age   the study  conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca Buckley  said. The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow transplants  but for most  donors are not available or transplantation is unsuccessful  the company said. Other diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by introducing a PEG coated enzyme  the article noted."

"1","Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earningsfor 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions  lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods  Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year  while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously  with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume. Although the figures were lower  they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc &lt;SC.L> shares  the U.K. Arm of the group  rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985. Also  a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results  which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts  industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted. However  he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987  due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas  which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag  analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period  with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader  Holmes added. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity.  Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on  but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn   he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports.  If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything   he noted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel. This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices  as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down.  OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction   he added."

"1","Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain'sdecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks  saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13  saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank  which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth.  I think it's a good measure   a senior foreign banker said.  It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.   It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run   he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago  the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements  preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad  strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year  the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community  which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct  it is insisting pay rises stay at that level  setting the stage for clashes with trade unions  who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers  students and farmers  whose demands essentially involve more government spending  have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain  which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct  left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year  when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow  following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and  inevitably  push lending rates higher. A companion measure  reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas  also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates."

MCI has seen its profits shaved recently by ATT long distance rate reductions ordered by the FCC following the breakup of the Bell System. The MCI move signals its belief that ATT may raise profits rather than cut rates if deregulated. To allay consumers' fears that deregulation might lead to price increases  Roberts said one alternative open to the FCC would be adoption of a transitional  price cap  concept. Roberts noted that such a plan is backed by FCC commissioner Dennis Patrick  whose is widely expected to be named FCC chairman. Roberts conceded that ATT's deregulation posed risks to MCI.

"1","The Agriculture Department must makea decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase  the president of the American Soybean Association  ASA  said.  The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want  but they have to eventually address this problem   David Haggard  ASA president  told Reuters. USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options  and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan  Haggard said.  I don't know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem   he said. At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here  ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs. The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson  R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran  R-Miss.  which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment. Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed proposals have but said   in all honesty  we do not want to see the farm bill be torn apart.  He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to a market loan  there are still numerous ways the USDA could change the loan without new legislation. Making the loan partially in certificates which would not have to be paid back would be one option  he said."

"1","French official reserves fell 45.06billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December  the Finance Ministry said in a statement. It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS). Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month  the ministry said. This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund  counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM). But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments. The Bank of France  in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks  intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord  in an attempt to hold down the mark  which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar  and simultaneously shore up the franc. On January 11  the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc  relieving pressure on the French currency. The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74 billion at end December. Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs. Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion francs from 75.27 billion at end December. Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln francs to 19.31 billion francs."

"1","Securities and Exchange Commissionchairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping insider trading  but the chairman of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about conditions on Wall Street.  Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey   Rep. Edward Markey  D-Mass  the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities.  Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come   Markey said.  The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing.  Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky  Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment  high fines and disbarment from the securities industry.  Insider trading has not been eradicated  but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders   Shad said in his statement. Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years. Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts. N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo  the senior subcommittee Republican  said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.

"1","Personal taxation has emerged as themajor economic issue in Finnish general elections later this month  and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards indirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more market-oriented banking practices  economists say. Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party  Finland's second largest  may gain enough clout after the elections to join a coalition government which is still likely to be dominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa. But the economists point out that Conservative economic policies differ only slightly from the governments'  and that trade with the Soviet Union will not be affected. Helsinki bankers said a new government  including the Conservatives for the first time in 20 years  could bring about a shift from direct to indirect taxation. The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has embarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation  which is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The opposition has also called for reforms  but they differ over how to regain lost state revenues. One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax exemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds. Hannu Halttunen  of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP)  told Reuters  We want to be more free in setting interest rates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual investors. If tax on interest is introduced  then we prefer a system with taxation of real interest gains.  Under present laws  bank customers are exempted from tax on interest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said this had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering tougher inter-bank competition. A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation was too strong a word to use in a Finnish context  but a Conservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.  It would probably result in new practices that have been seen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in Finland   he said  in a reference to money market instruments. All parties  especially the Conservatives  have been careful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue. Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years ago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist  but has now moderated its stance  political analysts say. Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter system  and is balanced under long-term accords. In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth 30 billion markka  but trade in the past two years has been declining due to the fall in the price of crude oil  which accounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union. The bankers said taxation had become the major economic theme of the campaign because there were few other issues. Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986  compared with 5.9 pct in 1985  and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of the workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct. The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign trade surplus compared with 1985  from 2.50 billion markka to 5.04 billion markka. Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the largest party in the 200-seat Parliament  with some 26 pct of the vote. They currently hold 57 seats. The Centre Party  the other major coalition partner  is also expected to hold on to its 37 seats. But increased Conservative support and a decline for the Communists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives into government. They currently hold 44 seats."

It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed  it's a question of who has to pay   Wright said. He has opposed deficit reduction proposals included in Reagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients  tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for home purchases. Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut but has said other options such as a tax on securities transfers were merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.  There has to be a recognition of reality   he said."
"2","International Coffee Organization  ICO producing countries will present a proposal for reintroducing export quotas for 12 months from April 1 with a firm undertaking to try to negotiate up to September 30 any future quota distribution on a new basis  ICO delegates said. Distribution from April 1 would be on an unchanged basis as in an earlier producer proposal  which includes shortfall redistributions totalling 1.22 mln bags  they said. Resumption of an ICO contact group meeting with consumers  scheduled for this evening  has been postponed until tomorrow  delegates said."
"2","International Coffee Organization (ICO)exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption before presenting it to importers tomorrow  ICO delegates said. The change  which will be discussed tonight informally among producers  follows talks after the formal producer session with the eight-member producer splinter group and will affect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from April one  they said. The proposed share-out would still include shortfall declarations  they said."
"2","OPEC may be forced to meet before ascheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices  oil industry analysts said.  The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems   said Daniel Yergin  director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.  OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way   said Paul Mlotok  oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.  OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas  fixed prices and set differentials   said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named.  The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again   he added. David T. Mizrahi  editor of Mideast reports  expects OPEC to meet before June  although not immediately. However  he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.  They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil  but in late March and April when demand slackens   Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.  Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.  OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then   said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.  Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production   he told Reuters in a telephone interview."
"2","Switzerland's economy  combining lowunemployment  financial stability and a large external payments surplus  is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government  it said. The OECD  in its annual report on Switzerland  picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year  but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce  leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct  the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year  against 1.69 in the second half of 1986  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last  reflecting buoyant private consumption  meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But  given Switzerland's large external surplus  there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which  if only in a small way  would contribute to improving international balances   the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year  with a 3.25 pct growth rate  after several years of relative weakness  it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate  but should still outstrip overall GDP  it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987  and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors  it said. As a consequence  growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry  two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc  and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets  could lead to a loss of international market share for both  it said. Particularly for the banks   recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system  which has shown substantial flexibility in the past  is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position   it said."
"2","Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today  with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However  delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme  delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers  want to have the ball only in their court and it isn t fair   minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1  using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares  with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30  delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo  allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market  Colombia 17 pct  Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct  with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability  using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share  and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share  delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package.  Anything is possible at this phase   even adjournment of the meeting until March or April  one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas  the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result  industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled  so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either  they said."
"2","Kuwait s Oil Minister  in remarkspublished today  said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying:  None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Kuwait  they said  was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.  This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability  it will do so   the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.  If we can sell more than our quota at official prices  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share  it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever   he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar  which industry sources said was selling less than 180 000 bpd of its 285 000 bpd quota  because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered  a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.  Because it was charging its official price  of 16.67 dlrs a barrel  it had lost custom  he said but did not elaborate. However  Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad  he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body s members. Ecuador s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude  and was to seek this at talks this month of opec s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members  in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar  he said:  We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.  But he expected the situation would later improve."
"2","Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy  the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues  the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia  the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer  has been severely hit by last year s fall in world oil prices  which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.  (It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation  both as it pertains to investments and imports   the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia s agricultural sector  but also reviews the country s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation   there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.   This group strongly favours an import substitution economy   the report says. Indonesia s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected  and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May  which broadened areas for foreign investment  reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero  and the economy may even have contracted a bit.  This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s   the report notes. Indonesia  the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million  is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook.  For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.   Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity  real declines in construction and trade  and a reduced level of growth in agriculture   the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform  the Bank said."

"2","Saudi riyal interbank deposits weresteady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market. Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices. Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation. A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity. Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4  5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven  six yesterday. One  three  and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8  3/8  7-1/8  6-7/8 and 7-3/8  1/8 pct respectively.

"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerreiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market  the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices  Nazer said Saudi Arabia  is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.  Nazer  quoted by SPA  said recent pressure on free market prices  may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.  Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord  under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets  which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica  OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman  who is also Nigerian Oil Minister  said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.  We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market  but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions   he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister  Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah  said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing."
"2","The International Coffee Organization(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night  but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. The special meeting  called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices  was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement  delegates said. The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September  they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system  delegates said. Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter."
"2","Poland's talks in Washington with theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete  open and frank  a senior Polish banker was quoted as saying. Wladyslaw Baka  head of Poland's National Bank  told the official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.  Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for Poland's difficult economic position   PAP quoted Baka as saying. Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial obligations to the U.S.   but not in a short time  and not without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.  Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June  after a 36-year absence  IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. A major report is expected to be issued in Washington soon. Poland has said it will not be able to meet interest repayments and debt principle falling due this year."
"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers  Community officials said. The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's Brussels Commission  which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses  which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy  demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals  over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil  Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year  an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices  coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms  which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the  green  exchange rate system  which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax  of up to 330 Ecus per tonne  would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds  but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States  which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes  which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line."
"2","Saudi crude oil output last month fellto an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January  Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week  the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage  which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers  the four ex-partners of Aramco  the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>  Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month  when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100 000 bpd last month  compared to zero in January  while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200 000 bpd each."

"2","Mine and industry officials frommost member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96 000 tonnes in the year started March 1  according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports  agreed in January  is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50 000 tonnes from 70 000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan  Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28 526 tonnes  Indonesia 24 516  Thailand 19 000  Bolivia 13 761  Zaire 1 736 and Nigeria 1 461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However  the tonnage allocated to it  7 000 tonnes  is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia  the world's leading producer  said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31 500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3 000 tonnes after exports of 28 500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24 516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24 636. In Bangkok  Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19 000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence  the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles  and income tax exemptions would be permitted  he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production  industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo  Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18 367 tonnes in 1986  up from 17 359 in 1985  Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13 761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9 000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20 000 of the 28 000 workers at the state mining company Comibol  which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines  Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1 461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1 000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106 000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21 000 and 7 000 tonnes respectively during the quota period."
"2","Hungary is to embark on a new series ofausterity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints. But Zoltan Boesze  chief of the Finance Ministry's budget financing division  told Reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided  quite severe  measures were needed.  All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures   he said. Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Boesze said:  The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results  and of course the Fund would support these efforts.  IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year. Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms  which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall  Boesze said. Subsidies to state firms  including grants to maintain low consumer prices  exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986  up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.  I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies   Boesze said.  The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful.  Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities.  I believe these reserves should not be used at all   he said. Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product  which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987  but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. This would mean a severe cut in living standards  as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1. About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies  but that social considerations made this difficult. But he added:  I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.  He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims. Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. Between 100 000 and 150 000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures. Istvan Nagy  a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law  told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. After subsidies to state enterprises  the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986  Boesze said. Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs  according to provisional figures  while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank  mostly from abroad  and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a  very difficult  situation  but not in crisis. There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year  however  and borrowing must be used more effectively.  Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous   Berecz said."
"2","Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks  held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations  will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus  U.S. Officials said.  We appreciate their frustration   a senior Japanese government official said.  But we are also frustrated.  The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard  forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade  but it will  he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.  It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments   a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance  which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days  the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing  and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government  which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports  as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices.  It condemns Japan without due process   one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen  he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill  particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S.  Officials said. Nevertheless  Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position  especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.  We have no leverage   one official admitted. As a result  Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields  including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers  officials said."
"2","The European Community Commission saidit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices. The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint  Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers  forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses  it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs. The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority."
"2","Argentina's chief debt negotiatorsaid he was confident of a prompt accord with international creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.  I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and quick negotiation   Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world financial officials. Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit. Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable  but Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt. He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to meet the targets  adding that the banks' attitude had improved following Brazil's decision. The United States and a group of other industrial nations on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan. Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Michel Camdessus."
"2","Deputy oil ministers from six GulfArab states will meet in Bahrain today to discuss coordination of crude oil marketing  the official Emirates news agency WAM reported. WAM said the officials would be discussing implementation of last Sunday's agreement in Doha by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil ministers to help each other market their crude oil. Four of the GCC states - Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates (UAE)  Kuwait and Qatar - are members of the Organiaation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some face stiff buyer resistance to official OPEC prices."

He met with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari  Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and other high-ranking Japanese officials."
"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerreiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilize the market  the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices  Nazer said Saudi Arabia  is fully adhering by the ... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.  Saudi Arabia was a main architect of December pact under which OPEC agreed to cut its total oil output ceiling by 7.25 pct and return to fixed prices of around 18 dollars a barrel."
"2","Kuwait's oil minister said in a newspaperinterview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying that  none of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd). Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits."
"2","Brazil would not have suspendedpayments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.  It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't finance a little bit more quickly and easily   Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy. Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds  he replied   Yes  because our country did not receive financing from these agencies.  Asked how long the payment suspension would last  Funaro said  It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side.  Brazil  with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs  stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks. Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans. He said the net transfer was hurting the country's continued growth and capacity to import goods.  Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil   Funaro said. He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see  automatic  official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves  now reported to be below four billion dlrs. Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs. But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions  the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt.  We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment   Funaro said. He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years  leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available. Funaro said U.S officials understand his position  but they don't like it.  Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain  West Germany  France  Switzerland and Italy. Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines."

"2","Coffee quota talks at the InternationalCoffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon  but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas  delegates said. The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically  with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future  they said. Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time.  Anything could happen   one delegate said."
"2","Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks  he said  adding  This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.  The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983  however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S.  Japanese and European banks  Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis   Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors   central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks  followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions  worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain  France  West Germany  Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans  giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus  its chief means of servicing its foreign debt  started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt.  What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service  because we cannot service all that   he said.  I really think we have to change the old rules.  Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments  rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis  Funaro said  We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks  because the banks have some limits.   It is a political discussion from our point of view   he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks  If I've got some solution from the governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks.  He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982.  You must open these mechanisms   he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments  they understood Brazil had no other choice  as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed  because we can't stay as we were the last few years.   I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.  he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy  Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year  against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world  Funaro said  although its share of international trade was only one pct.   The solution is linked with growth  not recession   he said  noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments  as opposed to commercial banks  now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt."
"2","Tanzania's ruling Chama chaMapinduzi (CCM) party has endorsed the government's economic reform programme but said it did not think more changes  such as a further devaluation of the shilling  would be needed. Tanzania has devalued the shilling more than 65 pct in less than a year and has started to overhaul inefficient government firms in line with a package agreed with the IMF. The CCM's national executive committee said it was satisfied with government efforts to implement IMF conditions.  Measures taken so far are satisfactory and there is no need to take other ones -- the devaluation of the shilling included   it said. The committee's statement was in response to a government report on the IMF package submitted last Thursday."
"2","World animal health experts called for acampaign to eradicate the lethal cattle disease Rinderpest in Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Nepal and Pakistan  a statement from a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) meeting here said. Some 230 mln dlrs is needed over two years to vaccinate the entire susceptible cattle population in Bangladesh and Pakistan and high-risk areas of the other three countries. In India some 240 mln cattle are estimated to be at risk from the disease. The experts recommended the campaign be funded mostly by the governments of the five nations  with help from the FAO. Similar campaigns are needed in Egypt  Yemen  Iraq and Iran."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves  a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support. Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. Funaro  accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros  is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy  arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium  because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view.  Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis  describing the meeting as an initial contact. He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request. After travelling this week to France  Germany  Switzerland and Italy  Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks."
"2","European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market  which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of  manifest crisis.  But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries  with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead  in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures  they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a  voluntary  basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area  that of hot rolled coils  and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program  particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240 000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes."
"2","Talks at the extended special meeting ofthe International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued  but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge  delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September  with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year  they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord  other delegates said. No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today  delegates said. A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report  delegates said."
"2","U.S. tin disposals should have littleeffect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96 000 tonnes in the year started March 1  a government official said. The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord  ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile.  We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game   said Thomas O'Donnell  Director of International Commodities at the State Department. Last year the United States released about 4 900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms."
"2","Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaroflatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters  Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris  he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago  put Brazil in a very big recession.   We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF   he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks  the statement  which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands  said.  That was not my impression of the meeting   Funaro said;  But if the (British) answer is more or less like this  then that means nothing is helping to find a solution.  Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies  rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.  Since 1982  all official agencies have been closed to my country   he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington  Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved  Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.  We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme   he said   We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens.  Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies  which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year.  Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort   he said.  What we have to offer is our cooperation."
"2","Efforts to break an impasse betweencoffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to have failed  senior delegates said after a contact group meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.

"2","U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats  another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture. In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors  Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers  who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.  This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market   Yeutter said. Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT. He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans  making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine  and closer in price to expensive European butter.  I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal   Yeutter said.  It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks)   he said."
"2","A special meeting of the InternationalCoffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas  ICO delegates said. Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous  often heated talks  delegates said. Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds. Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting."
"2","French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year  the same rate as last year  unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988  from its present 10.9 pct  it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was  increasingly ill-adapted to demand  selling goods at  uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.   France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months   it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986  it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to  a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.  This could result in further major losses of market share  particularly in the non-OECD area  which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports  it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved  the authorities would have  little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre  even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly   it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands  contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next  the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year  the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987  and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices  caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.  We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises  and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost   one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report  indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct  against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year  with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area  the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival  West Germany  could fall to just one pct this year  it said. On the other hand  the report noted  consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.  For the disinflationary process to continue   and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability  it is essential that wage restraint continue   it said."
"2","European Community (EC) farm ministerswere fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. Meanwhile  protests from angry European farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food production appeared to be gathering strength. In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from Brussels. The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of Malaga  citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at EC duties. Towards the end of last week  about 10 000 angry West German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed EC prices. In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review  at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies  Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas. Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. That decision  agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations  was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive  but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores  but the Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package. Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem  and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this year of some 5.7 billion dlrs."
"2","Opec remains within its agreed outputceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day  and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock  he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now  he replied:  Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).  He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market  but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price.  We hope the weak price will be overcome  and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.  Refiners  he said  appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together."
"2","The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today  coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now  they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set  delegates said. Quotas  the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement  were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight  heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue  the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring  coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil  the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively  each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum  U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks  said in a statement after the council adjourned   A majority of producers  led by Brazil  were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.  We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market  instead of their political influence in the ICO.  Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered   Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas  not negotiate them.  Previously  quotas were determined by historical amounts exported  which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks  which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia  the second largest exporter  to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems  illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt  have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings  particularly some African nations and Colombia  are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas  analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year  producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31  but the full council is not due to meet again until September  delegates said."

The ministers will resume talks at 10.00 local time in a bid to clear the way for a full-scale review of proposed reforms for other surplus sectors. Diplomats said member states were unable to settle differences over new rules limiting farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted butter at high guaranteed prices into EC cold stores.

"2","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that  since bilateral trade began in 1972  China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all  mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that  if China wants to obtain GSP status  it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  for which it applied in July 1986  and  not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.  The official said China was well aware of the laws  some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's  but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years  which the U.S. Side won  he said. But  for the first time  China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods  which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case  he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.  China has the potential to disrupt world markets  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT   the diplomat said. Poland  Czechoslovakia  Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT.  The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type   Shultz said.  China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation   he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs  especially for exports  and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month  China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with  guidance planning  and economic levers. The diplomat said that  to join GATT  China had much to do."

"2","West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems  senior West German banking sources said. The sources  speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg  also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  who met Funaro yesterday. Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt  which totals some 109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening. Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund. However  the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a  rapprochement  with the IMF.  Consultations are the least that can be expected   said one banker. Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982. Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks  holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt  were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks  involving separate discussions with the regions. Such a move would be in Brazil's interest  since European banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions  such as interest capitalisation. The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach  saying:  There must be one committee and one solution.  But he added:  There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account.  German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered.  The menu must become richer   the banker said. Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States  because of their lower exposure. According to Bundesbank data from September last year  West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit."
"2","Opec remains within its agreed outputceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day  and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock  he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now  he replied:  Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).  He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market  but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price.  We hope the weak price will be overcome  and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.  Refiners  he said  appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together."

"2","The collapse of International CoffeeOrganization  ICO  talks on export quotas yesterday removes the immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the customs service to monitor coffee imports  analysts here said. The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.). However  the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not immediately needed  one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.  You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now) this is an urgent issue   the coffee analyst said."
"2","Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community  EC  on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil  averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States. De Croo  in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders  said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries. But he added   I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe   adding  so there will be a compromise.  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax  the United States would respond  vigorously  to protect its trade rights and access to community markets. De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States. U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards. He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle  which is also opposed by the United States. De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1  1988. He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule."

The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on deficit financing and exchange and interest rates  issues likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery program. Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating industries  repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors and other agricultural needs.

"2","Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could react was to retaliate. De Croo said at a news conference  if you limit textile imports  you will re-orient textiles to Europe.  And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods. Congress passed a textile bill two years ago  but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners. A similar bill has been introducted this year  in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal. De Croo  here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen  said if a textile bill passed   the only way we could react would be retaliation  and it would cause more retaliation  which is not a good way to deal with problems.  He said if a textile bill was enacted   we will impose taxes on a lot of American products.   He said  it would be stupid. We have to avoid that.  He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan  because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States  and not with EC nations  but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles. De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues  saying  each time we come in contact  it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.  He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.  This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers   De Croo said."

A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas.

"2","Coffee producing countries must quicklymap out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization  ICO  to reach agreement on export quotas  Gilberto Arango  president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association  said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers  including Brazil  in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas  suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However  he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York  its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt  decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts  he said.  In Colombia's case  we watch with consternation that  while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking  countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein   Cardenas said."

"2","Crude oil prices rallied today  movingover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices  analysts said.  The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market  hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting   said Sanford Margoshes  oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.  But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating   he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line  Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil  analysts said.  They are trying to make sure that no one discounts  and to prevent that  it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales   Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar  which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia  with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman  was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley  oil analyst with Smith Barney  Upham Harris and Co said   both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.  He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo  which refused discounts to Japanese buyers  brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai  which sent prices up on Mideast sours  with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs  up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.  The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result   Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors  including demand  which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart  an indepedent petroleum economist  said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986."
"2","Coffee prices may have to fall even lowerto bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas  ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization  ICO  producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1 270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1 314 stg  down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices  some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview  Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions.  If we have failed at the ICO  at least we have tried   Dauster said  adding  now it is time to go and sell coffee.  But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month  Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market  in one go  but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said  objective criteria  like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares  Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the  ad hoc  way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a  simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate  policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different  objective criteria  achieve different share-outs of quota  Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.  We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage   one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely  while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found.  Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now   one consumer said."
"2","Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuringother members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas  said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer  speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference  also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.  Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down   Wellemeyer said.  The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again   he said. In recent weeks  oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota  pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today  with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices  Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day  or 18 pct of the world demand for oil."
"2","The European Community  EC  sold75 000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market  the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33 000 tonnes of wheat  it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225 000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50 000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season  it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board  BWB  expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production  and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand  the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400 000 tonnes  but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600 000 tonnes versus 700 000 a year ago."

We are now in a favourable position to improve the situation in the dairy sector   he told a news conference. The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of butter in EC stores  as the deal should prevent major new stocks from accruing. A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in December  but approval was held up by a row over Commission proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus stocks into store. After 36 hours of negotiations  ministers agreed detailed rules for such a suspension  allowing it only when new public stocks of butter exceed 180 000 tonnes and when market prices were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores. Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for cuts in EC farm price cuts  notably in cereals  in the coming season. The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay compensation to those who opt for less intensive production methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections had forced him to withdraw sections of this package  for which he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years. He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older farmers to take early retirement  either taking their land out of agricultural production or passing it to successors. The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports to hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give full details  but member state aid would be subject to  strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition."

Out of this  traders in the U.K. Received 43 500 tonnes  in the Netherlands 12 000  in Denmark 4 000 and in West Germany 1 000 tonnes. Earlier today  London and Paris traders said they expected the subsidy for the current season whites campaign for licences to end-July to be between 43.00 and 43.45 Ecus per 100 kilos. They had also forecast today's total authorised sugar tonnage export awards to be between 60 000 and 80 000 tonnes versus 103 000 last week when the restitution was 43.699 Ecus."
"2","Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta planthis month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels  director-general of the INFE export institute  Apolonio Ruiz Ligero  said.  The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now   he said.  This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy  which have a similar productive structure   he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans  tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine  as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan  while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand  which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.  The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition   he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand  while turning their backs on foreign markets.  They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation   he said.  Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."

"2","Latin American debtor nations arestill willing to negotiate on their debts  World Bank director for Latin America and the Caribbean Rainer Steckhan said. In an article published in today's Handelsblatt daily  Steckhan said despite decisions by Peru  Costa Rica  Ecuador and Brazil to suspend some interest payments  these nations were still willing to talk constructively about their debts.  These countries are still prepared to negotiate  and the instruments of cooperation developed thus far provide the means to deal with the crisis over time   Steckhan said. Several highly indebted nations have made great efforts to meet their debt payments  especially Latin American countries  Steckhan said. Chile achieved gross national product growth of five to six pct last year and quadrupled its trade surplus from 1984  despite lower prices of key commodity exports like copper. Mexico  hit by a catastrophic earthquake and declines in world oil prices also boosted its non-oil exports by one third in 1986  the highest growth rate in its post-war history. The World Bank's annual lending to Latin America rose to 4.8 billion dlrs last year from three billion in 1984  he said."
"2","The 350 mln Ecu three-year package ofsocial and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products  EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this  extensification  scheme  farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals  beef  veal and wine  they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage  while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case  farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques  the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details  but said member state aid would be subject to  strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition.  EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay  early retirement  pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production  rather than passing it on to their heirs  would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed."

"2","Failure of talks on re-establishingInternational Coffee Organization  ICO  coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States  particularly the State Department  to reassess its position  but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by  objective criteria   U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum  assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks  told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be  flexible  in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas  but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations  led by the U.S.  proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks  while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil  by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports  as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks  but  nobody is proposing we change our position.  However  other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries  led by Brazil and Colombia  to soften the consumer position.  Knowing that its next crop is fairly large  Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers   said one U.S. official. The U.S. official  who asked not to be identified  said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries  particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries  faced with mounting debt problems  to the U.S. State department  and to the National Security Council in the White House  for an easing of the U.S. position  U.S. officials said. The State department  a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy  may then face conflicting pressures  particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America  U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group  which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question  U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London  the U.S. was supported by the U.K.  the Netherlands  West Germany  Japan  Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria  U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However  U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult  although not impossible  for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important  U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement."

"2","The world trade body GATT has decided toset up an arbitration panel to rule on objections by Canada and the European Community to a customs user fee imposed by the U.S. Government  a GATT spokesman said. Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) council meeting that the fee  which imposes a tax on an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1  1986  is illegal under GATT rules. U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee  imposed by the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985  does not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many other countries. Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine the dispute  instead of a panel empowered to rule on it. In another development  Hong Kong  supported by a large number of developing countries  attacked the  textile and apparel trade act of 1987  introduced in the U.S. Congress last February 19. Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is  blatantly protectionist.  He added there is  almost nothing about the bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent with either the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA).  If the bill were to be passed by Congress  Cartland said  it would forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation of world trade in textiles.  GATT's council also decided to set up a working party to study China's application for full GATT membership. The group is due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15."
"2","The new European Community dairyregime agreed last night is too complicated and may destabilise prices  Abele Kuypers  secretary of the dairy section of the Dutch farmers' organisation Landbouwschap said. He welcomed the decision to write off existing stocks of butter and skimmed milk powder and agreed there should be some reduction of pressure on stores but said the Landbouwschap was unhappy at the mechanism for limiting sales to intervention except when prices fall too far. But Harm Schelhaas  chairman of the Milk Commodity Board  was less worried by the new dairy regime. Dutch milk output will fall by up to six pct this year due to the new regime  but cheese output should rise  he said."
"2","Turkey expects a 1986 balance of paymentsdeficit of 1.5 billion dlrs  well over target  but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields  Ali Tigrel  director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said. He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct  up from 5.1 pct in 1985  which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year. This year's target of 20 pct  might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful   he said. Tigrel  whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning  said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall  originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.  We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years   he added. His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey  which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.  In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments  we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit   he said. Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.  We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations   he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted  Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports  and production incentives were being considered.  We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned   Tigrel said. He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies  begun in 1980  was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied  but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible."
"2","Drilling for oil in California islikely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices  industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick  heavy and expensive to extract  oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling  they said.  Companies will probably only drill their best prospects   said John Curti  an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs  about one-quarter of the total available  were drilling for oil onshore in California last week  compared to about 70 last year  said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services  which tracks California drilling activity.  It's in the dregs right now   said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling  said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year  prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade  Line 63 blend  have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells  those producing less than 10 barrels a day  and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract  Malmgreen said.  It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs   Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil  and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick  heavy oil  he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now  analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch  Kern County  which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil  exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986  compared to 137 in 1985  according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled.  I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year   Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade  Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986  the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43 521 from more than 50 000  said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease  California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level  analysts said. Between February and October 1986  California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd  Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls  compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983  according to the California Department of Conservation.  Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels   Guerard said."

According to latest ONIC statistics  the main buyers were Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86 period  West Germany 480 450 tonnes against 717 689  the Netherlands 462 048 (532 299) and Belgium 417 887 tonnes (919 337). British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and January 31  Britain bought 274 665 tonnes against 642 800 tonnes  ONIC figures showed. But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258 507 tonnes against 2 751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal bought 37 599 tonnes compared with zero. ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community countries was due to British competition."
"2","The size of French 1986/87 carryoverbarley stocks  estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700 000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying  French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said. He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86. Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention. A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention  Vieux said without detailing the amount. The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700 000 tonnes against 200 000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155 000 tonnes in 1985/86. The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize  he said."
"2","The ruling GATT Council deferred adecision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors. David Woods  spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15. The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips  officially known as semiconductors. The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices  allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries. The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market. Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong  Canada  Switzerland  Singapore  Sweden  Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate. Japan's delegate  Minoru Endo  and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded  but they were willing to continue bilateral talks."

David Wood  official spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row. U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home.

"2","The U.K. Offshore oil industry hassuffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not sustain any permament damage  Minister of State for Energy Alick Buchanan-Smith said. The drilling  diving and supply vessels sectors had been most affected  Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy committee. He noted  however  that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production. He added that a report by the manpower services committee which said 14 000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300 000. Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November. They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs. Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas  noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation."
"2","Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviriablamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation  ICO  talks on export quotas.  We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil  where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions   Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes  both from producing and consuming nations  made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists  Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences  not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia  because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks  would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria  Colombia can hope to earn about 1 500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports  which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1 400 mln dlrs from 1986. Colombia  which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year  exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30."
"2","A senior British official said thatprotectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon  secretary for trade and industry  said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports  which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers   the community would have to retaliate.  His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo  who said if the bill passed  the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit  which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations  16.7 billion dlrs.  The more united pressure there could be  the better   he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.  But if both sides drew back from the brink that time   he said    it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.  Channon added that  There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines.  He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and  the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better.  He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States  adding  if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT  what is to happen to the rest of us?"
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.

Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership  Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT  which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade  would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries  he said.  That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business   Yeutter said.  I think China will develop into a fine market for us   he added."

We (all agencies) are together on this   said one U.S. trade official. One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax  there will be a great cost.  U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate  has yet been drawn up.  I don't think we're at that point yet   said one trade official  adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package. Suzanne Early  assistant trade representative  told Reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation  she said  sometimes its better not to be specific.  U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax."
"2","Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrsin 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration between national and international markets  the OECD said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34 pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in the relative importance of the instruments used in international financing. Straight bond offerings  equity related securities and euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined. The OECD said another striking feature of international capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries  which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing. Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing through the flotation of fixed-interest securities. This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps. Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a rapidly expanding market for euro-equities. A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger debt management policies. Growing integration with national markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on international markets. It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to traditional forms of bank lending. Turning to 1987  the OECD pointed to indications of a possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas. It said many market participants saw little scope for a further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead. It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in demand of recent years  although it was likely more borrowers would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided by the market for euro-commercial paper.  It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from lower-rated borrowers   the report said  adding that any major advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would require a significantly broader investor base."
"2","The ruling GATT Council today set up aformal dispute panel to examine a U.S. complaint that a Canadian law prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was discriminatory. David Wood  official spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row. U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home. Robert White  Canada's deputy chief of delegation  replied the law was in line with GATT rules  and was for conservations reasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel."
"2","Ivory Coast today predicted that thepresent coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market  Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions.  I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April   he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1 265 sterling a tonne  the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.  An initiative from IACO is likely very soon   he said without elaborating.  Following the London collapse  we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market   he said. Questioned by journalists  the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year  the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting  the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed  his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future  despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast  long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies  is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee. Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986  according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate."
"2","OPEC countries are all sticking firmly toofficial crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter  Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto  attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference  blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand.  If we stick to the production limitation  the third quarter will be in better balance.  He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices  Subroto said:  Apparently they have taken care of that.   They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they'll help each other   he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.  Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices   he said."
"2","The highly visible drama involving theyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies  thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions  Japanese and European research officials said. The officials  looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations  told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture  which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis  to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways  not least in terms of rare international cooperation  the September  1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture  in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance  but not necessarily central significance  the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place  the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.  You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now  and that was well before Plaza   he said. On February 25  1985  the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20  the Friday before Plaza  it was 242. Since then  despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action  the dollar trend has been down  down  down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which  but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986  Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms  five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January  Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S  against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms  but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.  The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe  where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms  which is what is important to them. Suddenly  instead of the U.S.  It is Europe that is laying the golden egg   said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales  but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base  compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms  a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance  and which will cause problems.  This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore  Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge   said Azusa Hayashi  Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry.  If you want my objective view  I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year  we asked for moderation in exports  and this year we may have to do so again   he said."
"2","A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecucoins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March 23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each  a Finance Ministry spokesman said. Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold from the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely to be between 8 500 and 9 000 francs. At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of thousands of the gold coins will be minted  he said. They will be sold both in Belgium and abroad. The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu  the  basket  comprised of the 12-nation European Community's currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo. The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark Eyskens  who currently presides over the EC's council of economic and finance ministers  has called the issue a political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete. The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand is expected to come from coin collectors."

"2","Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost itseconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure  saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are  too sophisticated to convert into financial terms   one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy  and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.  Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect  yes  but they only contributed to largely internal  economic problems   one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy  an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy  an expert on Polish economic affairs  it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States  as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely  he said  dismissing the estimate as  a theoretical projection based on a high point  which has no real scientific evaluation.  A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered  slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln  as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion  official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment  textiles  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.   Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons   said one expert.  It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.   There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it   another said  adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as  nebulous   one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland  which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry.  MFN doesn't really mean anything  only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now   said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive  and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S.  Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently   Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult  and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.  While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation  it says it has a  moral right  to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said  The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.  Nevertheless  Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka  in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank  made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States   but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.  He stressed that the U.S.  had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.  Putting it more sharply  one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank  IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role.  As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations   he said  citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate."

It is under separate administration from the Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa  which has already received substantial aid as part of international efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on trade routes through South Africa. But this is the first international aid package for TRC  which also carries cargo for Uganda  Zaire and Burundi."
"2","OPEC crude oil output in the first fewdays of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd  down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December  a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders  industry executives and analysts in Europe  the Middle East  Africa  Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system  which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200 000 bpd above the ceiling  largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait  the figures show. The UAE  together with the much smaller producer Ecuador  was also producing above quota in the first days of March  the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output  together with Iran s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March  the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February  against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200 000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait  which has consistently denied quota violations  was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200 000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948 000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria  both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230 000 bpd  and this fell to 180 000 bpd in early March compared with its 285 000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd  down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural Policy  French milk producers said in a press release. But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said repercussions of the plan will affect dairies  not farmers.  If there are negative repercussions  it will be at the level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets for butter and milk   he told journalists during a visit to Rouen. FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals  rejected by ministers  would have frozen land prices  he said. The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.

"2","Congressional ire is rising againstthe multinational development banks which make loans to help other countries produce goods in direct competition with beleagured U.S. farmers and miners. With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year and a farm economy in the doldrums  Congress is pressing to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.  American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct competition with our producers   Senator Don Nickles  an Oklahoma Republican  said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans. Nickles and Senator Steven Symms  a conservative Republican from Idaho  have introduced legislation that would strictly limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus commodities or minerals. Current law requires that the United States vote against such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately approved by the banks. Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S. policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised at two Senate committee hearings last week. Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations   As a policy matter  we oppose loans for production of commodities in oversupply.  The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989. Nickles  Symms and others also have cited other loans such as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at low interest rates for agriculture. Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S. funding of development banks by the amount of these loans. But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal  the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared Congress. This year's version  called the Foreign Agricultural Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote against loans designed to increase production of surplus commodities and minerals. Also  the recipient countries would have to prove that the production  marketing and export of the commodities could be handled without government subsidy. If the loan is approved over U.S. objections  the United States would not increase or replenish funds for that institution until it agrees to stop making such loans. Objections to such loans have most often been raised by conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S. funding for these international development banks. But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised similar concerns among more moderate senators. The administration opposes any legislation that would tie its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be instances in which a country needed the money to continue its moves toward U.S. policies in other areas. Baker said the United States would continue to use its leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization measures  often in the form of elimination of subsidies. Two House Republicans  Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho and Beau Bolter of Texas  have introduced the bill. But it faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has blocked its consideration by the House in the past. Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any related legislation this year  an aide said."
"2","Officials and diplomats said EC farmministers  who earlier this week ended another marathon negotiating session  achieved more than ever before in the fight to end food surpluses  and delighted EC officials are now preparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas. Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil  lakes  and level the  grain mountain  that have brought the Community so much unwelcome publicity. Earlier this week  ministers finally agreed after 36 hours of negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cut milk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks  now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes. Officials said new rules  which place strict limits on farmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices  could be expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle and pave the way for reform in other surplus sectors. The deal was reached despite determined attempts at backsliding by some states as the implications of the original outline accord reached last December began to sink in.  Despite coming under tremendous pressure  the ministers never wavered from the main features of the deal   one senior official said  adding the result augured well for talks later this month on other reforms. The Commission is leading the fight against food surpluses and has now proposed the most severe annual price review  at which ministers fix farm support prices  in the EC's history. Most prices would be cut or frozen  new quality standards enforced  and most farmers' rights to sell to intervention curtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effective price cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct. EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen is currently working on proposals to provide direct income aids to farmers to cushion them from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy and encourage ministers to swallow the reform pill."
"2","West German Farm Minister Ignaz Kiechle who objected strongly to this week's European Community agreement to cut milk surpluses  conceded the accord would have the positive effect of stabilizing prices. According to the text of a speech made in the town of Trudering  near Munich  Kiechle said farmers' earnings would benefit from more stable prices. He said he had rejected the agreement because he preferred there to be no change in the EC's system of intervention. However  an objective analysis of the accord showed it contained positive elements  he said. No formal vote was taken on the EC accord  but a spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry in Bonn said Kiechle had made it clear in discussions in Brussels that he did not accept it.

With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year and a farm economy in the doldrums  Congress is pressing to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.  American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct competition with our producers   Sen. Don Nickles  an Oklahoma Republican  said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans. Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms  a conservative Republican from Idaho  have introduced legislation that would strictly limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus commodities or minerals. Current law requires the United States to vote against such loans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway. Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S. policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised at two Senate committee hearings last week. Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations   as a policy matter  we oppose loans for production of commodities in oversupply.  The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989. Nickles  Symms and others also have cited other loans such as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at low interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine loan was  really the only one you can point to and criticize.  Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S. funding of development banks by the amount of these loans. Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15  the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law. This year's proposal  called the Foreign Agricultural Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote against loans designed to increase production of surplus commodities and minerals. Also  the recipient countries would have to prove that the production  marketing and export of the commodities could be handled without government subsidy. If the loan is approved over U.S. objections  the United States would not increase or replenish funds for that institution until it agrees to stop making such loans. Objections to such loans have most often been raised by conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S. funding for these international development banks. But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised similar concerns among more moderate senators. Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker at the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing   Many say the banks are financing competition for American jobs.  She recommended that the United States use its participation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans as a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods. The administration opposes any legislation that would tie its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be instances in which a country needed the money to continue its moves toward U.S. policies in other areas. Baker said the United States would continue to use its leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization measures  often in the form of elimination of subsidies."
"2","Brazil has no set target forits coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas  President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets  he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations  but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags  he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers  exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy  but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions.  We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic   Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.  Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch   Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks  Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.  It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover   he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas  he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks  noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers  particularly Colombia  Mexico and Francophone African countries  but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts  although  no hypothesis has been abandoned.  Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance  as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags  more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that  although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop  the IBC would not make any estimate until late April."
"2","Britain appeared set for a new cash rowwith its European Community partners as evidence emerged that it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to radically alter the way the EC is financed. Analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released yesterday by the EC's executive Commission showed their full impact  were they in force this year  would have left Britain worse off by 545 mln European Currency Units. The proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member government after a debate expected to open next month. The Commission said they were necessary to prevent the EC from sliding once again into bankruptcy  and has described the current financing system as unfair and unacceptable. British dissatisfaction with the cost of EC membership has long been a source of friction  and diplomats said the proposals could well reopen the wound. This was despite a proposed correction of Britain's budget contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of the EC's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small size of its agricultural sector. Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy  Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements in the system which could also substantially increase their own EC payments  the main opposition was expected from Britain. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has made clear in recent statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present system  under which Britain is refunded two-thirds of its net payments to the EC  unless a fairer system is devised. The diplomats said Thatcher was unlikely to consider the proposed system as fair. The Commission's proposals would base a state's contribution on its gross national product  which the commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative wealth. The main element of the previous system was a share of value added tax collected in member states. The mechanism to compensate Britain for its inability to take up a higher proportion of EC farm expenditure will have to be paid for by the other 11 states. The Commission has also proposed to end repayments to all states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs duties on behalf of the EC."

"2","OPEC output in February was  well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas  the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying. The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result  of member countries' firm determination to defend the organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel  and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.  The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that  the reduction in total supplies  namely actual exports of crude oil and products  plus local deliveries in member countries  is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.   No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price  member countries are  without exception  strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail   the statement said.  The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price   the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official levels towards the end of the year  after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix  which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled  because of member countries' firm determination to defend the price (system)  agreed in December. Opec s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed  with no new date set  according to an official of the United Arab Emirates  which chairs the seven-state body. Other members are Algeria  Kuwait  Saudi Arabia  Libya  Nigeria and Qatar."

There have been some difficulties in those negotiations ... banks have sometimes been too rigid   Johnson said in response to a question during an address before the Eastern Economic Association  an academic group.  I think there have been potential breakdowns in that process   he said  adding that an actual breakdown  would be very unfortunate.  He declined to comment on the situation of specific nations and said it was not the Fed's role to become involved in such talks. However  he said it was  always a little bit risky  for a heavily indebted nation to seek refinancing without first negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on economic reforms. He added that he remains optimistic that current talks would be resolved successfully."
"2","The highly visible drama involving theyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies  thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions  Japanese and European research officials said. The officials  looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations  told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture  which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis  to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways  not least in terms of rare international cooperation  the September  1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture  in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance  but not necessarily central significance  the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place  the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.  You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now  and that was well before Plaza   he said. On February 25  1985  the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20  the Friday before Plaza  it was 242. Since then  despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action  the dollar trend has been down  down  down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which  but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986  Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms  five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January  Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S  against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms  but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.  The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe  where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms  which is what is important to them. Suddenly  instead of the U.S.  It is Europe that is laying the golden egg   said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales  but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base  compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms  a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance  and which will cause problems.  This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore  Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge   said Azusa Hayashi  Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry.  If you want my objective view  I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year  we asked for moderation in exports  and this year we may have to do so again   he said.

"2","Australia accused the U.S. of increasingprotectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade. Robert Arnott  Australia's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.  Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture   the Australian delegation said in a statement.  The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture   Arnott told the meeting. Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for  dubious protective measures  by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports. He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products  peanuts  cotton and sugar. Asked to comment  Michael Samuels  U.S. ambassador to the GATT  told Reuters:  These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy  part of our law when we joined the GATT .  We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all   Samuels added. Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September. Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking  tourism  insurance) is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods."
"2","Charles Haughey  leader of the Irishparty Fianna Fail  said if he becomes prime minister following last month's Irish general election  he will seek the advice of the EC Commission on management of the country's 24 billion punt foreign debt. Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17 poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt management was made to him today by Commission president Jacques Delors. Haughey said:  Delors assured me we could have full recourse to the Commission for advice  guidance and expert skills in dealing with our overall financial problems  particularily in the matter of debt management.  Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion punts a year  he added : If we could achieve any significant improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of servicing  it could have significant budgetary benefits.  He added that he would seek advice  not a Community loan. However  Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at favorable interest rates  notably for onlending to its farming sector.  It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before and we would look at it again   he said. Haughey said he regarded as  almost paramount  the maintenance of the punt's current position within the European Monetary System. He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight pct last August.  Until 1983  the policy of the Irish government was to was to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I believe that policy was right   Haughey said."
"2","Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukmansaid the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December  partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman  during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica  told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February  Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.  We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord   he said.  I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work   he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd  he said;  That could well be correct.  Opec s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was  well below  its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar  Nigeria  Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq  which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact  had produced less than had been anticipated  he said. Lukman said that some industry reports  may be correct  that in February  Nigeria propuced 75-100 000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota  Saudi Arabia 500 000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285 000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However  he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.  We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals   he said  adding that he expected it to go  up and up  even beyond official prices after early April. This is when  traditionally  there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait  Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also  some of Venezuela s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system  he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers  now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices  instead used their own stocks and ran them down to  dangerous levels   they would eventually have to buy Opec oil.  When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on   he said. Lukman  asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms  said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable  flexible and under constant review  not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far  no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting  now twice-postponed  was not a high priority for Opec at the moment.  At this time  we have to get our priorities right   he said.  The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working  not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.  But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system  a meeting would be called  he said."
"2","Top U.S. and European farm trade andgovernment representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production.  It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe  the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful   U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting  which ends tomorrow  demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the  imbalance and tensions of the world economy   the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices  allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand  and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids  proposed James Howard  Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA)  one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter  agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However   differentiated policy treatment is required  to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC  he said.  Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community   he said."
"2","Renewed confidence in OPEC's ability tolimit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above yesterday's closing prices  according to analysts. They also said the heating oil contract found additional support from a short-covering rally on the close. April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.  Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota   said Simon Greenshields  a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. News today  including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day  helped bouy prices  traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd. In addition to short-covering  heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude  as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance  traders said. Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon."
"2","Brazil's recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987. The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans  and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets  economists said.  That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation   Aldo Roldan  Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics  said. Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets  but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable.  Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates   Roldan said. The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil  where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs. But he added:  They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels.  Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee  and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance. Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence.  Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations  which others wanted changed   one senior coffee dealer said. The dealer  who declined to be named  said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks  he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer. Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales  the dealer said.  If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar  ninety or eighty cents   he said. New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb  while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit. President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute  Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas. Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts.  They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been   according to Richard Loewy  analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem  a good crop  plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop.  Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops   he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields.  We are going to see a very rapid decline  earlier than usual  this year in our (U.S.) exports   Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman  economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA)  said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes  versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate  offered to farmers who give crops as collateral  Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate  which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan.  We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export   Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration.  The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage   he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops  Melicias said it would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets  Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest  which could limit exports to the world market  analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments  and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar  will give it little room to stretch exports  they said. Brazil's other major crop  cocoa  is in its third year of surplus.  Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell  so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it   one analyst said.  If they come out as aggressive sellers  the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that   she added."
"2","OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrelsper day (bpd) of crude oil in February  down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986  the International Energy Agency said. A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December  but liftings were reduced from several countries  it said in its latest monthly oil market report. These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices  introduced from February 1  particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed  but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January  but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline  0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd  down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production  1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls)  16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls  8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls  net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies  0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains. Within the OECD  preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January  with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80 000 bpd  announced in support of OPEC."
"2","Mexico has temporarily suspendedoverseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the failure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting to agree a quota system at its latest meeting  the official Notimex news agency said.  We're just waiting a while for prices to improve   an unidentified Mexican trader told the agency. Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee produced in the year to last September  the source said. The country exports about 3.3 mln 60-kilo bags a year."
"2","Costa Rica's economy minister said hesees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas. Minister Luis Diego Escalante  who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute  said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing- nations by such major consumers as the United States  Britain and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london. Escalante told a news conference here he  carried the weight of the negotiations  at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting  Escalante said  on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity  once it has satisfied internal demand.  There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas   Escalante said. At the same time  there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential  he said. The current ICO quota system is  unfair and autocratic   Escalante said. Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand.  Be careful   he warned   there's not as much coffee in the world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust."
"2","Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funarolast night concluded this week's tour of European capitals having gleaned little in the way of concrete support from governments for his country's attempts to find a radical solution to its debt payments crisis. However  banking sources noted the existence of considerable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its commercial bank creditors  manifested in the widespread belief that adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems while patience might pave the way for an eventual reconciliation. Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks  followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions. The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration in Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter of 1986  along with a marked acceleration in inflation. Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs. Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week visited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government officials and agencies. This week they have sought official support in the U.K.  France  Germany  Switzerland and Italy. They have now decided to extend their tour  flying on Sunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials  with a possible visit to Canada before they return home. Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to government representatives  believing that problems with Brazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution. However  banking sources noted that their attempts to enlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been met almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks. This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for Brazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme  with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also recommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly."
"2","The failure of International CoffeeOrganization talks on the reintroduction of quotas has paralysed business on the Hamburg green coffee market in the past week  trade sources said. There was only sporadic activity for spot material  which was mainly requirement buying  they said  adding that pre-registered coffees were no longer available. They said they expected Brazil and Colombia to open export registrations for May shipment next week. However  the president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute  Jorio Dauster  said yesterday he had not yet decided when its registrations would reopen."
"2","The Belgian government  whichintroduced large-scale public spending reductions last year  has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988. The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy  a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet. The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy  with a particular emphasis on long-term rates. The team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts  which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs  and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform  better  on a broader basis  than at any time so far in the 1980s.  However  it adds that with lower inflation  stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989. The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986. The report says  The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government.  It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.  Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions  we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988   the report adds. The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation. It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows  which increased strongly in 1986. It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs."
"2","The world trade body GATT said itsnegotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for a ceiling on agricultural subsidies. GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq told reporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as the participants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on the table. He said the ceilings under discussion would only be applied to those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with high subsidy spending. Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed that its 24 member western industrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by a total average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from 1979-81. Within that total  the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs  Japan 24 billion  and the European Community 57 billion dlrs. Yves Berthelot  an official for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  said the suppression of agricultural subsidies in temperate countries  which would allow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domestic prices  would be difficult but inevitable."
"2","The world's major copper producing andconsuming countries have reached  a degree of consensus  on objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at reviewing the world copper market  officials said. Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed forum for copper have recommended that another session be held in September to consider further the nature of such a group  a spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said. The one-week meeting  which ended today  was held to examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group. The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to stabilise depressed world prices. Its objectives would include increasing market transparency  through improved statistics  and undertaking activities aimed at developing the copper market and contributing to improvement of demand. UNCTAD's spokesman said   Once they have agreed on detailed functions and objectives  then the way will be cleared to setting up the body."
"2","U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall.  OPEC is keeping its production down  and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers   said Daniel McKinley  oil analyst with Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co.  That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher   he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today  a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel.  Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota  but now both of those assumptions have come under question   McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area  or in industrialized nations  were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes  or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike  which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price.  This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March)   the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output  traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also  an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.  This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250 000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues  the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there   McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes  such as North Sea Brent  were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries  trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke  chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management  said OPEC production was lower  because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.  He added   The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota  and the drain on the Saudis will continue  forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price   he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices  traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent  which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs  far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.  There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals  which are below official prices and this is probably being resold   one international trader said."
"2","The U.N. Centre on TransnationalCorporations has issued a report containing guidelines and recommendations for negotiating natural gas clauses in agreements between transnational petroleum corporations and host countries. The U.N. said the report was aimed at promoting petroleum exploration in areas perceived as being gas prone. The 49-page report contains an in-depth examination of the problems of gas developoment and looks at different ways in which contractual terms might deal with the risks in gas development associated with pricing  marketing and volume."
"2","Higher oil prices and stronger thanexpected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook  financial analysts said. The increase of 319 000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170 000 to 200 000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday  they noted.  I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101   said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range  which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists. But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday. Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses.  I tend to go along with the double top scenario   said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico. Rico noted that the possible formation  along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume  were negative signals. Despite what could be a negative chart outlook  Leiner remains cautiously optimistic  and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week. The optimistic outlook  as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term  is based on an improving inflation outlook. With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy   the inflation outlook is improving   Leiner said  and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices. Still  Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook. Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices  and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.  The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon   said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer. The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely  media induced   Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas   oil stocks are at tremendously high levels.  Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay  oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February  he said  and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices."
"2","OPEC member Ecuador adopted austeritymeasures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by a strong earthquake. Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct. A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports  declaring force majeure. Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast. The quake on Thursday  which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale  killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito. Ecuador had recently been pumping 260 000 barrels per day. The government's austerity measures ban the sale of aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines. Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and holidays and limited sales on weekdays  an Energy and Mines Ministry communique said."
"2","As a British government investigation gotunder way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life  experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7 951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners  Townsend Thoresen  said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise  but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present.  Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened   he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued  maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called  RoRo  ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship  built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980  was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge.  As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability   he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.  If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship   he added."
"2","The World Bank approved a 100-mln-dlr20-year loan to help modernise the machine tool industry in Shanghai  the New China News Agency said. It quoted a World Bank press release in Shanghai as saying that the loan would help modernise 18 plants and research institutes owned by the Shanghai Machine Tool Works and the Shanghai Machine Tool Corp to import manufacturing technology and to develop training programmes for managers and engineers. With a five-year grace period  its interest rate is currently estimated at 7.92 pct but would be variable  it said  without indicating with what it would vary."
"2","Any European Community decision toliberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry  said Ammar Siamwalla  an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market. The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca  absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990. Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty. Ammar  head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI  suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops. He said:  If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices  the tapioca market there will disappear completely.  He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies."
"2","The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade  face slower economic growth  and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987  the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year  compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences  and Japan  hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988  due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast  to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year  as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets  and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988  it said.  This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing   the EIU said.  Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan  or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy   it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.  Thus far they have been willing   the EIC said  adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis  dollar interest rates would have to soar  bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis  it said. On trade  the EIU said prospects for 1987 look  increasingly sick.  Import growth  forecast in December at 4.5 pct  is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988  it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor  with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December  the EIU said. On the export side  it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe  while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower  more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan  raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986."
"2","West Germany takes  very seriously  therecent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels  Finance Ministry State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said. Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here  Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies. But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels.  We're taking this sentence very seriously   he said. Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting. He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect. Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out  appropriate and timely  action if necessary. Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc. The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity. Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary. He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected  while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year."
"2","Uganda  Africa's second largest coffeeproducer  was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London  the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board  CMB  said.  This has not been good for coffee producers  more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee   J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation  ICO  talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas  which were suspended in Feburary last year  on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports  over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags  according to sources close to the CMB. The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags. For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry. The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower. In Dar es Salaam  Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks.  It is only the middlemen who will benefit  he said. Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting within two months  saying   Once tempers have cooled and delegations have had time to report back to their headquarters  common sense will prevail."
"2","The suspension of Ecuador's crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months  a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline  which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline  the official  who did not want to be named  told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador  where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador  a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  was recently pumping about 260 000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude  about 50 000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel  another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year  it exported an average of 173 500 bpd  according to the central bank. However  Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline  costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs  to hook up with a Colombian pipeline  the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador  squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986  had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January  about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs  the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas  President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May  Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program  he said."
"2","The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade  face slower economic growth  and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987  the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year  compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences  and Japan  hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988  due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast  to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year  as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets  and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988  it said.  This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing   the EIU said.  Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan  or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy   it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.  Thus far they have been willing   the EIC said  adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis  dollar interest rates would have to soar  bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis  it said. On trade  the EIU said prospects for 1987 look  increasingly sick.  Import growth  forecast in December at 4.5 pct  is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988  it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor  with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December  the EIU said. On the export side  it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe  while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower  more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan  raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. However  rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984  the EIU said. After a rise of 18 pct in 1986  the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988  it said. It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986."
"2","Morocco  buoyed by an economic turnaroundand last week's Paris Club debt rescheduling  is likely to obtain over 100 mln dlrs worth of development aid at a meeting with donors beginning here tomorrow  John Shilling  director of the World Bank's Moroccan division  said.  A certain optimism has appeared in the economy to the effect that things are no longer impossible and Morocco can get out of its problems ... We are aiming for 100 mln Special Drawing Rights and if we can get more it will be put to good use   he told a news conference. The agreement last week with the Paris Club of western creditors rescheduling over 10 years 900 mln dlrs worth of official debt due by mid-1988  together with an accord late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt  had already encouraged donors to increase aid  he added. Debt sources said a World Bank concessional loan of around 200 mln dlrs to help rationalise Morocco's public sector was likely to be agreed in Washington soon."
"2","About 8 000 West German farmers marchedthrough the northern city of Kiel today in a protest against European Community (EC) agricultural policies  organisers said. The demonstrators burned straw effigies of the two West German members of the EC's 17-man Commission  Karl-Heinz Narjes and Alois Pfeiffer  and demanded their removal from office. Speakers at a rally also called on the government to take a tougher stance in dealings with the Commission. The protest was the latest of several by West German farmers against Commission proposals to cut EC farm spending.The farmers say the proposals will put many of them out of business."

"2","The chairman of the conference on a newInternational Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA)  Manaspas Xuto of Thailand  said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week. The INRA renegotiation conference  which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months   I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned.   It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week  since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed.  He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls  aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA)  were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA  originally due to expire in October 1985  was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon  head of the Malaysian delegation  said he was cautiously optimistic  that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled.  Without INRA  he added  prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality  he said   There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement."
"2","The World Bank intends to bringborrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end  World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said. He told a news conference that rates in the U.S.  Japan  West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows.  The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates   he said. The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when  where and how much to borrow  Rotberg said. Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years. Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market  it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation  Rotberg said. Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding  only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency. Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case  it would not adopt new instruments. The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before  Rotberg said. However  for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants. The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959  he said."
"2","Disposable income available to peopleemployed in European Community agriculture rose 0.9 pct in 1986 after an 8.8 pct fall the previous year  the EC statistics agency Eurostat said in a report. It said income available to farm holders and members of their family working on the holding rose 2.5 pct after a 13.9 pct fall in 1985. Eurostat said the reason for the increases was higher production  with a 1.6 pct increase in crop output and a 0.7 pct rise in animal products compared with 1985. However  Eurostat added a 1.6 pct fall in prices for animal products was more than offset by a 3.1 pct increase in those for crops. It said income changes varied widely across the EC in 1986. Disposable income of all those employed in agriculture rose 12.9 pct in West Germany but fell 7.8 pct in Denmark  while income available to holders and their families rose 17.0 pct in Britain but fell 9.7 pct in Ireland."

"2","Central bankers said theywere generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels. Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  which reviewed the agreement  they also welcomed interest rates cuts in France and today's drop in British rates.  One top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy. The central bankers  who spoke on the condition they not be named  said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10 countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus  the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund  on the IMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular  they discussed Brazil's debt moratorium. But there was no sense of urgency  they said  and Brazil had made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central banks."
"2","French maize producers will ask the ECCommission to grant permanent maize export rebates following the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four years  the French maize producers association  AGPM  said. The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500 000 tonnes of French maize  of which rebates for around 100 000 tonnes have been granted. The request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500 000 tonnes  the AGPM said. The association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations  adding that the Soviet Union  which has important maize needs  is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500 000 tonnes of French maize. The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against 10.40 mln in 1985/86."
"2","a confidential world bank report on theperuvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to quickly lead to inflation. The report  published today by an economic monthly  the peru report  said the success of president alan garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct gross domestic product growth  represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long.  Government officials had no immediate comment on the report  which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct  its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties.  an early renewal of inflationary pressures  linked to monetary expansion  exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls  appears not improbable   it added."
"2","European Community finance ministersdiscussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic. The Commission  the EC's executive authority  two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn. It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports. But diplomats said several member states  led by West Germany  Britain and France  felt the forecast was too gloomy  especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels.  Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic   said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens  who chaired the meeting. The Commission  which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent  has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe. But two top German officials  State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer  told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy. The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France  while Italy  Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth."
"2","President Reagan signed an orderallowing sales of U.S. nuclear fuel to the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) to continue for a further year  even though they do not comply with a 1978 U.S. law. Under the law  which is designed to combat the spread of nuclear weapons  foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel must get American consent to any reprocessing. The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11 rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear cooperation agreements  signed more than 20 years ago  to conform with the 1978 law. Since 1978 the U.S.-EURATOM nuclear coooperation accords have been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders. State Department officials said negotiations had made more progress in the last two years after the United States had offered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement  rather than requiring EURATOM to have U.S. consent for each fuel delivery. In notifying Congress of today's order extending U.S.-EURATOM nuclear cooperation  Reagan said:  A disruption of nuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance of progress in our talks with EURATOM related to our agreements  it would also cause serious problems in our relationships.  He said further progress in talks with EURATOM was expected this year."
"2","A 3.6 billion dlr plan to rid theEuropean Community (EC) of one mln tonnes of surplus butter is in doubt as Spain and Portugal refuse to drop their opposition to the scheme  diplomats said. The plan  proposed by the Community's executive Commission  aims to level most of the EC's huge and costly butter mountain by disposing of a total of 1.04 mln tonnes this year and next. But the officials said Spain and Portugal  which joined the 12-nation bloc at the beginning of last year  continued to oppose the scheme at a meeting of EC finance ministers here. They argued they should not have to pay for the disposal of surpluses created before they became EC members. The plan  already approved by farm ministers despite opposition from Madrid and Lisbon  had been sent to finance ministers for final approval. But the diplomats said the finance ministers instead referred it back to the Commission  asking it to study possible ways to solve the row as soon as possible. They said Spain and Portugal indicated they may go to the European Court of Justice over the issue if the Commission did not come up with a satisfactory solution. The scheme has also run into criticism from the EC's financial watchdog  the Court of Auditors. The Court has said the plan is unsound because the Commission wants member states to foot the bill until it starts reimbursing them in four annual instalments from 1989. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal backed the court's view and also complained that  under complex financial agreements worked out when they joined the EC  they would get less back later than if they were reimbursed now. Commission sources said it appeared the two countries were holding out in a bid to squeeze some form of compensation out of their partners but it was unclear how much longer they would continue to block the scheme."

The world bank report said the government's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions  overvaluation of the currency  balance of payments disequilibrium  reserve losses  and sharply diminished creditworthiness. It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit   the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments.

The government's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors  among its main traditional exports  suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability  it added."
"2","Iranian Oil Minister GholamrezaAqazadeh is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to discuss oil prices and the general market situation  Iranian officials accompanying him said. He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba. Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in Riyadh  where he met Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazir. The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good. Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices. OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8 mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon  Algeria and Libya. The Iranian news agency  IRNA  quoted him as saying before leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make oil prices permanently stable."
"2","King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wantsoil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied:  Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.  Non-OPEC countries  must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone   he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices  King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure  due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia  the world's largest oil exporter  was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer  Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output. The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield  he said."
"2","Japanese car makers will curb theirexports to the European Community (EC) following an unofficial directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  automobile industry sources said. Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to be at most unchanged from last year's 1.10 mln units and may even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic growth and increasing trade friction. Last week  MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to exercise prudence in exporting to Europe. Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January to build up depleted vehicle inventories  industry sources said. Japan's vehicle exports to Europe in January rose 38 pct from a year earlier to 174 133 units. In December  exports fell 70.4 pct year-on-year as makers curbed shipments to meet an earlier directive from MITI to limit 1986 exports  they said."

They said approved lending in 1986/87 (July-June) is expected to total 1.4 billion dlrs  of which 550 mln will come from the IDA and 850 mln from the World Bank. World Bank figures show approved lending to China by the two bodies amounted to 1.137 billion in 1985/86  1.102 billion in 1984/85 and 1.04 billion in 1983/84. The bankers said that 1.2 billion dlrs had been disbursed by the end of 1986 and China's disbursement record compares very favourably with that of other countries. They said Japan has so far been the main source of bilateral concessional assistance for China  followed by West Germany  Canada  Italy  Australia and Britain. But China will probably find that such funds will not increase  except for those from Japan and the World Bank  given other claims  particularly from sub-Saharan African countries which cannot raise commercial credits  they added."

However  a spokesman for the Commission confirmed the offers had been made to intervention agencies in various member states  and said it would now take up to three weeks for the agencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation. The spokesman said that under current regulations  the EC would have to accept all the offers if there were no technical problems. The spokesman said the Commission would only have to reimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugar after the product was sold out of intervention stores at a later date. He said that at present there was virtually no sugar held in intervention stores. Last year  45 000 tonnes were sold into intervention and during the 1984-85 campaign 108 000 tonnes."
"2","Traders here and in Paris said theresults of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast because of plans by a group of French  West German  Dutch and Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into intervention. London traders said bids for licences have been reported between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that range  possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus. Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of between 43 and 43.50 Ecus. Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export  the likely tonnage is expected to be very small  the London traders said  while the French sources declined to estimate volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales into intervention in protest against EC export policies. Last week licences for 60 500 tonnes were awarded at a maximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus."
"2","Borrowing on the international capitalmarkets rose moderately in February with 25.9 billion dlrs of medium and long term funds raised  up 1.5 billion from January and up 3.2 billion from February last year  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said. Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 20.8 billion dlrs  some 2.8 billion more than in January  the OECD said in its latest monthly report. But the market for floating rate notes (FRNs) saw further serious difficulties and the volume of new offerings was only 1.4 billion dlrs against a 1986 monthly average of 4.2 billion. However  the OECD said  issues of straight bonds and especially equity-related issues continued at a brisk pace. As in January  exchange rate uncertainties had a major impact on the currency composition of new bond issues  with issues in dlrs totalling only 6.5 billion against a monthly average of over 10 billion dlrs in 1986.  The share of the U.S. Dollar in total external bond offerings has fallen below 32 pct this year - the lowest figure in the present decade   the report said  but added that the market has absorbed a record volume of yen offerings. In the syndicated credit market  the volume of new loans declined to 3.9 billion dlrs in February from 4.7 billion in January. Activity on the market for note issuance and other back-up facilities continued to be particularly subdued with a total of only 1.2 billion dlrs completed in February  some 500 mln dlrs less than the already depressed figure for January.

"2","European CommunityCommission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan for changes to Community financing. In a speech to the European Parliament  Delors said some EC leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves pruning their own spending. Others called for major spending cut in the EC's controversial farm policy in order to free money for regional and social development. The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a second two-year term. Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the EC should be based on their gross national product instead of on the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of sharing the financial burden. He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about increased payments  he had told some heads of government the Community needs more money. Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to reform the EC farm policy  which currently accounts for over two thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget. We have to ask for sacrifices but we have to create a future for those farmers.  He added   I was forced to say to some heads of government - Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when you are asking for a common market in goods and services?  EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine internal market in industrial products and services. Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes."
"2","The International Monetary Fund haswarned Israel in a report that a continued rapid rise in wages could undo the achievements of its economic stabilization program in controlling hyperinflation. An IMF delegation  which visited Israel this week  issued an interim report praising Israel's success in slashing inflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year without triggering mass unemployment. But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of the perils awaiting countries who did not follow up on stabilization programs.  Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progress in reducing inflation and the present level of employment   the IMF said. The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of Israel Governor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim that higher wages  government overspending and a consumer boom were rekindling inflation.  Though wage developments and the reacceleration of inflation are worrisome  there is still time to put the stabilization program back on track   it said. The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wage negotiations next month. Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said real growth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct  following a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when the government's economic stabilisation programme was introduced. Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise to around 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might be necessary later in the year  following the 9.75 pct devaluation against the dollar in January. Bar-Shavit also said the government was implementing a policy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancing the budget. The IMF report said monetary policy was relaxed too fast last year and it supported the Bank of Israel's raising of interest rates in the last month."
"2","OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment tofixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices  its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here  After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC  I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.  Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.  We are in a position to re-confirm that  despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary  ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February   Lukman  who is Nigerian oil minister  said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900 000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level.  The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs   Lukman said. He said the 900 000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members  adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100 000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement  while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified  Lukman said.  If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed  we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs   the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.  Furthermore  no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to   he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied  We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.  Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude.  We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year   Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers  which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices  but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market.  We are quite confident  however  that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands  the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly   he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic  but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster."
"2","The European Court in Luxembourg hasruled a so-called  Christmas butter  scheme  under which surplus stocks were sold off cheaply  did not infringe European Community (EC) rules  a Commission spokesman said. The spokesman said the Court rejected a case brought by three European margarine manufacturers which argued the EC Executive Commission did not have the power to launch the scheme in October 1984 without approval from EC ministers. The plan was aimed at offloading 200 000 tonnes of butter from a one mln tonne stockpile at a specially reduced price of 1.6 European currency units per kilogram."
"2","Japanese car makers will curb theirexports to the European Community (EC) following an unofficial directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  automobile industry sources said. Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to be at most unchanged from last year's 1.10 mln units and may even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic growth and increasing trade friction. Last week  MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to exercise prudence in exporting to Europe."
"2","Ecuador's deputy energy ministerFernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake  officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude  to be repaid in kind after 180 days  to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota  set at 210 000 barrels per day for first half 1987.  All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production   a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired  officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level  officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota  or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter  and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake."
"2","The West German intervention board saidabout 100 000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into intervention so far. A spokesman  speaking from Frankfurt  told Reuters offers have increased recently but contracts have not yet been concluded. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to intervention boards in various member states. The intervention board spokesman in Frankfurt said   One million tonnes is an awful lot and the Community's coffers are almost empty. This could turn into a serious political problem.  West German trade sources said they believed the one mln tonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention would have a neutral market impact overall."
"2","Negotiators at a United Nationsconference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards reaching an agreement  delegates said. The conference  which began Monday  is widely seen as the final effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) before the current one expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. This is the fourth such conference in nearly two years. Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism. Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 months as at present  a proposal currently rejected by producers. And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic  producers have resisted reducing the role of the International Rubber Organization Council in the price adjustment procedure. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has said it was  imperative  to settle outstanding issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week."
"2","The European Community (EC) expresseddisquiet over protectionist moves in the United States to limit imports of textiles and said it would retaliate immediately if EC exports were hit. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq had written to his U.S. Counterpart  special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter  outlining the concerns of the 12-nation Community. The draft legislation under consideration by Congress would impose permanent quotas on products entering the U.S. and seek to limit any increase to a growth in the overall trade."
"2","The overall area devoted to sugarbeet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986  West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year  Licht said  but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha  against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates  in 1 000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets)  are  Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118)  Denmark 69 (69)  France 419 (421)  Greece 35 (44)  Ireland 36 (38)  Italy 270 (275)  Netherlands 129 (138)  Portugal 1 (1)  Spain 192 (190)  U.K. 200 (201)  West Germany 385 (399)  Austria 32 (28)  Finland 30 (31)  Sweden 51 (52)  Switzerland 15 (14)  Turkey 355 (340)  Yugoslavia 160 (136). Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows  USSR 3400 (3440)  Albania 10 (9)  Bulgaria 52 (50)  Czechoslovakia 195 (196)  East Germany 210 (205)  Hungary 108 (96)  Poland 460 (440)  Romania 295 (280). On the basis of average yields this year  Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes  raw value  down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season  thanks to favourable weather  and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields  EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87  while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87."
"2","France supports the European Commission'splans for a European Community (EC) fats and oils tax but objects to some of its oilseeds proposals  Yves Van Haecke  an aide to French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume said. He told a general assembly of France's Oilseeds Federation (FFCOP) that a suppression of monthly increases of oilseed support prices  for example  was unacceptable. French oilseeds experts added the principle of a single tax regardless of varying quality was clumsy and capable of unneccessarily alienating exporters such as the U.S."
"2","The European Community Commission hastold EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale into intervention stocks to protest against its policies  Commission sources said.  Our position is that we are not willing to discuss the problems of market prices at a time when traders are making threats   one source said. The sources said the Commission's view was made clear at a meeting of its sugar management committee today. They said French  West German and Dutch officials had informed the committee that traders in their countries intended to sell just over 850 000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention stocks. The Commission riposted by signalling that it would sell the sugar sold into intervention back onto the EC market by tender  a move that would push down prices. The sources said French traders planned to sell 775 000 tonnes into intervention stocks  West German traders 7 500 tonnes and Dutch traders 2 500."

He said revenue should not be raised by taxing the consumer and called the proposal  repugnant."
"2","Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oilexport quota by 100 000 barrels per day to 310 000 to compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake  deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said. Santos Alvite  who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador  did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier  Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300 000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50 000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market. Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao."
"2","Indonesian coffee exporters arepreparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas  the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia  the world's third largest producer  is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.  But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position  we can never bridge the gap   Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries  along with Costa Rica  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Honduras  India  Papua New Guinea and Peru  which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil  which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme  blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda  an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations  said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia  the world's second largest producer  but gave no details.  Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one  they will suffer if the present market stays like it is   Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S.  Japan  the Netherlands  West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed  realistic criteria.  The breakaway group believes the old quota system  which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports  does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced  producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S.  The largest consumer  are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system  Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87  ending September 30  is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360 000 tonnes  he said. He said stocks  at 90 000 tonnes  were about average for the time of year."
"2","Dutch sugar traders deny involvementin a plan to offer more than 850 000 tonnes of sugar to intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices  traders told Reuters. Although some 2 500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to intervention in the Netherlands  Dutch producers and traders said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by the Belgian industry.  We sympathise with the actions of the French  West German and Belgian traders and producers  but we are not party to it   a spokesman said. EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned to sell 775 000 tonnes into intervention stocks  West German traders 75 000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2 500. Dutch trade sources gave the same figure for France  but estimated up to 110 000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers. The Dutch spokesman added   The weekly export tender policy and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry  and this is the only way in which they can really register their protest.  These are desperate actions  but we believe that most of this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week breathing space allowed."
"2","Australia expects meat and livestockexports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this year  managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp  Peter Frawley  said. He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and less competition from the European Community should lead in the Gulf area to higher beef sales  which dropped from 33 000 tonnes in 1980 to just 2 300 tonnes last year.  In the last three to four months there has been a resurgence of inquiries   he said. Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market potential. On beef exports  he said a 50 pct drop in European Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help Australian sales. The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these markets  where the Australian trade was the natural source of supply  and Australia was  now back in   Frawley said. He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the Middle East market for livestock  which accounts for two-thirds of meat export value to the area  would be maintained. He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand for fresh meat. The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia  the biggest single market  was 3 214 159 compared with 2 939 226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain fell  however. Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean. Other than livestock  Australia's overall meat sales to the Middle East rose to 72 374 tonnes in 1986 from 52 403 tonnes the previous year  largely due to the sale of 25 790 tonnes of mutton and lamb to Iran. Australia sold 9 824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a barter provision  but Iran had paid in full in cash. Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were currently under way  with Iran again seeking credit and barter provisions  he said. Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he predicted this would continue.  The Middle East  and the Gulf in particular  is now Australia's largest market for lamb  chilled and flown in. Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh  young product   he said."

"2","Most Japanese companies have decided notto renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels  industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel  compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter  the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185 000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts  but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10 000 to 15 000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April  but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices.  If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price   one Japanese refiner said.  We don't intend to put pressure on them   he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower  oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April  adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement  while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd  supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs  spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said   At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC  particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem  and I'm beginning to trust their ability.  Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday   Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.  He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products  reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said   The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.  &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"
"2","The EC Commission said it wasadopting an  open attitude  about whether a system of production quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods. In a statement  the Commission reiterated its view that the industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity by 1990. It had previously said the quota system  started in 1980  should be wound up completely by the end of next year. The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing quotas  which cover almost 70 pct of all output  saying almost all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market."
"2","Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen toits lowest level in more than a year  giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel  as agreed by Opec last December  oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait  compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world  which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia  the world s largest oil exporter  was insisting on getting Opec official prices  even at the cost of lower production  the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs.  Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions   he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday  down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers  the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil  Exxon  Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices  the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve  the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations."
"2","The Brazilian Coffee Institute IBC  is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest  trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers  producers  exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization  ICO  export quotas.  The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely   one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday  March 19  and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts  bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced  the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets  they said. They noted that on February 16  the eve of a planned increase in the quota  April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export  a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before  Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.  The problem would be how to limit sales   one exporter said. Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However  the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter  but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced  although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year  Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln  the sources added. However  the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities  as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts  thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags  enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks  they added."

"2","Morocco is likely to get an extra aidpackage exceeding 100 mln Special Drawing Rights (126 mln dlrs) in 1987 following a three-day Consultative Group meeting of donors chaired by the World Bank  Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Berada said. Berrada said most of the extra aid sought to complete high priority investments in agriculture  education  and public health had already been secured  and additional sums were likely to emerge from forthcoming bilateral meetings with donors. A World Bank statement said the Consultative Group meeting attended by 15 donor countries and agencies noted with satisfaction a marked improvement in Morocco's economic performance and urged it to continue recent adjustment efforts. It added that the Group saw as realistic Morocco's medium-term goal of restoring creditworthiness on financial markets  and agreed to reconvene in a year to discuss Morocco's five year development strategy for 1988-92  introduced in its broad outlines at this week's meeting. Morocco reached an agreement here last week with the Paris Club of western creditor governments to reschedule over 10 years the 900 mln dlrs of debt due by mid 1988. That followed an agreement late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt. Morocco's foreign debt currently totals 14 billion dlrs  Berrada said  adding that Morocco intended to stop rescheduling its debts  and pay them off instead. He told Reuters the forthcoming five-year development plan  designed to avoid the negative effects of adjustment without growth  could require further aid of 700 or 800 mln dlrs."

"2","It could be months before majorassistance is provided for Earthquake-stricken Ecuador  although the International Monetary Fund and the development banks have already taken the first steps  monetary sources and U.S. officials said. They said the IMF had informed the Ecuadorean government that it was prepared  under its emergency system  to provide about 50 mln dlrs  or about 25 per cent of the country's quota in the agency  but it is up to Ecuador to request the money. At the same time  the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have dispatched missions to the region hit by last Thursday's quake to determine what the country's needs are and how they can speed up disbursement of funds from programs already approved. The World Bank estimates that of the over one billion dlrs it has approved for Ecuador in recent years  some 277 mln dlrs has yet to be disbursed and a portion of this could  potentially  be made available. The bank said that the programs it has approved are for rural development  agriculture  water and sewerage  electrical power and others. If the assistance that is needed can be fit into these general categories  the funds could be then provided for from expedited disbursements"
"2","There has been slight progress towardsreaching a rubber pact  the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement  INRA  Manaspas Xuto of Thailand  said.  There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet   he said. The conference  which began Monday  is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference  the fourth such meeting in nearly two years  Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price  as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price  and the  may buy  (or  may sell ) and  must buy  (or  must sell ) levels without changing the  lower indicative price  (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price  set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo  and of the  lower indicative price  if the buffer stock  currently 360 000 tonnes  rises to 450 000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present  and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present  if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months  the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that  in these circumstances  the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact."
"2","The United States subsidises itsagricultural industry much more than the European Community  according to an internal USDA report  Marcel Cazale  President of the French Maize Producers' Association (AGPM)  said. He told reporters that according to what he described as a  confidential  report prepared by the USDA which he had seen  the US took the leading place regarding agricultural subsidies  ahead of the EC. Cazale said according to the report  Argentina and Australia were the only countries not to subsidise their agriculture at all  or only by a small amount. Cazale said in Argentina subsidies were granted for exports  but for a very small amount  while in Australia subsidies were also only for exports  amounting to 15 to 30 pct. But Cazale said Australian agriculture received disguised aid to the extent that fuel and fertilisers benefited from tax reductions  and transport  electricity and telephones in the sector had special tariffs. He did not elaborate."
"2","The World Bank said it has approveda 140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country's dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own petroleum resources. The bank said the loan will be used to boost production by injecting gas in the partially depleted Assam oil fields and to assist exploration in other areas  including drilling 10 exploratory wells. The bank said the recipient of the 20-year loan will be Oil India Ltd (OIL)  which is the smaller of two public Indian petroleum exploration and production companies."
"2","Colombia intends to improve themarketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices  finance minister Cesar Gaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price  or reintegro  of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York  Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.  In the first stage  we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy   he said. Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas  suspended in February 1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume.  Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee  between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos)  and will do so without an agreement among producers   he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports  or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles   because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market.  Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria's words  Jorge Cardenas  manager of the national coffee growers' federation  said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.  There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future   he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved. Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue  Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear. He said Brazil's current quota  reflects the reality of the market  allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand   but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it. Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible  which did not happen."

"2","The U.S. Has given further detailsof an action program announced yesterday aimed at helping sub-Saharan Africa overcome hunger and economic problems  senior U.S. Offficials said. Under the new program  a 500-mln dlr Development Fund for Africa will be set up to consolidate most of the aid money going to the continent to replace the large number of bilateral accounts currently in existence. Chester Crocker  assistant secretary of state for Africa  said he believed Congress will favour the program  which stems from a U.N. Conference on Africa's economic problems. The 500-mln dlr fund  coupled with an additional 100 mln dlrs in food aid  would surpass Congress' 1986 vote of 483 mln dlrs for equivalent programs  officials said. Washington is also increasing its funding to the International Development Agency (IDA)  the World Bank's soft loan affiliate  and is seeking a greater share of a bigger fund for Africa  they said. Officials said under the last IDA replenishment Africa got 37 pct of 8.7 billion dlrs  but the Reagan administration wants this increased to 45-50 pct of 12.8 billion dlrs in new funds."
"2","Bangladesh will seek additional moneyfrom the World Bank to finance industrial development which is facing a capital shortage and a lack of expertise  Finance Ministry officials said. They said the government had revised downward its Annual Development Programme budget for this fiscal year by seven pct to 44.4 billion Taka. A team will visit Washington next month for talks with World Bank executives and to ask for 200 mln dlrs from the bank's Industrial Programme Credit scheme  they said. The new money would be in addition to nearly two billion dlrs aid which the World Bank  other leading agencies and donor countries are expected to offer Bangladesh for the year from July at their Paris meeting next month. They offered 1.85 billion dlrs to the country in 1986/87. The Annual Development Programme budget has been cut mainly because of poor tax collection and a fall in public and private sector industrial investment  the Finance Ministry officials said. They said they expect a two pct growth in the industrial sector this year  against a target of five pct and a growth of 1.5 pct in 1985. They gave no further details."
"2","Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto saidhe sees the oil market continuing bullish  with underlying demand expected to rise later in the year. He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a two-day meeting of South-East Asian Energy Ministers that he saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel.  The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth quarters   Subroto said. Asked about the prospect for oil prices  he said:  I think they will stabilise around 18 dlrs  although there is a little turbulence ...   Of course the spot price will fluctuate  but the official price will remain at 18 dlrs   he added."

We are deliberately defending the price  so OPEC production is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment   he stated. Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel  he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June.  We will discuss the market situation then   he added. He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because  there is no need for the meeting.  He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week."

"2","Spanish farmers took their tractors tothe roads today and blocked a border crossing with France in a protest against the Socialist government's EC policies  officials said. Protestors set cars ablaze and cut off traffic in the Rioja wine growing district  while they blocked roads with tractor convoys in other northern regions such as Saragossa  where 5 000 farmers joined the demonstrations. Farmers blockaded the border crossing with France at La Junquera near Barcelona  refusing to allow lorries from other European countries to enter Spain. Spanish farmers have been protesting for the past two weeks to demand a better deal within the Community. The farm protest came in the wake of demonstrations last night in over 30 cities in which workers marched for wage rises and against job losses. But the turnout  regarded as a dress rehearsal for a general strike next month  disappointed the communist-led Workers Commissions union organisers. The ruling Socialist Party's trade union arm  the General Workers' Union  did not join in. More than 20 strikes are planned for this month and next in the transport sector  with stoppages at the state-owned Iberia and Aviaco airlines and RENFE railways."
"2","The continued strength of the Swiss francagainst the dollar will largely deprive Swiss exporters of the benefits of the upturn in the world economy  a quarterly study by the Economics Department said. It said the export industry would scarcely get a boost from the upturn in the economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  and predicted declines in new orders for highly export-orientated firms. However  domestic demand  which stagnated in the last quarter of 1986  would resume its growth  fuelled by higher real incomes and buoyant consumer sentiment  it said. The study  which was drawn up by the department's Commission for Economic Questions  said industrial production would scarcely increase  with most firms apparently happy with current numbers of workers. However  an increase in labour demand in the service sector should help push up total employment  it said. The Commission also predicted an increase in inflation from current low levels."
"2","The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe  economists say. But many economists say the system  which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands  remains in its infancy. Its new currency  the European Currency Unit (Ecu)  has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday  the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers  ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase  originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up  decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters.  The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common   said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies  accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness  its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months  as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies  the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar  it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise  the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc  Italian lira  the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound  still a major world currency  outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections  due by mid-1988. Meanwhile  the system's last realignment  the 11th since it was set up  prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change.  Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level   said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence  they predict."
"2","The U.S. Agriculture Department'sExport Enhancement Program  EEP  contributed to the recent agreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of global trade talks  according to the General Accounting Office. GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told a Senate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased the cost of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy. However  there is little reason to believe that once EEP expires  gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the program will be sustained in targeted markets  he said. Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making it across-the-board would eliminate charges of discrimination by traditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC  but antagonize non-subsidizing exporters."

The meat industry will seek to have the U.S. government retaliate against EC and Korean exports if their complaints are upheld."

It would be inconceivable that we would allow the EC continued access to the U.S. market while they attempt to halt our meat exports to the EC   the March 9 letter said."
"2","Negotiators at a United Nationsconference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact  conference chairman Manaspas Xuto said.  We have resolved major differences of opinion   he told Reuters. Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord  to replace the current one which expires in October. Xuto said:  I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption  since the talks began last Monday.  It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement   he added. The renegotiation conference  under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price)  the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300 000 tonnes  the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400 000 tonnes  the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150 000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock  currently 360 000 tonnes  rose to 450 000 tonnes. The proposal  initiated by the U.S.  Was withdrawn last night  setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five- year pact had failed  the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock. The United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Italy and Britain are the major consumers. UNCTAD's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988."
"2","World Bank Vice-President DavidKnox said creditor banks must become more flexible in providing funds for Latin American debtor nations.  The international creditor banks must make their position more flexible  ensuring a flow of funds for Latin American countries  especially the most indebted   Knox told the semi- official newsagency Telam. Knox said Brazil's decision last month to suspend payments on a large portion of its foreign debt had shocked the creditor banks. The banks were  in no hurry to provide funds for the debtor nations   he said. But he said the situation of debtor nations transferring funds to the developed should be reversed.  It must be the other way round  to make development in indebted states possible.  He said the World Bank was supplying special lines of credit to make up for this inflexibility on the part of the banks. It had increased its involvement in development projects by 60 pct in the last two years  he said. Knox said banks would grant Argentina loans of up to two billion dlrs over the next two years to help the country meet growth targets. Argentina is currently negotiating a 2.15 billion dlr loan with creditor banks for 1987."

"2","The International Monetary Fund (IMF)has assured Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi it will continue to give his country maximum support  the official Kenya News Agency KNA said. It said IMF Managing director Michel Camdessus made the pledge during talks with Moi in Washington yesterday. Earlier this month  Moi told parliament Kenya would face a difficult balance of payments situation this year as a result of falling income from coffee exports and a higher oil import bill. Foreign bankers in Nairobi have said a new loan agreement with the IMF would be Kenya's first option for dealing with the expected deficit. According to KNA  Moi thanked Camdessus for the IMF's help to Kenya during difficult times in the past.  Mr Camdessus assured president Moi that the IMF would continue to give Kenya maximum help   it added. Moi pressed the U.S. To increase its level of aid to Kenya  which fell to 53 mln dlrs this year from 111 mln in 1984  and called for more U.S. Investment in the country."
"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil  well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia  the world's largest oil exporter  will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact  Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer  in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October  said:  I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.  Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.  We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified   he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.  As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December  Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement   he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait  but not sales from floating storage  Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia  in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11  said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.  Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability   he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of  swing producer  within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.  Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC   Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed  I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.  Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway  Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.  We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions   Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit."
"2","A senior Ivory Coast AgricultureMinistry official confirmed his country's backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week. The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks  convened by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)  in London on Monday. While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny  scheduled to be held in the country's capital Yamoussoukro between March 19-22  senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks  the official said. Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday. The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact  which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world's cocoa exporters and consumers. He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks  scheduled to end on March 27. The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses. Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices."
"2","Tense trade relations with the U.S.And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow. EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations. The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package  due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month  of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners. The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production  rather than a straight forward tax. They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output  but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units  over two billion dlrs  in farm costs. It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters  led by the United States. The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world  ranging from Senegal  Malaysia and Indonesia  to Brazil  Argentina  Canada  Iceland and Norway. The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments  with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain  and Denmark  the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom. Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy  France and Greece  which backed similar proposals in the past  did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected. But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action  and the foreign ministers' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument. The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports. The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill  if enacted  would provoke swift EC retaliation."
"2","Zambia's talks with the World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies  an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia  which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP)  quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December  in line with IMF recommendations  but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances  but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system  losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However  since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia  the IMF team  led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah  is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected."

"2","European sugar beet plantings areexpected to show little change from last year  despite recent firmness in world prices  analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while  so far  European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas  increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years  good autumn weather has given yields a late boost  making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called  C  sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC  A  and  B  quotas  which receive full and partial price support  respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However  with the EC budget stretched to breaking point  this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic  A  and  B  quotas  they added. In France  the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar  the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421 000 hectares  nine pct below the previous year.  The basic trend is towards stability   a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars  white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels  he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes  with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha  the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany  recent price rises have not altered plans  since planting decisions were taken a few months ago  industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385 000 hectares against 399 000 last year. British Sugar Plc  the monopoly beet processor  has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has  A  and  B  quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its  C  output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans  Wincenty Nowicki  a deputy director of Cukropol  the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises  said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan  set before prices began to rise  put plantings this year at 460 000 hectares  against 425 000 in 1986  Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market  an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270 000 ha  especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130 000 ha from a record 137 600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force  a spokesman for Centrale Suiker  the second largest Dutch sugar processor  said. The new system aims for an average of around 915 000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of  C  sugar. Last year  the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined  A  and  B  quota of only 872 000 tonnes.  The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of  C  sugar really worthwhile   the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha  against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105 000 ha from some 95 000 in 1986  the official MTI news agency said  but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180 000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern  De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S  said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365 000 tonnes from a steady area of 60 000 ha. In Sweden  where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand  the planted area is seen little changed at 51 000 ha against 51 300 last year  according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year  Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36 400 hectares  down from 37 600 in 1986."

"2","OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd ofoil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador  the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week  and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210 000 bpd. MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second  in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300 000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output  including Neutral Zone production  was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850 000 bpd  compared with its 948 000 bpd quota  and that actual liftings are much lower than that. It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55 000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices  but is still lifting 40 000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25 000 bpd of  purchase crude.  It said small equity producers  with entitlements of only 2 000 to 3 000 bpd  had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices. MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members. The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices. The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products  equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and  other forms of hydrocarbons  which are marketed in package deals with crude oil."
"2","The credibility of government efforts tostabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market  government delegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago  world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week  many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC)  which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling  is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability  but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would  distort  not support  the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the  must buy  level of 1 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact  which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 000 tonnes of cocoa  enough to mount large buying or selling operations  were carried forward from the previous agreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250 000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters  and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently  good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market. Discounts  which are currently under review  range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand  forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community  a key ICCO consumer group  with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and  a diplomatic source said  narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is  meant to support the market where trade buying is not.  In contrast  he said  producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other  more technical  issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced  posted price  as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers. In either case  delegates said  it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers."
"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil  well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia  the world's largest oil exporter  will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact  Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer  in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October  said:  I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.  Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.  We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified   he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.  As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December  Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement   he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait  but not sales from floating storage  Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia  in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11  said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.  Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability   he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of  swing producer  within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.  Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC   Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed  I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.  Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway  Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.  We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions   Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"
"2","Britain and West Germany told theirEuropean Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers  Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC  diplomats said. West Germany  also opposed to the oils and fats tax  will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers  they added. They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors  the president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis. Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports. Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who  without MCAs  would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states  which means virtually all other 11 EC states  diplomats said. Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations. The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal  describing it as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body GATT. But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC  such as Senegal  Malaysia  Indonesia  Brazil  Argentina  Iceland and Norway  they added. Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S. Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today  diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month  they added."
"2","Zambia's talks with the World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies  an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia  which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP)  quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December  in line with IMF recommendations  but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction  losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months  but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart."
"2","Representatives of cocoa consumingcountries at an International Cocoa Organization  ICCO  council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules  delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position  an observer said after a consumer meeting   They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive.  European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect  delegates said. At the January meeting  France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate  delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month's meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues  delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa  delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning  then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting  followed by a consumer meeting. Producers  who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted  reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon.  We are waiting to see what consumers say   a producer delegate said.  We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate.  The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non- members include the U.S.  a consumer  and Malaysia  an increasingly important producer."
"2","American soybean producers areconfident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance  American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said. Bennett  who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals  was speaking at a lunch. After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning  he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal  as had a number of other countries.  Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward   he said.  The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years  and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all   Bennett added. Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying  the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through  he said. The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production  and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year  Bennett said. The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC  which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax  he added. The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine  he said.  We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago  but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures   Bennett said.  The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist  and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war   he added."
"2","The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe  economists say. But many economists say the system  which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands  remains in its infancy. Its new currency  the European Currency Unit (Ecu)  has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday  the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers  ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase  originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up  decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters.  The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common   said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies  accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness  its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months  as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies  the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound  still a major world currency  outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections  due by mid-1988. Meanwhile  the system's last realignment  the 11th since it was set up  prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change.  Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level   said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence  they predict."
"2","Brazilian Finance MinisterDilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system. Speaking to a business conference he said  It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries.   The crisis is not in Brazil  a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds   he added. Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S.  Europe and Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt  he stressed the country's commitment to growth.  We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing   he said  adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis. Brazil  whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world  has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems. President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund  arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem.  We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis.  To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this year's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5 billion. Domestically  Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986  the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year."
"2","Private coffee exporters say Colombia'smore pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango  president of the exporters' association  said in an interview that Colombia  the world's second largest producer  was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas.  Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation   he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas  suspended in February 1986  and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week  including a lower export registration price  indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.  This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new   he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price  or reintegro  will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee.  Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.  Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports  he said.  We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is   he said. Colombia  with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags  exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September  and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags  compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture  a figure he said was  ridiculous.  He said ageing plantations and rust  in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia  meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks  Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas  manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London  has blamed the intransigence of some big countries  without naming them. However  Arango  like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week  was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy.  Washington will have to take into account that for many countries  and some of its allies for instance in Central America  a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.  Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said the United States will retaliate if the European Community adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils  but he did not say what EC products would be singled-out for reprisal. Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention here  Yeutter said he is  cautiously optimistic  the controversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers. Yeutter said the proposed tax is a  flagrant violation of the spirit of GATT  because it would imperil the zero binding duty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe. He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on a retaliation list. The administration would not reveal a retaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal  he said."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging Canada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports. Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments  Yeutter said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code. Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts  or to retaliate against Canadian goods  a lower-level U.S. trade official said. However  retaliation is an unlikely step  at least initially  that official said. No decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week."

ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a  pre-compromise  and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday  they said. While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented  both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement  they said.  I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day  but some time later in the session   a consumer delegate said. Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa  comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades  delegates said. Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also  and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin. Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate  with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance  delegates said. The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda  delegates said."

Representatives from 26 nations are participating in the talks here  which well-placed sources said would focus on Latin America's staggering foreign debt and efforts to pull the region out of its worst economic nosedive in more than half a century. UNCTAD's annual meeting is scheduled for July in Geneva. In april developing countries belonging to the so-called group of 77 will attempt to hammer out a common position for the UNCTAD conference at a preparatory session in Havana  Cuba."
"2","Farm subsidies and protectionistmoves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic  Michael Jopling  British minister of Agriculture  Fisheries and Food  warned.  It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between Europe and the United States   Jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech.  But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks   he said.  Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies.  And above all  Europe and the United States have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one.  He added   It is crucial that the United States and the European Community remain friends.  Jopling  who is a member of the EC agriculture committee  was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S. officials in Washington later this week. Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils. He said his government would oppose such a move because  We do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support (EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer's expense."
"2","The European Community (EC) deliveredwarnings to both Japan and the United States over trade frictions which have hit relations between the Community and its main trading partners. EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for greater effort by the country to open its markets. Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves. EC External Trade Commissioner  Willy De Clercq has already written to his U.S. counterpart  special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter  outlining the EC's concerns. The ministers' said they were  very disturbed  by the U.S. moves  adding   the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations.  Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  they said. In a separate statement on Japan  the EC ministers said they  deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.  The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand. Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop.  It wil be back on the table again and again   the diplomat said. De Clercq told journalists   There is a certain nervousness  a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan.  But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war."
"2","The European Community's (EC)executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses  after strong attacks from northern states. Britain and West Germany  backed by the Netherlands and Denmark  opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups  diplomats said. But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax  proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual farm price package  would leave a large hole in the group's budget. He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good.  I hope the debate is still open  if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget   he said. The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year  he said. Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy. The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils. Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers  mostly small farmers  who could be helped by the tax.  What we are suggesting is reasonable  it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home   he said. Britain  normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC's costly farm subsidies system  warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other countries. Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC  they said. The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism. In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President  Jacques Delors  Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers. Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission's farm price proposals  he added. Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain  despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition. The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter  by selling it at knock-down prices  turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices. National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme  which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year  but the two countries did not block today's vote."
"2","European Community (EC) foreignministers have agreed on an aid package of loans and grants totalling more than 1.6 billion European Currency Units (Ecu) for states in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region. The five-year accord increases aid to the states  Tunisia  Israel  Jordan  Lebanon  Morocco  Algeria  Egypt and Syria  by about 60 pct from the previous pact  Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans told a news conference. The EC's executive Commission had proposed a package of more than 1.7 billion Ecus  about 70 pct more than the last aid deal  but West Germany and Britain called for the rise to be kept to 30 pct. The package includes 615 mln Ecus in cash grants from the EC  while just over one billion Ecus will be made available in loans from the European Investment Bank  the EC's long-term investment arm. Details of how the money is to be distributed will be worked out by EC officials. Syria  while still officially included on the list  will not receive any money unless EC ministers specifically agree to it. The EC last year imposed sanctions against Syria because of its alleged role in the attempted bombing of an Israeli airliner."

The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its trade surplus  and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers  where it has imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties. But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war  and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research."
"2","U.S. Agriculture SecretaryRichard Lyng warned the European Community yesterday it will face serious retaliation if it enacts a new tax on products such as U.S. Soybean oil. Speaking at a news conference before a scheduled speech  Lyng said he did not think the tax  which is still in the discussion stage  would be approved. He said the U.S. Would take serious retaliatory action because if implemented  the tax would have a considerable impact on U.S. Farmers."
"2","Japan has complained to the secretariatof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules  Trade Ministry officials here said. They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers. South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991. South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45 billion dlrs in 1986  and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period. The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods  and to exporters to sell more to Japan. The officials said they believed the Japanese action  one step short of filing a suit  was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan. The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit."
"2","Inflation in the 24 industrialisednations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was 2.1 pct in the year to January  unchanged from December  the OECD said. But monthly inflation throughout the OECD was an average 0.4 pct in January  a rise compared to the 0.2 pct in the last quarter. Retail energy prices rose strongly in January  reflecting the firming of world oil prices. For OECD states the increase was 0.7 pct but the January level of retail energy prices was still 11.6 pct lower than a year earlier  the OECD said. The increase in consumer prices excluding food and energy  at 0.4 pct in January for the whole OECD area  was unchanged on the four previous months  but over the year to January OECD consumer prices rose by 3.5 pct  against 3.3 pct in December. Unadjusted annual inflation for the seven leading industrialised nations in January was running at 4.4 pct in Italy  3.9 pct in Britain and Canada  three pct in France  1.4 pct in the U.S.  Minus 0.8 pct in West Germany and minus 1.5 pct in Japan  the OECD said."

"2","The European Community cereal tradelobby Coceral has written to Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen asking for talks on ways of preventing their members losing money as a result of future realignments of currencies in the European Monetary System. In the text of a letter made available to journalists  Coceral says some members suffered considerable losses on contracts entered into just before the last realignment in January. This was because of an unforeseeable increase in monetary compensatory amounts (MCA's) for some member states  it says. Coceral estimates losses sustained by West German traders who are its members at 8.05 mln marks. It says Andriessen should work out new regulations to prevent a repetition of such losses as a result of future realignments. A Coceral spokesman said problems had arisen when traders importing cereals from weak currency countries into those with strong currencies bought the weak currencies with which they were to pay for the cereals forward."
"2","The World Bank is expected to approve a310 mln dlr economic recovery loan for the Philippines at a meeting of its executive board today in Washington  Central Bank sources said. The sources said the loan  agreed upon in principle last September during a visit to the United States by President Corazon Aquino  had been held up by Philippine government delays in fulfilling key conditions. They said the documents required by the World Bank were not submitted by Manila until late February. The sources said the loan is needed to rehabilitate the the state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)  which together are burdened with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets. They said the World Bank had insisted the two banks appoint independent auditors and draft revised charters. It also laid down several conditions for an Asset Privatisation Trust (APT) planned by the government to dispose of the banks' unproductive assets  the sources said. The APT  set up in January  is headed by banker and businessman David SyCip. The sources said the World Bank wanted respected private sector individuals to be appointed to the APT  and immunity from prosecution for the trust. It wanted a clause saying buyers of non-performing assets could not be prosecuted. The Manila Standard newspaper quoted Rolando Arrivillaga  World Bank representative in the Philippines  as saying the loan would be in three 100 mln dlr tranches. The first tranche would be available late this month or in early April. Arrivillaga said the remaining 10 mln dlrs was in the form of technical assistance available for disbursement during a 36-month period. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said approval of the loan will trigger another 300 mln dlr loan expected from the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The Central Bank sources said negotiations would start in April on another 150 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to implement reforms in the government corporate sector. The sources said the World Bank is expected to approve the loan by August  after a review of the government's non-financial institutions. The government's 14 major corporations rely heavily on budgetary support to supplement external borrowing to meet their yearly revenue shortfalls."

"2","Japan told the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade that South Korea's five-year import diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade governing body  a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATT questionnaire on unfair trade practices  the spokesman said. In the five-year plan  which starts this year  South Korea aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the U.S. And Europe. Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan  the spokesman said.  The notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint  nor is it intended to pressure South Korea. It is a routine procedure followed by all other GATT member states."
"2","The West German airline  DeutscheLufthansa AG  believes the way it decides fares is in line with European Community (EC) guidelines despite an official probe  a company spokesman said today. The Federal Cartel Office in West Berlin is investigating whether agreements reached by European airlines over fares are a breach of EC regulations on competition. Hubertus Schoen  the Cartel Office's spokesman  said the investigation had been running for some weeks. A spokesman for Lufthansa told Reuters:  Lufthansa presumes that the way we decide fares corresponds with EC regulations.  Airlines did not traditionally have to comply with a clause in the Community's treaty forbidding companies in member states from reaching accords likely to hinder free competition. However  Schoen said that last year the European Court of Justice had ruled that this clause should also apply to air traffic. The Cartel Office s probe came in the wake of this. The Office had not yet officially contacted Lufthansa  but Schoen said the airline would be asked for information about the way fares were decided. It would then be decided if the practice was a breach of article 85 of the EC treaty."
"2","Already strained relations betweenthe U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get worse before they get better  director general of the Dutch Economics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engering said. Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The Hague  Engering noted the developing history of crises over steel  citrus and pasta  and warned of more to come.  I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus ill-advised  and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation   he said.  I feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.  Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get the American balance of payments into better shape  but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure  Engering noted.  If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war  then I think the answer is probably yes   he said. In order to reduce these tensions  decision-making in the EC must become less self-centred  and the US Administration will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation  he added."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakersaid an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade. He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies. The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports  the Treasury said. The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July  1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries. It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries  the Treasury said. Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japan's willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese government's willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues."
"2","The western industrialised nations haveagreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called  mixed credits   the OECD said. The agreement  to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988  means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct  and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations. Additionally  a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits  to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries  the 24-nation OECD  which hosted the reform negotiations  said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies  and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors  notably France and Japan  using foreign aid to subsidise exports  putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments  including Austria  had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April  they added. By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use.  A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today   a senior U.S. Official here commented."

He said  the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a barrel level again  but the main thrust of investing in oil is positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher oil prices.

The Commissioners  led by President Jacques Delors  will pay a two-day visit to Bonn on April 1-2 when they were due for a meeting with the principal West German cabinet members. The meeting  the first of its kind between the Commission and the government of a member state  was originally meant to focus on problems posed by West Germany's federal constitution. But they said the meeting was now likely to be dominated by Commission plans to restructure the EC's exhausted finances and its costly farm policy  which have provoked strong opposition from Bonn. Kohl has written two letters to Delors  complaining that the plans would hit West German farmers hard.  His farm minister Ignaze Kiechle has publicly criticised the two German members of the Commission for failing to oppose them. This caused protest from Brussels where the Commission tries to guard the independence of its members from the governments that nominate them."

We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies.  American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected.

Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry  but that the attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared  more realistic.  He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S. Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds. Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against the proposed tax  he said   Realistically  from the information we're getting  it looks like the English  the Germans  hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark.  His delegation also hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue  he added. Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved  Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could be involved.

"2","The International Cocoa Organization ICCO  buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon  delegates said. The plan  presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn  represented a compromise between producer  European Community  EC  and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate  they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First  the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously  delegates said. Under an offer system  the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices  they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock  while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa  to be set by a formula  the delegates said. After the plan was presented  working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers  EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT  producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from  one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change."

The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia  Bahrain  Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar  while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed  but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting  Ahmed al-Tayer  the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry  said implementation of joint economic agreements  is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together.  The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's Finance and National Economy Minister  Ibrahim Abdul-Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC. Officials said the corporation's assets rose to 1.31 billion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985."
"2","OPEC believes world oil prices shouldbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel  OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here  Al-Wattari said:  OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.  But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries  who had been forced to curtail production  and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases.  For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel  its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production   Al-Wattari said.  Such cutbacks ... Cannot  in certain cases  be sustained   Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures  some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies  he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February  although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability  though restored to a good level  was still under pressure  Al-Wattari said.  A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation   he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC  they were insufficient in terms of volume  he added.  The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation   he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue  while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures  he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi  OPEC Deputy Secretary General  also addressing the seminar  added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides  Al-Chalabi said  adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue."

"2","Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Alial-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group. Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba  All OPEC states  without exception  are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less.  Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates  which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September  was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota  but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota  but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell. OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1."
"2","Talks are underway between financiallytroubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed at rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in sub-Saharan Africa. Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that a compromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks enabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection of cash. For its part the government is expected to increase budgetary discipline  which in turn is likely to attract foreign investors  the sources said.  Barring last-ditch obstacles  which can't be totally ruled out in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial political and economic interests  Zaire and its creditors are bound to come to terms soon   a Western diplomat told Reuters.  The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMF assistance. Similarily  the West has no interest to see Zaire's strategic minerals fall into communist hands   the diplomat said. Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it would limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to 10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987. The government also announced an end to the floating exchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed parity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic adjustments. Until last year  Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export revenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the copper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and often extravagant investment projects. Zaire  the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth largest supplier of copper  depends on the two minerals for two-thirds of its export earnings.  A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing everything for the sake of servicing its external debt   President Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he announced his government's decision. As early as January 1986  Mobutu had warned that  one does not feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt  one toward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire   he told diplomats. Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed austerity (1983-86)  it had become a net exporter of capital without receiving appropriate financing from abroad. Economists said that since the large devaluation of the zaire currency in September 1983  the country suffered a net outflow of 830 mln dlrs each year. Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few years reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross National Product (GNP)  one of the highest such ratios in the world  banking sources said. Mobutu accused the IMF of  strangling  his country at an October meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people could not long endure the hardship caused by austerity. Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the IMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which  they said  failed to materialise last year  - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and boosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity  - substantial  additional financial help from the country's traditional donors. In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at curbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency  slashed spending and privatised industry  gaining praise from Western creditors and obtaining debt rescheduling. As a result  the overall economic and financial situation improved markedly  with inflation down to 41 pct last year from 100 pct in 1983. But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living standards for Zaire's 35 mln population  fuelling widespread discontent among poorer city dwellers  diplomats said. Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between 20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months  despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced last May. The World Bank has released in the last two months half of a previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent 27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport system. Belgium  Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading partner  recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to ease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts for industry. A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the way for another debt rescheduling  probably at the next meeting of the Paris Club of Western creditor nations  diplomats said."

"2","New York cocoa traders reacted withcaution to today's developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London  saying there is still time for negotiations to break down.  I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point   said Jack Ward  president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat.  If and when a final position comes out (of the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions. The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain.  ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.  Market sentiment has reflected optimism  I would't put it any stronger than that   Ward said.  It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement... but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate   said another trader of today's developments. Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so  traders said.  The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms   one trader said. Speculators have gone net long  but only slightly so   he added. The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling  traders said."

"2","U.K. Agriculture Minister MichaelJopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway. The controversial study  which has not yet been released by the Paris-based OECD  has calculated a measure of farm subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent  PSE  OECD sources in Paris said last month. Jopling  in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday  suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT. The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do not significantly subsidize farmers  Jopling said. The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for the years 1979 through 1981. Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a negotiating tool  however  by saying the European Community would want  credit  in the negotiations for recent actions taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept. An Australian trade official said Canberra has  grave technical reservations  about the use of the PSE calculations. U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect recent changes in farm programs worldwide.

"2","Latin American sugar producersare awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production  official and trade sources said. Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S. Cents per lb in the past six months  they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost. The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert  Manuel Rico  a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA)  told Reuters. However  Rico said  it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output.  Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable   he said. Officials in Mexico  Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production  but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.  The prices are ridiculous   said Julian Mateo  vice president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League.  At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.  Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output  given the instability of world markets. An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.  The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.  In 1985  the latest year for which full figures are available  Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes  raw value  of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A year earlier  they had produced and exported about 800 000 more  according to the London-based International Sugar Organization. Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover. Miguel Guerrero  director of the Dominican Republic's National Sugar Institute  said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply. Output had slumped to under 450 000 tonnes a year from 900 000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries  poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output  he added. Plans of nearby Cuba  the world's largest cane sugar exporter  to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious  trade sources said. Output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970. Cuba suffers from run down plantations  harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices  since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals. Last year  bad weather added to its troubles  and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985. The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U.S. And  in the case of some Caribbean countries  European Community (EC) import quotas  for which they receive prices well above free market levels. Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market. Peru  for example  shipped 96 000 tonnes to the U.S. In both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76 000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37 000. A national cooperative official said that  as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru's production cost  the future of the industry is uncertain. At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which  according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre   grows like a weed  throughout the region. Brazil  the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes  uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency. The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year. Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year  coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop  has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987  trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far  the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace. Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year  with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles. However  the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps. Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.  The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets  by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries   Brazil's Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting. The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices. GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact.  They have to realise that the more our economies suffer  the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt   GEPLACEA's Latorre said."
"2","The European Community (EC) haswarned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners. The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman  head of the EC delegation in Washington  to Dan Rostenkowski  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters. Denman told Rostenkowski  an Illinois Democrat  he backed aspects of the bill  such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry. But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices. Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved. He said  If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory  then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.  Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws  saying  in the last resort  any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.  Otherwise  he said   the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States  i.e.  retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.  Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims. Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.  Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system   he said. House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing  similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan. There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment."
"2","World food production over the next decadewill exceed population growth  but because of unequal distribution  many parts of the world will go hungry  the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. In a report to be considered by its agriculture committee at a meeting later this month  FAO said:  The long term trends point towards a further polarisation of the world food system.  Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubled by chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of the poorer countries and regions will still be faced by the combined problem of low nutritional levels  rapidly rising populations  inadequate growth in both food production and incomes...   FAO said. FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by the committee  which meets between March 23 and April 1. These included improving the international trading environment for agricutural commodities  reducing food surpluses in developed countries  conserving natural resources and speeding up the increase of food production in developing countries."
"2","Representatives of the InternationalWrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME. In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system  industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis. Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry  the release said. By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex. The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction  industry delegates said. The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal  made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week. A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change  the press release said."

"2","Dismantling agricultural subsidiesand implementing international farm policy reform will be the top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice Economic Summit  Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of American farm leaders.  We want to see the American farmer put in a position in which he can compete on a level playing field   Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers. The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the most serious farm crisis in modern history  Shultz said  and how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world agriculture. Government policies that subsidize production and exports have created a  crisis of overproduction   he said. Shultz particularly criticized European Community policies which he said encourage domestic production by providing high government supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with the help of huge subsidies. The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue current high levels of subsidies  he said. But the U.S. cannot stop subsidies alone  Shultz said.  We have to agree to dismantle these systems together   he said. The U.S.  EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead in agricultural reform  he said. For that reason  U.S. officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva."

"2","The European Community (EC) farmers'and farm cooperatives lobbies  Copa and Cogeca  have backed the EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation mechanism  claiming it would not harm consumers. In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans  current president of the EC Council of Ministers  they said the mechanism  often referred to as a tax  would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances. This would have been the case in May 1984  when soya oil prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne  they noted. If such price stabilisation is not implemented  EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences  the letter  made available to journalists  said. Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC produced oils and marine fats. The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced  and possibly to become a subsidy  as world soya oil prices rose from present levels."

"2","Higher world oil prices  coupled with anew realism ushered in by austerity  could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits  bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct  the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd)  well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia  still the world's largest oil exporter  is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year  when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel  probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs  compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.  Austerity is still the watchword  but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects   a diplomat said. In the short-term  the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves  still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to  tough it out  on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year.  It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy   he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced  markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks  hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector  have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector  one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad."
"2","The rebate granted at yesterday's ECsugar tender represents some concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc  EC Commission officials said. The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention. The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed  the officials said. The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854 000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates. They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores. Payment for it is due five weeks later  and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar  the officials said. The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar  it is determined to immediately resell it  a move which would drive down market prices further. They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.  We think they realise they have gone too far   one official said."
"2","American soybean producers and processorsare hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed  but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced. Wayne Bennett  the American Soybean Association's first vice president  told a news conference the U.S. Administration would not hesitate to retaliate  but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed  Bennett said. The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support. Bennett said West Germany  Britain  the Netherlands  Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax  but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue.  Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically  but that is not correct because we would hit back   NSPA chairman Jack Reed said. This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced  he said. Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962  he said. Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty-free."
"2","The results of a controversial studyof farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world  and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. Results of the study  which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries  were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified. The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent  PSE. The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE  or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage  averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81  with the European Community at 68.8 pct and the United States 48.2 pct. For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct  the EC 28.1 and the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC 13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct  the OECD calculations show. In coarse grains  Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC and 9.5 pct for the U.S.  OECD concluded. For sugar  Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.  the study shows. The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada  Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U.S.  EC and Japan  the sources said. Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil  two major developing country producers of commodities  were not included in the OECD work. Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon  perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May. Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva. British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture. He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels  which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture. However  the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers  officials familiar with the study said. The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84. In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD's  in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81  U.S. officials said. For example  the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84  at 25 to 49 pct  than in the EC  at zero to nine pct. French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale  citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn  told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC. However  the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984. Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels  a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation. The updated calculations  which may take several months to complete  are expected to show substantial increases in U.S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry. U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill  which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice  officials added."
"2","Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoabuffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization  ICCO  council meeting which opened here today  delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving.  The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week   Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations  optimistic and realistic.  The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January  with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen  with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch  and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs  when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week  delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn  and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock  an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa  and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock  delegates said. During the morning council session  the Ivory Coast delegation gave  an open minded statement  that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible  Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon  chairman of the ICCO council  was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks  Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place. Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today  but could arrive this afternoon  delegates said."
"2","The European Community (EC) Commissionsaid it approved a 680 mln stg British government aid package to state-owned Rover Group Plc &lt;BLLL.L> to restructure and privatise the group's bus and truck subsidiaries. In a statement  the commission said Rover's &lt;Leyland Trucks> subsidiary would be financially and physically restructured following a recently announced merger between Leyland Trucks and &lt;DAF> of the Netherlands. The Commission said government aid for this program was justified because it would contribute to Europe-wide rationalisation of the truck sector. The amount of aid approved is slightly below the 750 mln stg the British government had planned to grant Rover by writing off accumulated losses and other costs. The Commission said there was overcapacity in the European truck industry estimated at between 25 and 40 pct. It said its approval of the aid also took into account the consequences for jobs and for the regions affected by the restructuring. Under EC rules  the Commission has to approve all government aid to industry."

"2","European Community (EC) industryministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country bloc into reasonable balance with demand. The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22 000 jobs. Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme  most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion  but did not go nearly far enough. Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes  provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products  typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body  the Commission and representatives of member states. However  diplomats said it was clear from today's discussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system  which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products  while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel industry  the largest in the EC  should not suffer proportionately more than others  German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister  Giles Shaw  insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account. The state owned British Steel Corporation  benefitting from massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts  is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black. Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry."

"2","Mining companies may have todevelop specialty metals and metal-containing products if plastics and other substitutes are not to make further inroads in their markets  according to the United Nations. In a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on world mineral resources  U.N. experts termed conditions in the non-fuel mineral industry  unlike anything that has been experienced for the last half century.  Effects of slower global economic growth were compounded by diminishing use of the major and base metals and the development of substitutes in traditional markets  it said. The report was prepared for a nine-day session next month of the U.N. committee on natural resources  an organ of the Economic and Social Council. The gap between world productive capacity and demand would eventually be eliminated by closing mines  the report predicted.  Although for the most part mining companies have been slow to develop specialty metals and metal-containing products and to develop markets for such products  it seems that such activities will be needed if plastics and other metal substitutes are not to make further inroads into the traditional markets for the major and base metals   the experts said.  Integration of metal-producing and manufacturing enterprises between and among developed economies seems to be a likely consequence.  The report noted that  because of low prices  there was little incentive for new investment in mining except in the case of gold  which continued to attract investment at current prices with important increases in production in the past two years in North America  Australia  Papua New Guinea and Latin America."
"2","A new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow  chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.  The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation   he told a news conference. The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference  held under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative prices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian/Singapore currency  he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the  may sell  and  may buy  points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price  as well as the  must sell  and  must buy  zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord.  The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply   he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550 000 tonnes  Xuto added. At this month's session  which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA  the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention ( may sell ) price (currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower intervention price ( may buy ) price (171 cents at present) for six months  the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact  the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly  when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300 000 tonnes  there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks  which began on March 9  producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the  lower indicative price  (or floor price) of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock  currently 360 000 tonnes  reached 450 000 tonnes. The proposal  initiated by the U.S.  was withdrawn last Friday  setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA  Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct."
"2","Sugar which EC producers plan to sellinto intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community  broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price  with detrimental consequences for producers' returns  Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course  such as removing the time limit on storage contracts  which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September  Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export  the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders  Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price  the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne  it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy  Czarnikow says  but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price  Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany  79 250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention  but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price  West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the  green  mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved  the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand  it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded  Czarnikow says  suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of  unnecessary bureaucracy  surrounding the export tender system."
"2","The International Cocoa Council  ICCO adjourned for the day after a detailed proposal on buffer stock rules was distributed and executive committee officials were elected  delegates said. Producers  EC consumers and all consumers are scheduled to hold separate meetings tomorrow to review the proposal  written by ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn  they said.

"2","European Community (EC) industryministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures  drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer  and calculated to lead to the loss of about 22 000 jobs. The ministers resolved that the proposed closures  which should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand   remain considerably below the surplus in capacity.  They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with Eurofer  major steel companies and with governments  to pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the annual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer. The Commission will draw up a new system  of steel production quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full rigors of open competition. Commission sources said any new system would cover only heavy products representing about 45 pct of the market  instead of 65 pct under the present system. Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet again in Brussels on June 1  the sources said. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990."
"2","The European Community Commission hasdecided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize  Commission sources said. They said the tax  which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike  would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia. The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's cereals management committee today. The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries. The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them. The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450 000 tonnes of maize. The request will be considered at the committee's next meeting  the commission sources said. Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year  while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years."
"2","Several leading farm-stateCongressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income. Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing  chairman Dan Glickman  D-Kan.  proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks.  Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation   Glickman told the hearing. The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection  or marketing loan. David Haggard  American Soybean Association  ASA  president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program. The current soybean program  gave us the worst of both worlds   ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America  he said. At the same time  the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers  Haggard said.  We need some kind of market loan   he added. The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority. Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA  but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a  dilemna  which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what  if any changes  are under consideration. In his testimony  Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers  such as a so-called producer option payment  or a direct payment program. Haggard said barring any program changes  Commodity Credit Corporation  CCC  soybean stocks  now at 385 mln bu  will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.  Thus  CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987   Haggard said. However  Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT. He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating. The Reagan administration has given  mixed signals  on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC  Haggard said. While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan  Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby  D-La.  which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan. The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee  Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois. Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans  but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs. Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget. Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan  the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered."
"2","This weekend's meeting of LatinAmerican coffee producers here will call for the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) to start talks aimed at firming prices  Nicaraguan foreign trade minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said. He said those countries which had confirmed their presence were Brazil  Mexico  Guatemala  El Salvador  Costa Rica and Panama. Colombia had been invited but he did not know if it would attend. Martinez Cuenca told reporters central america alone had lost some 700 mln dlrs through the weakness of world coffee prices  partially caused by lack of an ICO quota agreement."
"2","The OPEC Fund for InternationalDevelopment approved 100 000 dlrs in aid for Ecuador  which was struck recently by an earthquake. The Fund  which was set up by the 13 OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) member states to help Third World development  said in a statement the money would be used to provide medical supplies for the earthquake victims. Ecuador  itself a member of OPEC  suffered a major blow to its economy when the earthquake damaged a pipeline carrying crude oil  its chief export earner."
"2","Sir Roy Denman  Head of the ECDelegation in Washington  said pending U.S. trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.  To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake   he told the Foreign Trade Association here. Denman told reporters that possible retaliation  which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski  would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis.  Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product   Denman said. He said in the case of textiles import restrictions  however  retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.  Certainly  if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S.  the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe   Denman said. He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.  This would conflict with international obligations  throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang   he warned of the tariff proposals. Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors.  Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party   he said  adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another."
"2","One of the top executives of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) has tendered his resignation charging that the United States has been pressuring the agency to reduce the conditions it places on some loans  monetary sources said. C. David Finch  an Australian who heads the IMF's exchange and trade relations department  told the IMF executive board on Wednesday that he planned to leave by the end of next month after 37 years with the agency. The sources said that Finch  in a statement considered unprecedented  told the board that the United States had brought undue pressure on the IMF to approve funding for Zaire and Egypt.  To resign in this manner is highly unusual  perhaps unprecedented   a monetary source said. Neither Finch nor U.S. IMF Representative Charles Dallara could be reached for comment. The IMF  since the emergence of the debt crisis in 1982  has pressed many countries to tighten their belts and cut back on social spending as conditions to granting assistance. The United States recently has been taking the position that countries that take needed economic reform measures relying more on market forces and private enterprise should be encouraged by assistance from the IMF and development banks. Zaire  under the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko has recently been taking many reform measures designed to heal its ailing economy. The IMF last year approved a 22-month loan package for Zaire totaling 270 mln dlrs. The United States has been considering the possibility of seeking access to a military base in Zaire but no decision has been reached. Egypt  for its part  has been holding talks with the IMF aimed at reaching a final accord on a new one billion dlr loan package with the United States pressing for a quick deal  according to the sources. However  they said a tentative plan for Egypt that is currently being reviewed by the management of the Fund prior to going to the executive board for full approval has raised a number of questions about the country's ability to repay. Egypt is also a linchpin in the broad framework of U.S. Middle East policy. The department headed by Finch  among other responsibilties  makes certain that IMF policies and loan conditions are wielded evenly among countries. Monetary sources have said that the United States had brought pressure on the IMF to approve a loan package for Mexico using economic conditions that have not been broadly used before  but Finch  according to the sources  made no reference to this. Under the debt initiative announced 18 months ago by Treasury Secretary James Baker  the United States made the decision that debtor countries should be encourged to grow out of their difficulties rather than rely on austerity measures. He also recommended that commercial banks provide 20 billion dlrs in new loans for the debtor countries while the mutilateral banks add some six billion dlrs over three years. A key part of the proposal gave the World Bank a much greater role in dealing with the debt crisis  in part because of its familiarity with developing countries and their problems. The initiative  while widely heralded as a good first step toward improving the the growing debt crisis  was viewed by some at the IMF as a rebuke of previous austerity measures insisted upon by the Fund in return for loans."
"2","Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take overas executive director of the International Sugar Organization (ISO) in mid-April  ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff said. Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-February last year. Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the  house in order  by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved allocations of voting rights and financial contributions. Once this is done  time can be dedicated to working towards a new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economic clauses  he said. Ricart  currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador to Austria  the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva  said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia  Brazil  Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact."
"2","The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)will be renegotiated  International Sugar Organization (ISO) officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pact's council. A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses  but a different voting and budgetary structure  or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses  he said. But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world's four major exporters -- Australia  Brazil  Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget. At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50 000 stg later this year. Currently  about three quarters of this year's ISO 800 000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact. The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade. The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the next full council session in the week of May 19. There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO."
"2","Whether the European Community'sCouncil of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain  an EC official said.  It is very far from certain that it will go through   Sir Roy Denman  Head of the EC Delegation in Washington  told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association. Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved  as it would limit U.S. soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon. Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks  it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track.  The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic   he said."
"2","Two World Bank review teams are in thePhilippines to assess government requests for funding for an expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program  bank officials said. They told Reuters the housing program loan request is for 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs. The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr long-term loan from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its land reform program. The officials said negotiations will start next month on another 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reforms in 14 major state-owned corporations. On Tuesday  the world bank approved two loans totalling 310 mln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program. The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loans to finance geothermal and education projects  sources said. World Bank sources said the bank's lending to the Philippines since 1957  including the latest loan  totalled 4.3 billion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100 loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed. The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs in loan commitments to the Philippines during the last three years of President Ferdinand Marcos's rule. Marcos was toppled by a military-civilian revolt in February 1986.  The loans were cancelled because the projects slated for aid were not implemented properly   they said. The sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be used to rehabilitate the state-owned Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which are saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.  At least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans were supposed to go to the DBP   the World Bank sources said.  Over the past three years the bank's disbursement pipeline to the Philippines almost completely dried up.  In 1986 alone  the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos in loan repayments  about 59 pct of the government's budget deficit of 27 billion pesos for the year  they said. Agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle last September when President Corazon Aquino visited the U.S. The sources said the loan was held up because of delays by the government in submitting essential documents. The World Bank sources said the request for land reform funding would be discussed at a meeting of the World Bank-led consultative group to be held alongside the April 27-29 annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Osaka. The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants. The sources said the Philippine government estimated the entire program would cost 60 billion pesos.  About 27 billion is long-term and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly by landowners   they said.  The landowners will be paid in 10-year bonds redeemable in ten instalments.  The sources said the bulk of financing would cover development costs for the land program and help to bridge the gap between the 10-year spread of payments to landowners and a proposed 30-year loan repayment period for land buyers.  If you include interest  the total amount of external assistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs   the sources said.  That volume of aid does not appear difficult.  They said Japan  the World Bank and the ADB are expected to provide most of the financing while the Philippines' 12 bilateral aid donors would contribute the rest. The World Bank sources said lending to the Philippines is designed to support its balance of payments position while the government aims for a target of six to seven pct annual gross national product growth.  Brazil did not do this homework   one said.  They pushed ahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing for their balance of payments position. Manila is being more cautious and aims at soft borrowings which  it is hoped  will be outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result in the country emerging from debt in five or six years.  Philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs."
"2","Steel output in the majornon-Communist producing countries fell sharply in February  continuing a long-running trend  International Iron and Steel Institute figures showed. Production in the 30 countries which report their figures to it was 6.9 pct below the February 1986 level at 32.03 mln tonnes. Output in the United States fell 18.5 pct to 5.30 mln tonnes  that in Japan 7.8 pct to 7.27 mln and that in the European Community 6.5 pct to 9.91 mln. The figures continue to indicate a switch away from these traditional major producing countries to the more advanced developing countries. Brazilian February output rose 9.2 pct from year-earlier levels to 1.73 mln tonnes and that in South Korea was up 7.5 pct at 1.17 mln tonnes. The 30 countries covered by the figures account for about 97 pct of world non-Communist steel production  the Institute said."
"2","The death of the world's tropical rainforests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters  scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations  including Brazil  Mexico and the Philippines  to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals  they said. The experts  gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week  said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers.  For many third world nations  the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources   said Delfin Ganapin  a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact.  In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest  now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt  the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious   he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result  the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas  said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood  or the millions of species within.  No replanting programme has been successful   said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks  the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber  a five billion dlr a year industry  is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests  and nations must be educated in how best to  farm  them  said Peter Kramer  World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan  and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year  he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research  develop and produce man-made substitutes  at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000  only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber  from 33 currently  and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion  a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank  Inter-American  African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84  only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects  it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2 000 mln hectares remaining  up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers."
"2","The French farmers' union  FNSEA  hopesFrance will resist European Community (EC) pressures over farm prices and notably those of the European Commission at coming ministerial negotiations in Brussels  FNSEA Secretary-General Luc Guyau said. He told a press conference the union was concerned about the future of the EC Common Agricultural Policy. France must define its position well before negotiating and not just adopt a short term policy  he said. The FNSEA  with around 700 000 members  holds its annual congress next week  when over 500 delegates will debate the theme of  facing up to the future.  The period of change we are going through obliges us to face up to new challenges   Guyau said  referring specifically to the demographic changes in French agriculture.  Forty-five per cent of our farmers are over 55 years old this year   he said."

All bids for wheat were rejected. However  the total to date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the 3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80 000 tonnes of French maize granted for export moved the total to 135 000 tonnes since the tender opened in February this year. There were no facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export series."
"2","A solution to Brazil's debt problemsis unthinkable without the involvement of the International Monetary Fund  Juergen Sarrazin  management board member of Dresdner Bank AG responsible for Latin America said. Sarrazin told the business daily Handelsblatt that Brazil's interest payments moratorium had cost it the goodwill of many banks.  Now there will certainly be no solutions without the IMF   he said.  Alternatives which could be imagined before  such as bringing the IMF in with us in a loose form  are over   he said. Sarrazin  who through Dresdner represents German banks in several rescheduling coordinating committees  noted that Brazil was still prepared to negotiate. But he said work in the coordinating committees had already run into difficulties before Brazil's interest moratorium. Justified calls by debtors for more flexibility from the banks were blocked because U.S. Regulations made solutions such as capitalising of interest virtually impossible  he said. Although many European banks were opposed to the use of interest capitalisation   this was an alternative which has to be brought in   Sarrazin said."
"2","Brazil's hard-line debt stance  thoughmeeting creditor resistance  is boosting political initiatives in Latin America aimed at broadening the global strategy  regional debt officials and economic analysts say.  Now more than ever it is clear that Latin America cannot pay  under present conditions  without sacrificing growth   Peruvian President Alan Garcia said  referring to Brazil. And  as debtors and creditors prepare for their annual meeting at the Inter-American Development Bank in Miami next week  the region's debt crisis is clearly coming to a head. Around 200 billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have been rescheduled since 1983  with interest rate margins now below one pct  multi-year accords a norm and no financial crash in sight  but a lasting solution seems no nearer. Virtually all Latin American leaders backed Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of private bank debt last month  though prospects of a chain default are still remote. Mexico  Colombia  Argentina and others rejected such action and Mexican finance minister Gustavo Petricioli merely said   Brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary.  But Brazil's action has had an impact on other debt negotiations  speeding agreement for Chile and Venezuela last month and influencing current talks with Argentina. Pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts  with the Philippines joining Brazil in seeking interest relief and Ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments following a serious earthquake. Private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lending and accept innovative repayment schemes  not only by debtors but also by official agencies which have stepped up their own credit flows as part of the U.S.-inspired plan. One Latin American debt official said he saw the Brazil and Ecuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors to link debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such as export earnings  GDP or raw materials prices. Despite this  debtor countries continue to accept the case-by-case approach  and Cuba's call for a joint negotiating front is not being promoted by Brazil or even defended by Peru  the region's flag-bearer in unilateral payment decisions.  Each nation must negotiate its debt independently  according to its own needs   Brazilian foreign minister Ramiro de Abreu Sodre said in Caracas at the weekend. Venezuela's rapid agreement with its creditors  soon after Brazil's move  had been seen by the political opposition as a betrayal of debtor solidarity  but de Abreu praised the Venezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal. Argentina  Bolivia  Costa Rica and others are also pursuing normal negotiations with creditor banks  while at the same time pressing hard for better terms  particularly lower interest rate spreads. Latin American officials say that while the debt should be negotiated case-by-case  their governments are promoting a general framework for talks based on growth and development priorities  lower interest payments and new financing.  The Brazilian and Ecuadorean experience shows orthodox solutions to debt cases don't work   said a senior Peruvian government official responsible for debt affairs. He saw a growing likelihood that other countries would follow Peru's action in setting a 10 pct debt payment limit in the face of trade and other factors beyond debtors' control such as minimal bank lending. These factors have contributed to a 130 billion dlr net outflow from Latin America in the last five years  and Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro says Brazil alone paid back 45 billion dlrs in this time and received just 11 billion in loans. Latin American debtors feel they have complied with their side of the bargain  slashing public spending  devaluing currencies  cutting inflation  privatizing state enterprises and introducing debt equity schemes. Brazil  as the region's biggest debtor and its most diversified economy  has now apparently adopted the principle that a tough position with its creditors will avoid a more serious crisis later on.  We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis   Funaro told a conference in Rio de Janeiro this week. billion dlr debt burden this year are slim  with coffee prices plunging  oil prices up but still well below 1985 levels and interest rates beginning to rise. Mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two to three pct projected earlier  and inflation near 80 pct after 105 pct last year. Brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct after eight pct last year and a 30 pct drop in the projected trade surplus  while independent estimates put inflation at 200 pct. Political and economic analysts in Brazil believe the payment suspension will give new impetus to tackling the regional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations  a view echoed by senior international bank officials. Some banks  including Citibank  Morgan Guaranty and Bank of America are already preparing to downgrade their Brazil loans. Brazil's refusal to accept an IMF program  a condition set by many banks for new lending  meanwhile reflects the view of most Latin American governments that equate the Fund with recession. But Brazil and Venezuela are the only countries in the region to have rescheduled debt without an IMF program."

The spokesman  speaking from Bonn  said   We have good reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the proposed tax.  Several top government officials told the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association delegations there was no reason for American producers and processors to pay for EC agriculture  the spokesman said. European agriculture was facing severe problems  but both the Community and the U.S. Should work closely within the framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  he said. The delegations will continue their top level meetings in Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to the U.S. At the weekend. The EC and the U.S. Realised the tax issue would stay on the agenda for several months and there were indications that both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations  the spokesman said."
"2","Japan's economic policies face fierceinternational attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus  international monetary sources said. At a meeting this week in Paris  senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus  they said. Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen's sharp rise against the dollar  they still tend to surge when growth picks up  according to the OECD. As a solution  the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy  boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy  they said. That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board. The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members. The United States  which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan's fiscal stance  joined in the attack  he said. The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters  including the IMF  believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct  monetary sources said. The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise. The yen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market. Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus  which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs. Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen  Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians  including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  are clearly hoping the yen will weaken  government officials said. At a meeting in Paris last month  Britain  Canada  France  Japan  the United States and West Germany  agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels. Officials said that wording represented a compromise. Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months  before it weakens later in the year. Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar  perhaps by substituting the word  recent  for  current   while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar's weaker levels now  perhaps by use of the word  present   they said. In the months leading up the February 22 agreement  the dollar dropped some 10 yen. The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency. Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts  which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen. Officials said there are already signs of that. More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad  they said."
"2","Japanese Agriculture Ministry officialssaid a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  is still under way and will be completed sometime next month. The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far  and they said Japan would comment on the final results. A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries. Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study  the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May. One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then  partly because of tight budgetary policy  and foreign currency factors have also changed  he said.  The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country  such as geography   the source said. He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.  This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further  but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy   he said  without giving further details. A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community  but Japan is a major importer  he said."
"2","The European Community (EC) andSoviet-led Comecon ended talks here  having made progress on setting up formal trade relations  but no breakthrough because of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC  delegates said. Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen  head of the EC delegation  told Reuters as he emerged from the final session:  We made some progress  but we have called for another meeting.  Officials  who asked not to be named  said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC. Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said:  We wanted the territorial clause in  but Comecon said no.  A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions  but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work. Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon. Zdzislaw Kuroski  deputy director of Comecon  who heads the East bloc delegation  told Reuters ahead of today's session:  We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions  but not on all questions.  Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community  he replied:  This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented.  West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement. The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January. The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year  the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states  about half the deficit of the previous year  due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC."
"2","The European Community Commission hascharged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT. In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington  the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods. The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question  which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters  conformed to its rules. Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if  after a GATT decision against it  Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules. The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo &lt;AKZO.AS>  whose  aramid  synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm &lt;Dupont> that the fibres violate the American company's patents. Akzo alleged that the ban  imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)  was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions. The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.  Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States   it said in a statement."
"2","The U.S. Will pursue its complaint thatEuropean governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft committee  a GATT spokesman said today. The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today. GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce. The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S. Complaint  starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in July  trade officials said.  The tension has eased   the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters.  The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.  U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus  voiced during a visit to European capitals in February. In a letter calling for the special committee meeting  Washington charged France  West Germany  the U.K.  Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus. The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view. Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices. Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings."
"2","A new International Natural RubberAgreement  INRA  was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today. The new accord is due to replace the current one  which expires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented  a historic moment.  The latest round of talks  which began March 9  represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years. Xuto described the negotiations as  by no means easy  and we often faced problems.  The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now  delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended  but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies  Xuto added. He also praised  the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session.  Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia  speaking on behalf of producers  said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is  a vital consideration for multinational tire companies  whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply.  He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact  to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France  speaking for consumers  agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed  he said  consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning. He added that the adoption of the new agreement  attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry."
"2","Japan has agreed to drop barriers toAmerican-caught herring and pollock  opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced. Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo. He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years. There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments  but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms. At the same time  Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish. He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement."
"2","The Soviet Union's winter graincrop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter  an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said. Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell  author of the EF Hutton publication  Global Crop News   said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain  possibly wheat  from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.  Compared with last year  the outlook (for the Soviet winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic   she said.  But it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot will depend on spring weather  not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop  but also for spring planting.  Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation  she said. The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops  she said. However  she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover  which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage. The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year  primarily from Canada  the European Community  Argentina and Australia  Martell said. She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand. Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures  while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy. Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes  and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports. However  she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union  noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the 1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn. Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand. In 1984/85  the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86  the Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only 24 pct of that total. While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87 was 22 mln tonnes  many U.S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes  she said."
"2","Deputy Finance Ministers from the Groupof 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to discuss the world debt crisis  trade imbalances and currency stability today following last month's Paris monetary accord  sources close to the talks said. The officials met at the offices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary policy in preparation for the IMF's interim committee meeting in Washington in April. The talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the U.S.  West Germany  France  Britain  Japan and Canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985. Other countries represented at today's talks were Italy  which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions  the Netherlands  Belgium and Switzerland. Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their economies to more foreign imports."
"2","The European Community (EC) agreed onnew rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region's forests. Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide  widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes. The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles  with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990. The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles met the new standards. There are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use in the EC  according to Commission figures. The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol  after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars  diplomats said."

The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol  after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars  diplomats said. West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21. But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol. Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps  diplomats said. They added that  of the 97 mln cars in the EC  only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol. Under EC law  ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol."
"2","Representatives from 26 Latin Americancountries ended a United Nations trade meeting here today with a call for greater economic integration between developing and industrialised countries.  (We) urge the international community to recognise the ... difficulties which confront the region   a statement released by the group  termed the San Jose Communique  said. The meeting was held under the auspices of the Latin American Economic System  CEPAL  a United Nations affiliate  and aimed to develop a joint regional position ahead of July's conference in Geneva of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  UNCTAD. The communique said Latin America's priority remained the need for sustained economic growth and for easier terms on its 400 billion dlrs external debt. Within that framework the region would be pressing in Geneva for more access to industrialised markets for its exports and for compensatory capital inflows when world prices for its mainly agricultural exports were low  it said. The communique also said the group would press for the generalised system of preferences -- easy entry terms for developing country exports -- to be expanded. UNCTAD was set up in 1964 to promote better international trading conditions for developing countries and help raise their standard of living."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conablesaid he believed Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt interest payments is temporary. Conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown on public broadcasting tomorrow said Brazil now has the attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan designed to reform its economy.  I think the Brazilians have the attention of many of their creditors  but they must come up with a plan that will persuade people that the Brazilian economy is going to be put on a course that will result in some growth.  Turning to Japan  Conable said the role of that country has been increasing in the World Bank and is expected to continue to do so. He said that Japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr pledge to the International Development Association  an indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in line with its economic position. Conable said there was no indication that the Soviet Union was serious about joining the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He said they would have to get convertible currency and open their books and the Soviets  don't usually do that."
"2","Bolivia  once Latin America's mostdelinquent debtor  is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan  a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed  Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF  its first since 1980  opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil  which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club  which have yet to be finalised  had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue  he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies  including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank  although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs  up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23 000 pct a year  state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages  set a market- related rate for the peso  introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months  according to the Central Bank  and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks  some 900 mln dlrs  on which interest has not been paid since March  1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal  but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal  mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps  similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps  but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run  especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable  Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin  which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984  has collapsed on the world markets  and gas  the country's major revenue earner  is in abundant supply in the region."
"2","The new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA)  like the 1979 pact  will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price  currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo  will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22  when the 1979 INRA expires  the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention ( may sell ) price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention ( may buy ) price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly  if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300 000 tonnes have been made since the last revision  the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the  may buy  and  may sell  levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price  and the  must buy  and  must sell  levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents  unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations  consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock  currently 360 000 tonnes  rose to 450 000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400 000 tonnes  with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150 000 tonnes. Under the new accord  the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session  Ahmed Farouk  speaking for producers  said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France  who spoke for consumers  agreed that the current agreement had worked  relatively well.  Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA  delegates noted that for nearly its whole life  the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the  must buy  level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition  provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated  ruling out speculation.  It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement   one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational  it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements  the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conable isexpected to press Indonesia  the Third World's sixth largest debtor  to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues  western diplomats said. Conable  who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo  will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well  but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java  Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia  the only Asian member of OPEC  has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices  which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia  a country of 168 mln people  has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending  devaluing its currency by 31 pct  and trying to boost exports  while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change  particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy.  Oil prices  the debt crisis  the world recession  all call for major policy adjustments and external support   Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month  he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.  We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed   Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs  according to the Bank  which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia  but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support  the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures  and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports  liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month  the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies  which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1  from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87."
"2","Indonesia has protested to the EuropeanCommunity (EC) about its plan to raise import duties on vegetable oils  which will affect the country's palm oil exports to the EC  Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said.  Indonesia  both individually and together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports   he told Indonesian reporters.  We very much regret the community's plan   he added. He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made. Indonesia is a major palm oil producer. According to central bank figures  Indonesia exported 362 700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301 400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986. Complete 1986 figures are not yet available. Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said recently that the increase in EC duties would add a new burden to ASEAN countries at a time when they were trying to strengthen their economies in the face of lower commodity prices."
"2","French Foreign Minister Jean-BernardRaimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the European Community (EC). Negotiations have been under way between the Community and the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for three years. Raimond  due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE)  told the semi-official daily Al-Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be reached.  I am confident that problems between the two big partners  the GCC and the EC  will find a solution. I will work to reach that solution   he said in the interview conducted in Paris. An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between the two sides. GCC members Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Bahrain  Qatar  the UAE and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached. Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a long time because there were 20 countries involved. But added:  Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for making crucial progress.  Referring to the Iran-Iraq war  he said efforts should continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties. He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others remained unresolved. He gave no details but said:  France wishes to have normal relations with Iran."
"2","Long term pressure by tradeministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) is to succeed  New Zealand's Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said. Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22 nations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers  need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the political problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be faced and resolved.  Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of such international gatherings  which includes the OECD ministerial meeting in May and the G-7 meeting in Venice in June  enabling ministers to maintain contact. World trade conditions are getting better not worse  he said. He said New Zealand is  moving rapidly and of our own initiative in the direction of liberalisation  and I warn you we shall be looking for partners."
"2","The United States and Japanare on the brink of serious conflict on trade  especially over semiconductors  Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers  and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC  the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years.  Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is  maybe  five or six years in the future.  He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago.  That's a very healthy development   he added. If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.   Members of Congress  that is the contemplative members of Congress  have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit   Yeutter said.  They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and  in my judgement  more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.  He added   Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter."
"2","Brazilian business leaders attendinga weekend meeting with President Jose Sarney called on the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in resolving its debt problems. The government has so far rejected suggestions that it let the IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt  the biggest in the Third World. Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program for Brazil  adopted four years ago  caused a recession and he believes another IMF program would stifle growth. Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr commercial debt  a move which has found little favour among the country's business community. Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF  arguing this would give the country access to new funds and allow the economy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the course they favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.  We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does  if necessary going to the IMF   Mario Amato  president of the Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation  was quoted as saying. An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very difficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm indications such a policy reversal is in the offing. The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance is Finance Minister Dilson Funaro  who was not present at yesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his absence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present seized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see Funaro leave his job."
"2","Taiwan is holding discussions with theAsian Development Bank (ADB) to try to settle a political dispute over its representation in the bank  a foreign ministry spokesman said. Taiwan  one of the founders of the 47-member ADB  boycotted the annual meeting last year to protest against a decision to change its membership name to  Taipei  China  after the admission of Peking. The foreign ministry spokesman said a decision on whether Taiwan would attend the next meeting in Japan on April 27-29 would depend on the results of the talks.  We are looking for a fair and just solution to the question of representation   he said. In Manila  an ADB spokesman declined to comment on the statement.  We have no comment at all   he said."
"2","Debt among African countrieswill continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates  Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said. He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries. Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo.  I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries   Mamman said.  The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries.  Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990. Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.  With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists   Mamman said. Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness  he said.  The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports   he added."
"2","Japan has assured a meetingof trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy. Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that  in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September  a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved. Hata  speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting  said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy  but did not elaborate. Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever  reflecting financial deficits  payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries. Despite great potential  developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties  particularly debt  he added. The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este  Uruguay  and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.  It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled   Hata said. Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others. In order to rebuild the free trade system  it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end. As part of its contribution  Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market more open to developing countries  he said."
"2","Australian Trade MinisterJohn Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis. In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries. He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem.  We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform   Dawkins said. The Venice summit is scheduled for June. He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round  the eighth under the GATT  are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system. Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este  Uruguay  have made a reasonable start  but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes.  We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice.  The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years  he said."
"2","Philippines Trade andIndustry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils. Concepcion  speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here  said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted. He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries. Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers  he noted that  I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.  He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices  but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.  The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed   he said."
"2","A settlement could soon be reached in thedispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies  Jean-Marc Vernes  president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say  which is leading the protest  told journalists today.  Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution   he said  adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854 000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention. Vernes said that the protest  involving 770 000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone  was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention. At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed  compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level. Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take  but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market  providing they were not losing money by doing so. Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1  when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores  or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date. The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers."
"2","The United States and Japanare on the brink of serious conflict on trade  especially over semiconductors  Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers  and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC  the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years.  Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is  maybe  five or six years in the future.  He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago.  That's a very healthy development   he added. If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.   Members of Congress  that is the contemplative members of Congress  have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit   Yeutter said.  They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and  in my judgement  more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.  He added   Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter."
"2","Brazilian business leaders attendinga weekend meeting with President Jose Sarney called on the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in resolving its debt problems. The government has so far rejected suggestions that it let the IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt  the biggest in the Third World. Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program for Brazil  adopted four years ago  caused a recession and he believes another IMF program would stifle growth. Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr commercial debt  a move which has found little favour among the country's business community. Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF  arguing this would give the country access to new funds and allow the economy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the course they favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.  We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does  if necessary going to the IMF   Mario Amato  president of the Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation  was quoted as saying.

"2","Ministers from more than 20nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured. Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.  We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system   he said.  We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all   Moore said.  The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000   he added. The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the  Uruguay round  talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful  with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected. Moore said one aim was to  instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.  Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits  as well as preventing  bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.  The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks  patents and copyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states. Earlier  New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons. Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French delegation."
"2","Producers and consumers representingmost of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) aimed at stabilizing world prices over the next five years. Negotiations for a new INRA  to succeed the present one which runs out next October  began nearly two years ago. Agreement on the new five-year pact  which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall  was reached at a two-week session here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)."
"2","The world's dependency on the Mideastas the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it  Donald K. McIvor  an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.  Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable   McIvor said. Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence  McIvor said. McIvor  Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.  Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year   McIvor said.  The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity   he added. McIvor said that of the some 30 000 oil fields discovered so far only 37  one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.  McIvor said  in response to a question  that he did not believe there were any more  super giants   or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels  to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.  Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope).  McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east  particulartly in Canada  the North Sea  and Australia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.  The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies   McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy. Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but  the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.  McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.  Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply   McIvor said.  Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat  as an industrial fuel   he added."

"2","A number of individual zinc producingcompanies have approached the European Commission to sound out its reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntary reduction of smelting capacity  Commission sources said. The companies have been told that the Commission could not judge whether a plan would be acceptable under European Community  EC  competition rules until it had full details  they said. In 1983  the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss of about 130 000 tonnes of annual capacity  or about 10 pct of the total. However  the industry did not proceed with this plan as zinc market conditions improved in 1984  the sources noted. They said the companies which approached the Commission recently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisage a loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983."
"2","The European Community (EC) cerealstrade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention  which it claims could save the EC budget money. It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere  he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium. Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution."
"2","Portugal's Agriculture Minister AlvaroBarreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC)  a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Following legal proceedings by private importers  Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part  as it had done  in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports. As a result of this ruling  EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80 000 tonnes of maize. Barreto said   My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part.  He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders. Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator  whether public or private  from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC  given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market  had an unfair advantage over them.  There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system   Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible. The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly."
"2","A further special session of theInternational Tin Council  ITC  held here tomorrow  March 24  will give member countries an update on the latest debate over the hundreds of millions of sterling lost when its buffer stock price support scheme failed in October 1985  delegates said. But the ITC quarterly session scheduled for April 8-9 will be important  as the council will by then be wanting to decide on whether the current pact should be extended beyond June 30 or just allowed to expire  delegates said. A two year extension is possible."
"2","Amalgamated Metal Trading  AMT  todaylodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council  ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22  when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict  Michael Arnold  head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations  told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council  that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act  and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association  and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition  Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award  and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt  an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months  but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case  it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal  Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these  brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd  is to be heard on May 11. Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin  ring-out  in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to June 8."
"2","Senegal  Ivory Coast and Ghana are thebiggest recipients among developing nations of a special European Community (EC) aid program to compensate for lost export earnings  EC figures published today showed. The EC has special trading and aid agreements with 66 countries in Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific. This includes a program called STABEX under which it provides aid to export-dependent countries if export earnings drop too much. Senegal received about 155 mln European Currency Units (176 mln dlrs) between 1975 and 1984 mainly to compensate for a fall in its peanut export earnings. The Ivory Coast received 108 mln ECUs (123 mln dlrs) and Ghana received 91 mln ECUs (104 mln dlrs) mostly to make up for a drop in coffee and cocoa export earnings. Under the EC's STABEX aid program (export earnings stabilisation system)  the Community provides special financial assistance to developing countries if export earnings in certain raw materials fall below an established level. The EC provided about 1.06 billion ECUs (1.21 billion dlrs) in STABEX aid from 1975 to 1984  including 273 mln ECUs (311 mln dlrs) for losses in peanut exports  261 mln ECUs (298 mln dlrs) for coffee and 150 mln ECUs (171 mln dlrs) for cocoa."
"2","The EC Commission will decide shortlyprecisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States  Commission sources said. Under the accord  reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership  the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990. All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries. The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year  as it was rather late to make other arrangements. They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports. There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries  although such a tax could be imposed later  the sources added."
"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este  Uruguay  last September. Yeutter said  at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.  There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and  a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there   Yeutter said. However  the hard work is still to come  with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead  he said.  It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy   he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating  he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process  but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years  he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that  which is an ineffective use of financial resources  he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations  he said  one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package."

"2","A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter  in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks  told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.  That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round   he said.  The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.  The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed  he said.  Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round   he said. But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.  It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two   he said.  They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future   he said."
"2","World Bank president Barber Conablepledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices  but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia  hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half  is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank  which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments  was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.  We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy   he said. He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis  and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports  encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However  key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country."
"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April.  We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date   he said.  I am not sure we can wait until late April   he added. Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries. Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors  Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka. The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country.  I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast   Yeutter said."

"2","Canadian Trade Minister PatCarney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time. She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly  support for agriculture should avoid production incentives  and thirdly  countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices  Carney said. Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively. Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos  Switzerland  in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates  and not only the European Community  voiced reservations about some of the principles. Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.  The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion   she said. However  the meeting did not identify what those areas are  Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations  which must be concluded at least in draft form by October  are progressing well."
"2","Philippine Secretary ofTrade and Industry Jose Concepcion  who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences  said he was pleased with the latest gathering here. Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.  Also  the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries   he added in an interview with Reuters.  In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries   he said. Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a  shining act of faith  in the world trade system. Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive. He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers  quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples. He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand  which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines  to encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador."

"2","A ban by a Portuguese court on thestate buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders will remain unless it is reversed in Portugal or challenged in the European Court of Justice  European Commission sources said. They denied a statement yesterday by Portuguese Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto that the commission had accepted that EPAC should be eligible  saying it had taken no view in the matter. Under the terms of Portugal's accession to the European Community  a grain import monopoly held by EPAC is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part  as it had done in the past  in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports."
"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este  Uruguay  last September. Yeutter said  at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.  There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and  a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there   Yeutter said. However  the hard work is still to come  with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead  he said.  It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy   he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating  he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process  but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years  he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that  which is an ineffective use of financial resources  he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations  he said  one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package."

"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April.  We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date   he said.  I am not sure we can wait until late April   he added. Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries. Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors  Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka. The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country.  I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast   Yeutter said."
"2","World Bank president Barber Conablepledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices  but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia  hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half  is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years."
"2","A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter  in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks  told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.  That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round   he said.  The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.  The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed  he said.  Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.  But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.  It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two   he said.  They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future   he said."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conablelinked increased borrowing by Indonesia  the Third World's sixth largest debtor  to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers.  We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy   Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.  The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them   he stated. Indonesia  the only Asian member of Opec  has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken  including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah  and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.  The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world   he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel  plastics and cement  western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures  but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects  which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month."
"2","Indonesia's foreign debts are a causefor concern  but remain within manageable limits  World Bank President Barber Conable said. He told a press conference before leaving for Tokyo that Indonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and cause for concern. But he said it was not necessarily due to imprudent borrowing and  it is still within an area of being manageable.  The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts of around 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to a projected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88  from 25 pct in 1986/87 ending March 31. Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers. Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the rise in the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio by reducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments. Indonesian debt servicing of 6 760 billion rupiah takes up almost one third of the 1987/88 budget. Payment on the principal of government debts is officially projected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billion in 1986/87. Conable linked an increase in World Bank lending to Indonesia to implementation of further economic policy reforms."
"2","Emergency action to distributeEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme  a Commission spokesman said. Almost 60 000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20  when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme  and March 13  according to latest commission figures. The food  including 30 000 tonnes of cereals  6 000 tonnes of sugar  4 000 tonnes of beef and 13 300 tonnes of butter  has been distributed to the needy through charities. The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31. But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system. The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers. However  commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates. On the other hand  the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter  520 000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals."
"2","The president of the Export-ImportBank said the Bank was changing its lending policies to reflect changing conditions in export financing. President John Bohn told a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing commercial banks have largely withdrawn from financing exports and export projects were becoming smaller.  Exporters now need financing in riskier markets and on deals which are smaller  take longer to put together and close   Bohn said in his testimony.  Lenders  however  want less risk  higher profit  transaction-oriented and less labor-intensive activities.  It became clear to us the EXimbank must assume a broader range of explicitly defined country and transaction risks than it has previously. Programs and procedures need to be simplified  streamlined and internally consistent   he said. Bohn said the Bank would focus on the needs of the middle market product or service exporter and would have essentially one loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-term and long-term export transactions.  Both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing  the maximum permitted under the OECD consensus. Eximbank loans will carry the minimum interest rate allowed by the OECD rate schedule for the market and the term   he said. Bohn said the Bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billion dlrs for regular loan obligations  of which up to 200 mln dlrs may be available as tied aid credits  and a limitation of 10 billion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments. He said the Bank would have to come back to Congress later this year to discuss its capitalization needs."
"2","European Community (EC) member stateshave generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the European Commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season  EC diplomats said. They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes  taken together  would have too harsh an impact on farmers' incomes. Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission's overall package  they said. As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals  the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices. EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday."
"2","An extension of the sixth InternationalTin Agreement  ITA  for one or two years beyond June 30 is increasingly likely  International Tin Council  ITC  delegates said following a special council session today. A formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council session on April 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget and activities for the year beginning July one  they stated. Delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal ITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact. The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd  AMT  against the January court ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC creditor brokers to have the ITC wound up. In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the tin council  the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the U.K. Companies act  and the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in respect of an arbitration award. AMT is appealing on all points and has said it is important for the court to accept that a winding-up petition is a move to enforce an arbitration ruling."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules  with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.  Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday   a consumer delegate said.  The atmosphere is excellent.  Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1  if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a  very interesting stage of negotiations   delegates said. The package  based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates  has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers  the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal  the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired  delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis  rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before  giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin  similar to golf handicaps  to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins  they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager  the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock  they said. The purchases would be limited to 5 000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20 000 tonnes per week  and could be bought in nearby  intermediate and forward positions  they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is  transparency   meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible  delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985  when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds  cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism  they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow  as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline  when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn  delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed. Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules  producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices  delegates said."
"2","There is a good chance that the UnitedStates and Latin America will agree reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talks yesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.  This is a complex issue  but I am very optimistic on an agreement  he told reporters during the IADB's annual meeting here. The U.S.  which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank  has proposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct  a move strongly opposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct. Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when the issue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank interim meetings next month in Washington. He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America's position during talks yesterday with the so-called  A  countries - Brazil  Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffer a net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes a substantial capital increase. Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment of funds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90  plus 2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment. But Washington has previously said it would not agree to a nine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reforms were agreed  a position described today by Nicaragua's Central Bank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic. Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed  flexibility in being prepared to accommodate different proposals  and promised to look into alternatives. He said an alternative now being looked at was for new procedures for delaying IADB loan approval  to satisfy U.S. concern that lending is currently too lax  rather than a change in the basic voting structure. There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby it would need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for a year  after which a second review would require a 40 pct blocking vote.  Any change in the basic voting structure would require a change in the IADB's charter  and in turn a lengthy process of prior approval by the Congresses of each country   Petricioli said. In common with Venezuela  he expressed reservations on the conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington's proposals for increased IADB sectoral lending  but welcomed a bigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy."

"2","The European Community (EC) has failedto agree on a high-technology research program because of opposition from Britain and West Germany  diplomats said. But Belgian Research Minister Guy Verhofstadt told reporters the two had been given just over a week to end their opposition or risk plunging EC research into a crisis. The so-called  Framework Program  proposed by the EC's Executive Commission was designed to boost research in areas such as computers  biotechnology and telecommunications and combat U.S. And Japanese domination in these fields. The five-year program was due to start at the beginning of this year  but was delayed by calls from Britain  France and West Germany for cuts in the proposed budget of 7.7 billion European Currency Units (Ecus)  diplomats said. The EC Commission had already cut the budget from 10.5 billion Ecus  but under EC law the program needs the approval of all member states before it can be launched. France has withdrawn its objections and backed a new compromise budget proposed by Verhofstadt to trim spending. But Britain is continuing its demands for further  sharp cuts in the budget. West Germany  which yesterday appeared to be ready to accept the compromise  was also holding back. Verhofstadt  who chaired the lengthy meeting  said he had given the two states until April 3 to withdraw their opposition. But if one or both failed to do so  the EC would be left without a research program  leaving no money for schemes such as the EC's Esprit information technology drive.  If that happened ... There would be a grave crisis in Europe's scientific and research policy   Verhofstadt said  adding it could mean research teams being disbanded. Diplomats said West Germany was close to agreeing to the compromise  which would limit new spending to 5.4 billion Ecus by allowing for cash already set aside for future projects. The plan would also set aside at least 16 pct of the 5.4 billion Ecus for spending after the end of the five-year program  they said. But Britain still maintained the allocations were much too high. Britain's Research Minister Geoffrey Pattie faced a tough fight to convince his government colleagues they should accept an increase in spending beyond the 4.2 billion Ecu level so far demanded by Britain  one diplomat added."
"2","The Ferruzzi Group's holding companyAgricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies  a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said. When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York  it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5 000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year  or about one third of EC production  from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake  and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas  of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share  and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future  notably in the production of ethanol for fuel. Raul Gardini  president of the Ferruzzi Group  said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts."

"2","Governments of major Asianproducing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA)  but growers and traders are unhappy with the development  according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia  Indonesia and Thailand  which produce the bulk of the world's rubber  said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA  to replace the current one which expires on October 22  was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360 000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400 000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150 000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members  he said. Under the existing pact  members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse  like the International Tin Agreement.  This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance   Lim said. Malaysia  the world's largest producer  was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members  he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened  they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations. Malaysian growers  however  said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers.  With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level  consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price  while producers may never see sharp price rises   a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360 000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises  he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock  and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock  they added. Traders in the region  meanwhile  said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future.  The 360 000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned   a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it  but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations."
"2","Considerable uncertainty surrounds theoutcome of today's EC white sugar tender  traders here said  noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to move over 800 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said that due to the dispute between the Commission and producers over the issue  it is not clear whether the Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences on a large tonnage. The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos  although traders are reluctant to predict a precise level after prices fell yesterday. Earlier  traders in Paris said they expected the Commission to award licences for around 50 000 tonnes of white sugar with a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus. Last week  the Commission granted licences to end August on 60 500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819."

"2","A total 59 000 tonnes of current serieswhite sugar received export rebates of a maximum 45.678 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender  the U.K. Intervention Board said. Out of this  traders in West Germany received 34 750 tonnes  in the U.K. 13 000  in Denmark 7 250 and in France 4 000 tonnes  it added. Earlier today  London traders had expected the subsidy for the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug to be more than 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos but Paris traders were more precise by forecasting a rebate level of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus. London traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the on-going dispute between the Commission and European producers over the threatened action by the producers to move over 800 000 tonnes to intervention. Last week saw 60 500 tonnes whites athuorised for export at a maximum rebate of 44.819 Ecus per 100 kilos."

"2","Inflation in the European Community which fell to its lowest since the 1960s between November and January  started to take off again last month  figures from the EC statistics office Eurostat showed. Consumer prices were on average three pct higher than in February 1986  the office said. This compared with a year on year rise of 2.7 pct in January  the lowest for 25 years  and was the highest figure since October. Prices rose in February by 0.3 pct from January  after rises of 0.4 pct in January and of 0.2 pct in each of the last three months of 1986."
"2","International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase of negotiations  delegates said  but they remained confident about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday. Cocoa producers  European Community (EC) consumers and all consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday. The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time  they said. Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock  and the fixed price differentials at which different origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager. Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be included in the buffer stock because  if it is  countries such as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining it  the delegates said."
"2","International Cocoa Organization  ICCO Council chairman  Denis Bra Kanon  said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement. Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa  consumer delegates told reporters. Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems. Producers and consumers indicated support  in principle  for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group  consumer delegates said. Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends  but certain technical points need further clarification  the delegates said. Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities  consumer delegates said. Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas  such as Ghana origin  which are normally required by manufacturers  they said. Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa  which would depress prices  they added."
"2","Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC)president Jorio Dauster said he will not attend the ICO executive board meeting and was surprised to hear that a report of his absence had a slightly depressing effect on the New York coffee market today.  I have too much work to accomplish here in Brazil at the moment. Besides the presence of the IBC president at an ICO executive board meeting is not a tradition   Dauster said. Dauster said except in rare cases  Brazil has always sent its London-based representative to ICO board meetings. Ambassador Lindenberg Sette will attend the meeting  he said."

The bank said the loan is being made through its affiliate  the International Development Association  and will be used to restore economic confidence  approve the allocation of resources  and stimulate economic growth. The bank said the the 50-year credit  which is interest free  comes as there is growing evidence that reforms already underway have improved the country's economic situation."
"2","President Jose Sarney rejected callsfrom foreign creditors and from some Brazilian businessmen that the government talk to the International Monetary Fund. In a speech to about 3 000 mayors and local officials  Sarney reiterated that the government would not accept any monitoring of its economy by the IMF. He said   We are going to struggle with courage for Brazil and its growth. For this reason I have said that Brazil will accept no monitoring by the IMF.  In highly-publicized talks with Sarney near Sao Paulo last Saturday  several Brazilian business leaders said they favoured a return to the IMF  arguing that it would make debt negotiations easier and bring new money into the country."
"2","Guyana hopes to overcome its financialproblems within three to five years and is now seeking help from donor governments  Finance Minister Carl Greenidge said. He said Guyana took its problems in January to the Caribbean Group for Cooperation and Development  which includes governments and multilateral agencies  with a view to finding a long-term recovery plan. Guyana's arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loans in the near future  Greenidge told Reuters during the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) annual meeting here. MORE Greenidge also said a World Bank mission would visit Georgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan that would enable Guyana to revive its economy. But he said the government does not expect to be able to reduce its arrears this year. Arrears to the IMF and the World Bank are projected to rise to 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. About 90 mln dlrs of this  equivalent to nearly half Guyana's annual exports  would be owed to the IMF.  Expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man to give a pint of blood   Greenidge said. But Greenidge said Guyana has taken steps to reduce its fiscal deficit  which now amounts to 65 pct of GDP. It has increased taxes  reduced public expenditure and refinanced its internal debt. He said the World Bank would meanwhile look at investment requirements for potential export-earning projects such as gold mining  timber  oil and kaolin. Because of its arrears  Guyana has been unable to draw down a 40 mln dlr World Bank loan for a bauxite industry rehabilitation project. Bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs of exports  or 40 pct of the total."

"2","The European Community (EC) considerstalks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round  Willy de Clercq  external relations commissioner of the EC  said. He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early  seperate agreement on agricultural trade. He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este  Uruguay  last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT. Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services. De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand. Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative  Clayton Yeutter  also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible. But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations  and the EC did not want changes.  We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached  and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks  no fast track  no slow track. It has just one track  the track - and that's all   de Clercq said.  If you start selecting priorities  your priority is not my priority. We say that agriculture is urgent  but it's not the only urgent thing   he said. He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months to prepare and eight days of negotiations."
"2","The rebates granted at yesterday's ECsugar tender represent a further concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc  trade sources said. They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention. The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2.5 Ecus below this level. But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers. The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores. The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it. EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy the sugar  it is determined immediately to resell it  a move which could drive down market prices further."
"2","The International Wheat Council (IWC)lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1 377 mln  compared with 1 351 mln tonnes the previous season. In its monthly market report  the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln. The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere. The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect. At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off. Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook  the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise. After damage to its maize crop last year  the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987  the IWC said. Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87  the IWC said. It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at end&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes  respectively  against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier. After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season  the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC  Canada  the U.S. And North Africa."
"2","The European Community Commission saidit had approved the creation of Himont  a company in which Montedison SpA &lt;MONI.MI> of Italy and Hercules Inc &lt;HPC.N) are major shareholders  after requesting changes in the two partners' plans for the venture. Twenty pct of the capital of Himont  in which Montedison and Hercules originally planned to take 50 pct stakes  has been floated publicly and marketing and production agreements have been modified on the Commission's advice  it said. Himont  which is incorporated in the U.S.  Groups the two firms' assets in the polypropylene sector. The modified agreements include the abandoning by Hercules and Montedison of all their direct activities within the EC in the downstream market of Himont. The EC authority said the modifications meant that the creation of Himont did not appear to lead to restrictive coordination of activities between Hercules and Montedison  nor did their respective market shares give them a dominant position. The Commission must approve such link-ups between competitors under EC competition rules."
"2","The European Community today sold181 500 tonnes of ageing butter to the Soviet Union at a special knockdown price  a spokesman for the EC Commission said. He said the EC's Dairy Management Committee accepted bids from operators to export the butter  mainly from intervention stores in Belgium  West Germany and the Netherlands  at a price of 21.1 European currency units per 100 kilos. The butter was bought into Community stores at 313.2 Ecus per 100 kilos. The sales are part of the EC's process of attempting to run down its butter surplus."
"2","World Bank president Barber Conable saidhe was concerned about the state of Brazil's economy and urged the country to come up with a plan soon to put its economic house in order.  I am very concerned about the Brazilian economy   he told reporters after a news conference in Tokyo. He said Brazil had caught the attention of the world with its decision last month to stop paying interest on its loans from commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time it gained by failing to come up with a new economic program. Brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community as the country is 108 billion dlrs in debt  including some 68 billion owed to commercial banks. Brazilian Finance Ministry sources said in Brasilia yesterday that the country was preparing a new economic strategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth. Despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure  Brazil has said repeatedly that it will not go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help in drawing up a new plan for fear that will only throw its economy into recession. Conable said the country may be able to get away with not going to the IMF for help  but will need an IMF-type economic program if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders. Outsiders like the World Bank are reluctant to suggest possible solutions to Brazil's economic problems because of the delicate political situation there  he added. While the World Bank has a role to play in helping Brazil  it can&#127;ot replace the IMF as an overseer of the economy  Conable said. He added that the Fund can be very flexible in its dealings with developing countries  adjusting its approach to the political realities. Brazil still seems willing to talk to the Fund under the annual discussions that all IMF members undertake  Conable said  adding that this could partially solve the current stalemate. During his news conference  Conable said the World Bank backed U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's Third World debt initiative  which calls for stepped up lending to heavily indebted Third World countries adopting economic policies.  The World Bank believes the Baker initiative is the best approach   he said.  Debt forgiveness is difficult to design in any fair way and also will tend to discourage further investment and development.  He cited the recent multi-billion dollar debt package for Mexico  the Third World's most indebted country after Brazil.  Will it work?  he asked.  We don't know...But we think it more likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested.  Conable  who is here to meet government and business leaders  expressed confidence that Japan will make increasing use of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.  We are quite confident Japan will make an increasing investment in development because of their willingness to support institutions like ours in increasing ways with each passing year   he said."
"2","Efforts by governments to control wheatsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success  the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report. Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas  as employed in the United States  the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina  Australia  Canada  the EC and the U.S. In some countries  for example Australia and Argentina  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income  there may be problems in reducing production. A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment  with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries. They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively  support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold  without needing to be stored for a long period. This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production  the report said. The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production. The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency. For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms  the currency in which most export transactions are denominated  the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure  the report says. The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India. The period saw an upward trend in yields  although this was countered in the Argentina  the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages. In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises  particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives."

"2","The Senate voted to condemn theproposed European common market tax on vegetable and marine fats and oils and said it would result in retaliation. The non-binding Senate resolution  a sense of Senate sentiment  was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.  The administration should communicate to the European Community the message that the United States will view the establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and immediate countermeasures   the resolution stated. The resolution said the European Community Commission has proposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish oils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices for the 1987/1988 EC marketing year. The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct of the current price of soyoil and  have a restrictive effect  on U.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC. It would be  blatantly inconsistent  with obligations of the EC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT  the resolution said  and  constitute another egregious attempt  to impose EC agricultural costs on trading partners."
"2","International Cocoa Organization  ICCO council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning  delegates said. Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences  mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations  including Britain and Belgium  favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa  delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper  lower quality non-member cocoas  particularly Malaysian  will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market. Producers  meanwhile  say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member  and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join  delegates said. As to differentials  Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal  so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock  producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas  such as Ghanaian and Brazilian  they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out  including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby  intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries  delegates said."
"2","Treasury Assistant Secretary DavidMulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities.  I do not believe they have up to this time   Mulford told a Senate banking subcommittee. He said that for the U.S. trade deficit to continue improving in the next two years   We need more policy actions  across the entire front of U.S. trade relations  including Canada and the newly-industrialized countries (NICS). In particular  he said  efforts by South Korea and Taiwan to strengthen their currencies were still disappointing. Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis. He noted that Japanese and European imports from Latin nations were significantly smaller than imports into the U.S. He stressed both Germany and Japan must continue to take economic and structural measures to ensure stronger sustained economic growth."

They said a special committee of agricultural experts from EC member states had voiced strong objections over the measure during a meeting charged with preparing the ground for the annual EC farm price-fixing which begins next Monday. They added that only France and Italy had indicated they would support the Commission proposal which would lead to a tax initially of 330 Ecus per tonne during the 1987/88 price round."
"2","World seaborne iron ore imports willfall sharply by the year 2000 with declining imports to the EC and Japan only partially offset by increased demand from South East Asia  a report by Ocean Shipping Consultants said. The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports of 267.7 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 312.4 mln tonnes in 1985. It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct  or 200 billion tonne miles  with shipping demand associated with the coking trade down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles. The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in 2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89 mln from 124.6 mln tonnes. Imports to South East Asia are seen rising to 58.6 mln from 32.6 mln tonnes in 1985. It predicts that EC steel production will fall to 109 mln tonnes in 2000 from 135.7 mln in 1985 with Japanese production falling to 92 mln from 105.3 mln. South Korea and Taiwan are expected to double their output to 40 mln tonnes with Chinese production increasing by 25 mln tonnes to 80 mln  it added."

"2","British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch  analysts said.  I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S.  and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher   said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own.  It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack   said Prescott  Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.  Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market  particularly those that are acquisition targets   Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp  an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years  with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago  and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8  and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4  while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share  but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices.  They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years  and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view   Margoshes said.  They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded   Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves.  I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market   Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard  most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S.  but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S.  The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock   said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986  Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs  compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs."
"2","Jorge Cardenas  manager of Colombia'scoffee growers' federation  said he did not believe any important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO). The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March 31 and could decide to call a special council session by the end of April to discuss export quotas.  It's going to be a routine meeting  an update of what has been happening in the market  but it's unlikely any major decisions are taken   Cardenas told journalists. Earlier this month  talks in London to re-introduce export quotas  suspended in February 1986  ended in failure. Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria  also talking to reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee meeting  said the positions of Brazil and of the United States were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas. Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil would not change its coffee policies. Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile levels of producers. He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October  the start of the coffee year  and February."
"2","International Cocoa Organization's ICCO  council chairman Denis Bra Kanon continued work towards a compromise plan on how the ICCO buffer stock should buy cocoa  consumer delegates said. Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formally presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers  and it was unlikely he would do so before Friday  they said. There was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding items could be reached by Friday  when the council session is due to end  consumers said. Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with several delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft buffer stock rules package  they said. Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount of non-member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy  differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby  and forward material  the delegates said. The buffer stock working group finalized the remaining buffer stock rules  with only minor modifications to the original draft buffer stock package produced last week  the delegates said. The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive director when it reconvenes Friday  producer delegates said. Producers intend to present a single candidate for the post  and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from Ivory Coast  they said. Earlier  the existing executive director  Kobena Erbynn from Ghana  was expected to re-nominated  but he is now likely to withdraw  the delegates said. The executive committee is due to meet Friday at 1100 GMT  with the council unlikely to reconvene until late Friday  consumers said."
"2","French Agricultural MinisterFrancois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community  EC  cereals  sugar and oilseeds sectors  which he said would disrupt these markets. The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers  he told farmers here.  I give you my word that France  while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion  will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms   Guillaume told the annual conference of the country's major farm union  FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88. Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months. There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output. But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA's farmers. His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts  MCA's  however  are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers. Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm sector.  The Minister's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks   he told reporters  adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a ministerial level. Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring. Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister. There have been certain advances on cutting production costs  reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid  but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers' indebtedness  he said. Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire. The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid  Lacombe said."
"2","Energy and Mines Minister ArturoHernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to achieve price recovery and stabilize the market. Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the market  the danger of a reversal is always present.  March and the next two or three months will be a really critical period   Hernandez said. He said   We will be able to define a movement  either towards market stability and price recovery or  depending on the market  a reversal.  Earlier this week  Hernandez said Venezuela's oil price has averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average price  he said  Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs. Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean oil exporters  formed in 1983. Ministers from member states Ecuador  Mexico  Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day conference  while Colombia is present for the first time as an observer. Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of ideas about the oil market. However  the members will also discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil currently before the U.S. Congress. Following the opening session  the group of ministers met with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores  the presidential palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by Hernandez of Venezuela  Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of Ecuador  Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago  Jose Luis Alcudiai  assistant energy secretary of Mexico and Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia."
"2","The United States' emphasis on itsforeign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit  the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year  the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system  it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem  the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit  could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt  it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings  lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers  would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would  however  increase inflation and reduce world trade   it said.  The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain   the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar  risk of higher U.S. Inflation  concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan  West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies  it added.  Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year   the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar.  Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates  which  in turn  would adversely affect world trade.  But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States  despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S.  Both human and in underutilised factories  were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986  about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct  continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade  GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly  while their imports increased moderately  although full statistics are not available yet  GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower  and only five of them (Chile  Colombia  Philippines  South Korea  and Thailand) had higher exports."
"2","India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat  tobacco  tea  coffee  jute  engineering and electronic goods  as well as minerals including iron ore  are all on offer in return for crude oil  petroleum products  chemicals  steel and machinery  trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade  which began in 1984  comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).  The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports   a commerce ministry spokeswoman said  adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However  countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December  the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March  against almost nothing in 1984/85  official figures show. However  the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees  the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union  involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil  is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87  against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade  which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit  is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia  Venezuela and Brazil  the trade sources said. The trade deficit  which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86  is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors  including the slow growth of foreign reserves  a tight debt repayment schedule  shrinking aid and trade protectionism  businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past  when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.  MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India   a trade official said  adding that the policy remains flexible.  We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India   the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft  ships  drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return  the trade sources said. Illustrating the point  the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return  the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract  against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi  the trade official said.  We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest   he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods  including jute bags and cars. But despite India's new drive  countertrade has some inherent problems  they added.  It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced   one trade source said.  The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants.  Another added   Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty.  This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."
"2","Four major Japanese steelmakers plan toform a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than the U.S. And the European Community for a year from April to keep prices above output costs  company officials involved said. The companies are Nippon steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T>  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd &lt;SMIT.T>  Nippon Kokan KK &lt;NKKT.T> and Kawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T>  which together account for some 95 pct of Japan's total seamless pipe exports. The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected later this month  the officials said. Under the plan  the four companies will set floor prices for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar  reduced world demand caused by lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in price-cutting competition  the officials said. In calendar 1986  seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mln tonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981. The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices  saying it depends partly on volume  but industry sources estimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct to some 800 dlrs a tonne."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conablecalled on Japan to boost investment in developing nations  for its own sake as well as that of the world economy.  Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World   he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics.  I would be pleased with additional support.  With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets  Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads  bridges and other infrastructure  he said. Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage. It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America  China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world  he said. Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate  the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate  the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  Conable noted. Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans  designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade.  Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future  though maybe not this year   Conable told Reuters after his speech. Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct."
"2","A scheme to distribute surplus foodfree to the poor in the European Community (EC)  which was due to expire next Tuesday  will be partially extended for a further month  an EC Commission spokesman said. He added the executive Commission has not yet decided whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm produce. Almost 60 000 tonnes of cereals  sugar  beef  butter and other food have been authorised for distribution under an operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in which charities act as executive Commission agents. The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's unusually cold European winter. The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme fully in Greece  which has recently been hit by unseasonal snowstorms  for the month of April. Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of flour  semolina  sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate next month. He said the Commission  which has powers to continue most aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further  will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent. Cost  which has already reached around 65 mln European currency units  would be a major consideration. End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter  520 000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals."
"2","A final compromise proposal on cocoabuffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization  ICCO  council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members  delegates said.  We are close  nearer than ever to accepting it  but we still have some work to do   producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting. European Community  EC  delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted  no problems  in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today  the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting  they said. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases  delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure  up five percentage points from earlier proposals  represents a concession to consumers  delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area  delegates said  was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock  by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as  just fiddling.  But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them  delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby  intermediate or forward positions  delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council  most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week  or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise  and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied  they said. Consumers are due to meet before the council."
"2","Consumer members of the InternationalCocoa Organization  ICCO  accepted a final buffer stock rules compromise   on the condition that producers also agree   consumer spokesman Peter Baron said. The full council was meeting at 1530 GMT to discuss the compromise  which was put together yesterday by ICCO chairman Denis Bra Kanon. Consumer delegates said they were optimistic the council could reach agreement on the rules fairly quickly."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock  the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices  ICCO delegates said. The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week  after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the  may-buy  level of 1 655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact  the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market  they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager  Juergen Plambeck  to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system  not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials  ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non-members  such as Malaysia  will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby  intermediate and forward positions. The council meeting  which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself  was continuing  the delegates said. The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations."
"2","The cocoa buffer stock rules justdecided by the International Cocoa Organization  ICCO  council will take effect immediately  delegates said. That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin buying cocoa within two or three weeks  after organizing communication systems and assessing the market  they said."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure  consumer delegates said. The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials  under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to Malaysian. Thus  if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a Malaysian price of 1 200 stg a tonne  he would accept Ghana offers up to 1 337 stg. Differentials were fixed as follows  Country       Differential stg/tonne Malaysia           0 Brazil            55 Ivory Coast       67 Cameroun          77 Nigeria          120 Togo             130 Ghana            137 Nigeria's differential is on  landed weight  terms. Shipping weight terms will be accepted at a 15 stg discount to this rate."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) council adjourned after agreeing buffer stock rules for the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement  an ICCO spokesman said. The buffer stock will begin operations immediately  he said. He confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system  and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins. Purchases from non-members will be limited to 15 pct of the total and buying or selling operations in any one day will be restricted to a maximum of 40 pct each for nearby  intermediate and forward positions  he said."

"2","A senior Nicaraguan official said arecent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries. Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March  to 1 279 stg from 1 580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America  both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas  used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement  were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement  Martinez said. He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements  and because consumers tried to dictate to producers."

"2","Japan is becoming dangerously isolatedagain as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth  officials and businessmen from around the world said. As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen  making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise. The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April  last year. The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses  Japan must  make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.  Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short  or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture. On Friday  European currency dealers said European central banks  annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises  might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito  head of top Japanese business group Keidanren  spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community.  Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance  the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report   he said.  We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time   Saito said. Saito's words were ignored. In February  EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said  I only know that your government  under the leadership of Maekawa  points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking  more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.  And Europeans and Americans want quick action.  A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy  the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future   visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained  which was partly the fault of Nakasone  who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs  said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued  U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem.  We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action   said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.  The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour   said Philip Caldwell  Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can  said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report  including restructuring of the coal and steel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this  underlined by von Moltke's reference to the  leadership  of the Maekawa report. Even so  Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures.  Without endorsing the report as policy  officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report   the ambassador said."

They said De Mel will propose to IMF officials that Sri Lanka trim its budget deficit and control its balance of payments by cutting back on development projects and other government spending. He hopes to get approval for a structural adjustment facility and compensatory financing facility starting in June. De Mel will also attend a Washington meeting of the Group of 24 from April 5 to 8."
"2","Philippine coconut oil exports to Europewould be virtually wiped out if the European Community (EC) implements a new tax on vegetable oils  Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said. But he told reporters he did not think the EC would impose the tax because of objections from the U.S.  There's just so much flak coming from many countries  spearheaded by the United States  whose soybean exports would be adversely affected. This would spark a trade war   he said. The tax  to be imposed from July  would add about 375 dlrs a tonne to vegetable oils entering the EC. The Philippines exported 43 540 tonnes of coconut oil worth 11.7 mln dlrs to Europe in January  against total exports of 86 959 tonnes worth 23.8 mln. It also exports copra and copra meal. Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez has also raised objections to the proposed EC tax. He said it could cause the collapse of world demand and prices and destroy the domestic industry."

"2","The new International Cocoa Agreementshould lead to a stabilisation of prices  both benefitting producer countries and promoting an equilibrium in international economic relations  European Community Development Commissioner Lorenzo Natali said. He said in a statement welcoming the agreement on buffer stock rules reached last week in London that it resulted in large part from initiatives taken by the EC Commission after consumers and producers had reached deadlock in initial negotiations."
"2","The buffer stock rules agreement reachedon Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices  many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately  but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.  If the buffer stock operation is successful  I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further  and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices   a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying  or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so  the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically  dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO  into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks  after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market  since prices are below the  must-buy  level of 1 600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement  the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100 000 tonnes within a five week period  but its approach will be more cautious  buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 000 tonnes of cocoa  100 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer.  We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market   Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94 000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However  some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana  whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings  made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa  saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany   Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers.  Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks  and as a result  doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have  delegates said. Under the new rules  the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas  using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1 300 stg per tonne  down from around 1 450 stg in January 1987 and 1 750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it  according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1 600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled  or if the buffer stock runs low on funds  it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12  ICCO officials said."
"2","European Community agricultureministers are today taking their first serious look at farm price proposals for the coming season  but diplomats expect no agreement at the two days of talks. Experts say the proposals put forward last month by the European Commission could lead to a double-digit percentage fall in guaranteed prices for the 1987/88 crop year. Consideration of the price measures comes as farm surpluses and subsidies are set to dominate forthcoming talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT. The talks signal the official start of months of annual wrangling over subsidy levels paid to the EC's 12 mln farmers. Agriculture worldwide is plagued by surplus production and depressed prices  with domestic economic policies largely blamed for the crisis. The U.S. Has signaled it wants the issue of world over-supply pushed to the top of the list of international economic issues to be negotiated this year. EC diplomats say that to a large extent this view is shared in Europe  but the political strength of well-organised farm lobbies leaves ministers with little room for manoeuvre."

"2","The United States does not expectthe executive board meeting of the International Coffee Organization  ICO  to call for a new round of negotiations on reinstating coffee quotas  a U.S. government official said. The official  a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks earlier this year  said no new coffee agreement talks are expected because there is no indication the negotiating positions of major producers and consumers have changed. The U.S. still demands  as a condition of reimposition of coffee quotas  that  objective criteria  be set for establishing quotas  said the U.S. official  who asked not to be identified. Brazil  the major producer  insists on quotas based on a traditional formula. The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if some new flexibility is apparent from major countries  the official said. The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London."
"2","Chances that the International CoffeeOrganization  ICO  executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote  ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile  they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.  Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions  it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage   Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime  he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible  rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations  delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting  the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation  the reintroduction of quotas  verification of stocks and some administrative matters  according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster  Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.  I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting)   Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer  analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life  to September 30  1989. When talks broke down  the U.S. and Brazil  the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively  blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares  under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports  but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using  objective criteria   which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers  Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO  dissident  producers aside  in order to stem the damaging decline in prices  Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However  other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1 276 stg a tonne today  down from around 1 550 at the beginning of March."

"2","World Bank President Barber Conableexpressed concern that trade protectionism  at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan  might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters  Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets  arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth.  We have  in fact  been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time   he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was  a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.  The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium  Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank  which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams  roads and sewers  will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans  in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets  encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy.  We're comfortable with adjustment lending  we expect  however  that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio   Conable said. He made clear  however  that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted   the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.  Conable  is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October  1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based  in part  on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable  and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities.  I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow   Conable said. However  he said  I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.  He said  however  that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency  the International Monetary Fund  was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level  Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that  I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.  He added   so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution.  On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa  Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region  noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations  like those in the Sub-Sahara  during next week's meetings."
"2","The World Bank said it approved a 90mln dlr loan to Yugoslavia's third largest bank to support a project promoting energy conservation and substituting lower-cost energy sources for present sources. It said the loan consists of a credit line to Ljubljanska Banka  Ljubljana (LBL)  to finance a project expected to improve industrial competitiveness and reduce energy imports  easing the country's current balance-of-payments difficulties. The loan will also support development of technical capabilities for energy audit work and strengthen the financial and institutional capability of LBL  the Bank said. The Bank said the project will benefit small and medium-sized industries  primarily in Yugoslavia's Republic of Slovenia. It said 600 000 dlrs of the loan will cover the foreign exchange costs of consultancy services  equipment and training abroad for technical and financial personnel."
"2","President Alan Garcia said he sought todeepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance  possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank. In a televised address tonight  he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans.  We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt   he said. Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings  effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. But tonight Garcia said:  We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others  and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us.  The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr debt. Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year. He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1 260 intis per month  benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln. Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements. He also said the price of petrol  frozen since August 1  1985  would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective. Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue earner  traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos  liquour and cigarettes would also go up  he said  without specifying the amount. Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate. The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80. To encourage private investment  he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government. He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government."
"2","Philippine officials will meet major aiddonors in May to discuss a 500 mln dlr funding for an extensive land reform program  Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said. He told a news conference he had planned to sit down with a consultative group of major donors led by the World Bank late this month in Tokyo but said the documentation of the project would not be ready until the end of this month.  The World Bank has recommended that we meet some time in the second half of May because it is pointless to have that meeting unless the participants have had adequate time to review the documentation   he said. Government officials said the progam  estimated to cost 36 billion pesos  aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land  including some 50 000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. The new plan will include not only rice and corn land but also sugar and coconut plantations. It is expected to benefit about three mln impoverished peasants. Ongpin said earlier there was strong interest in the program from donors but said given the substantial financial requirements of the plan  the government could not rely on only one source but on a combination of sources. President Corazon Aquino approved last month the use of an estimated 20 billion pesos from the proceeds of the sale of certain non-performing assets to private companies. Ongpin said he has asked Aquino to consider two other sources  namely the proceeds from the sale of government corporations which are to be privatised and proceeds from the liquidation of seized Marcos-related assets. He also said he would recommend public hearings before such a big project was legislated.  If we get a good reception in the public hearings  perhaps then the President might feel persuaded that it is not necessary to wait for the Congress   he said. Aquino had said she would prefer that legislation for the program be approved by a two-house Congress  whose members will be elected on May 11. But her advisers are trying to persuade her to implement the program before the Congress convenes in July."
"2","British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership  has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election  due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson  in answer to a question  told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism  there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered  he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system  he noted.  We have to make sure it would work.  But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency  which he said was diminishing.  That argument has clearly weakened   he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review."
"2","European Community (EC)finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence  officials said.  There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System  with all that implies   Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency  the West German mark  sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable  both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister  whose country presently holds the presidency of the community  made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration.  We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system   Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to  dedramatise  realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However  West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany  with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul."
"2","Western creditorgovernments have reached agreement in principle on new proposals for easing the debt burden of sub-Saharan African countries  British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He told journalists the accord  reached in the so-called Paris Club of western governments  calls for rescheduling the debts of sub-Saharan African countries over very long periods and on very favourable terms. The proposals will be put forward for discussion at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank Development Committee in Washington next week  he said. Lawson said that under the proposals countries could have 15 or 20 years to repay their debts along with have a grace period. But he added the favourable terms would not be offered indiscriminately to all nations in the region but granted on a case-by-case basis. The Paris Club groups Western governments -- as opposed to commercial banks -- which are owed money by poorer nations. Lawson was speaking after an informal gathering of European Community finance ministers and central bankers held to prepare for discussions on international monetary issues and Third World debt at next week's spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he had insisted at the gathering that developed countries take adequate account of the problems facing poorer nations that were trying to put their ailing economies in order. He told journalists he would be unveiling new proposals for dealing with the Third World debt problem in  Washington. He declined to give details but Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens  who hosted the talks  indicated that Balladur's proposals involved giving a greater role to a World Bank fund used to compensate developing countries for falls in the prices of their main commodities.  The French ideas got a very sympathetic welcome   Eyskens told a news conference. He said the European Community felt a new IMF (International Monetary Fund) report which forecasts inflation-adjusted economic growth of just 2.5 pct in the industrialised world this year  compared with 3.1 pct expected last autumn  was slightly too pessimistic. Many economists believe industrialised countries need to grow by at least three pct a year if the world debt is to be brought under control. Eyskens added the Community wanted to give  certain nuances  to the IMF report that would be constructive for dealing with the Third World debt problem. However  Italian sources quoted Italian Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria as calling it scandalous that the meeting here did not include a discussion of what he called the problem of falling world demand. He complained that West Germany was refusing to do enough to boost demand while the United States  suffering from a massive trade deficit  was unable to do anything in this direction."

"2","Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986  the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd  the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels  as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986  the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct  it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels  some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens  natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986  and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes  representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw  particulary for March  it said. As crude production also fell  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks  particularly at sea  the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising  more or less in line with consumption  after declining for five years  the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1  down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption  respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1  down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies  the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter  plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs  compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd  against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline  the IEA said. Saudi Arabia s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd."

But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986  the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.

The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400 000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw  particulary for March  it said. As crude production also fell  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks  particularly at sea  the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies  the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline  the IEA said."
"2","Philippine coffee exports are expectedto fall sharply due to a combination of the International Coffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive export quotas and higher local prices  ICO Certifying Agency official Dante de Guzman told Reuters. He said exporter registrations dropped from an average weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week  with exports in coffee year 1986/87  ending September  forecast to total about 8 000 tonnes against 48 000 in 1985/86.  Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices  it has become difficult to service exports   de Guzman said  adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude. Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June from 1.1 mln bags last year  he said."
"2","Leading cocoa producers will discusswhether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four day's of talks here later today  conference sources said. Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices. The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June  and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue  the sources said. Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month  CPA secretary general D.S. Kamga said. The 11-member CPA include the world's top three producers of Ivory Coast  Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct of world output."
"2","An extension of the International TinAgreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed to lapse  Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told reporters. Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of the International Tin Council on April 8-9  Subroto said Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look into how to replace the pact. But he said that given the present disagreement between producers and consumers  there is unlikely to be any follow-up to the ITA. Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension of the ITA  he said   No one will propose that. It's also unrealistic to do so.  Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to introduce a quota system which limited their exports and consumption to 96 000 tonnes in the year starting March 1. Indonesia's quota was set at 24 516 tonnes."
"2","Indonesian Energy minister Subroto saidhe was very confident of continued stability in the oil market because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a price of 18 dlrs a barrel.  We are very confident that things will continue this way. The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution of Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price   he said at a signing ceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement. He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels  and he expected prices to firm slightly in the third quarter of the year. He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June  members will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and seeing prices rise a bit  or raising the production ceiling so that members could produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He gave no figures for how much he thought volume could be raised without undermining the 18 dlr target  or any indication of which option he preferred."
"2","Japanese oil traders generally expect oilprices to remain steady through June  when the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting is scheduled to take place. Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a month  despite coming under considerable pressure in February as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly resist paying official prices  trade sources said. Despite these attempts  spot crude rose steadily to stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target  they said. Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month  mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its 15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members would submit to pressure to discount prices  oil traders said. However  Opec's discipline in holding its price and output targets eventually forced many of the buyers back  they said. Countries such as Qatar  Iran and Iraq refused to bend to demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting from Japanese buyers. The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels to store its production rather than cut its prices  they said. Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd  1.2 mln below its ceiling  with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd  the Middle East Economic Survey estimated.  Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to destroy the market   an oil trader in Tokyo said. Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes  but these trades have not generated sufficient volume to depress the market  he said. The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20 to 25 cts below official prices  so resistance to buying crude under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be weaker  traders said. Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly  or raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987."

"2","Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986  the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels per day  the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels  as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986  the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct  it said."
"2","European Community unemployment fellslightly in February to just under 17 mln from 17.1 mln in January  the EC statistic's agency Eurostat said. It said the fall came despite a bad winter in most of the EC when seasonal factors could be expected to have had a more adverse effect. However  the agency added  the long-term trend was virtually unchanged stating that compared to February 1986 the number of registered unemployed increased by 222 000."
"2","The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said ithad approved two loans amounting to 75.7 mln dollars for agricultural projects in Bangladesh and Nepal. It said both loans are repayable over 40 years  including a 10-year grace  and carry a service charge of one pct a year. The bank said it approved 51.7 mln for an agricultural inputs program for Bangladesh aimed at sustaining foodgrain production. It said the loan will cover the entire foreign exchange component of the project's total cost of 65 mln. The ADB said it approved 24 mln dlrs to support an agricultural credit project in Nepal. The loan will benefit Nepal by increasing foodgrain output  augmenting production of milk and other dairy products and expanding energy generation in rural areas  it said."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks  cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75 000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly  given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1 578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne  below the 1 600  must buy  level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations  traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 600 SDR  must buy  level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second  third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1 577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May  July and September  but these are set to change to July  September and December on April 15  prior to May becoming the New York spot month  traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average  the indicator which governs his activities  traders said.  The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa   an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75 000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months  buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50 000 and 70 000 tonnes  compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94 000 tonnes  traders said. In these circumstances  the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes to lift prices above the  must buy  level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action  dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member  while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day  which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material  traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures  but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures. Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying  dealers said.  The buffer stock may not help the terminal market  but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas   one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were  all prognostication  and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices  but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus  dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism."
"2","Finance ministers from African countriesin the French franc currency zone called for more aid from the international banking community at a meeting here last Friday  the French finance ministry said in a statement. The talks  held to prepare for this week's International Monetary Fund interim committee meeting in Washington  underlined that a considerable decline in bank aid to developing nations was a major source of worry. The ministers noted that this decline was contrary to expectations on debt strategy which emerged from the October 1985 IMF general assembly in Seoul.  Even if to a certain extent the efforts of banks can be helped out by those of private investors  the contribution of the international banking community remains indispensable   the statement said. They underlined the need  given present circumstances  for a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to relieve tensions on the exchange reserves of numerous developing countries  the statement added without elaborating."
"2","Industrial production in the EuropeanCommunity (EC) in January showed no growth compared with January 1986  the EC statistics office  Eurostat  said in a report. It said the EC industrial production index  base 1980  stood at 103.9 in both months. EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the EC in January  it also reflects a worrying trend. Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures are known  industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with the year-earlier period. Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about 1.8 pct  well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12 months ending last June  the office said."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerholds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today  to urge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed their economic growth. Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making agreements to coordinate economic policies more binding. The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of the Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy and Canada to form the Group of Seven. The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of the United States  Japan  West Germany  France and Britain. The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to reaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic growth  reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies. Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is expected after the meeting ends. These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the same time  monetary sources say they expect Baker to put forward proposals  originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo Summit  to tighten procedures for policy coordination. Washington wants other major nations to establish specific policy goals for economic growth  inflation  current account balance of payments  trade balances  budget performance  monetary conditions and currencies. If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such objectives  then countries should consult on whether corrective action is necessary  the proposal says. Monetary sources said there was some support for the proposal  which may not be made final until the Venice Economic Summit in June  but Britain and West Germany were firmly against any attempt to make corrective action automatic. The U.S. Treasury team  led by Baker  has worked on this plan since last September  when it won the support of France. Baker  meanwhile  will press Japan and West Germany to live up to their commitments  made over six weeks ago in Paris  to boost their domestic demand to absorb more imports. He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the Reagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a significant budget deficit cut this year  helping to depress U.S. demand for imports. The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge imbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the one hand  and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other. Japan  in particular  is under pressure to come up with a meaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen. Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go higher against the dollar  a development that has become unacceptable in Japan. The Paris Agreement  by the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain and Canada  called for currencies to be stabilized around current levels. But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the agreement was reached  and its present stability is said to be temporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks. Meanwhile  representatives of the leading Third World countries continue preparing their position for their ministers to present to industrial nations later this week. Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing nations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the western strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure. They call instead for vast new assistance from the industrial world and a much greater role for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."

"2","The United States has appealed forstronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules. The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade. Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round  which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture  manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate. Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.  The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy   Smith said.  Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak  or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.  He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies. Smith  who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials  told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.  We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings   he said. GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement. President Reagan  who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade  has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods. He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports."
"2","The African Development Bank (ADB) saidit increased its lending by 42.1 pct last year to 1.64 billion dlrs from 1.15 billion dlrs in 1985. A bank statement said agriculture  set as the main growth area in a five-year economic recovery program adopted in 1985 by African states  received 607 mln dlrs  37 pct of the total. The ADB is made up of the bank itself  its financing soft-loan arm  the African Development Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund  another soft-loan institution. ADB president Babacar N'Diaye released a 1987 economic report on Africa prepared by the ADB and the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  saying progress was being made toward substantial increases in the bank's capital resources. He said an ad-hoc committee of the ADB board of governors  comprising 18 African and non-African countries  recommended a 200 pct increase in the organisation's capital for 1987-91. He said such an increase would raise capital from around 6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs  adding he was hopeful the proposal would be adopted at the annual meetings of the bank and fund  due to be held jointly in Cairo in June. He welcomed France's recent proposals to the Paris Club of Western government creditors to extend repayment periods for Third World debts and give better rescheduling terms.  The proposition represents a major step forward. But African countries should not be the ones to ask for large-scale debt write-offs   he said. Africa's total external debt was estimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986. The ECA-ADB report said prospects would remain bleak for African economies in 1987 but predicted Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct  compared with 1.2 pct last year."
"2","The European Commission has not taken adecision on applications from the British government for the release of 200 000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June  Commission sources said. They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70 000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30 000 tonnes from April 23. However  it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later. The British government had applied for the release of a further 100 000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising. However  the sources said  the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval. The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market  the sources noted. Following last week's committee meeting  the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100 000 tonnes  depending on the state of the market. This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300 000 tonnes during the three months of April  May and June at last week's meeting."
"2","Yugoslavia  which refinanced part ofits 19.7 billion dlr debt in talks with creditor governments last week  has begun talks with banks on rescheduling its commercial debt  the official Tanjug news agency said. The talks began in Washington yesterday and Tanjug said the general attitude of the banks was  favourable.  At the same time  other Tanjug reports showed Yugoslavia is having difficulties in obtaining a 600 mln ECU loan from the European Community (EC) and in receiving money owed to Yugoslav firms by Middle Eastern countries. The Western creditor governments and Kuwait agreed on March 31 to refinance 475 mln dlrs of Yugoslavia's debt due in 1987 and 1988. This made possible the talks with commercial banks. Tanjug said sources close to the Yugoslav delegation said the initial reaction of commercial banks was favourable despite their continued insistence on  technical and legal elements.  It said it was believed that a commercial debt rescheduling would be formally agreed in the next few weeks. Bank debt accounts for about 70 pct of Yugoslavia's overall debt  which stood at 19.7 billion dlrs at end-1986. Tanjug said Yugoslavia also discussed with its commercial creditors the idea of converting some of Yugoslavia's debt into joint venture investments but it gave no details of this. It said Deputy Finance Minister Boris Skapin was holding talks on this with representatives of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.  Which coordinates the interests of several hundred banks in Yugoslav debt negotiations. In a separate report Tanjug said the EC has so far refused a Yugoslav request for a 600 mln ECU infrastuctural loan and a 100 mln ECU grant from the EC budget. The EC had so far only agreed to provide 380 mln ECUs towards transport modernisation. It said Yugoslav Finance Minister Svetozar Rikanovic yesterday met World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials in Washington. It said the World Bank agreed that infrastructural projects in Yugoslavia should be accelerated and structural adjustment loans should be agreed this year."
"2","Japan will seek to strengthen theParis accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow  Japanese officials said. However  the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified  would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord  which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February  to be strengthened. Currency target zones  or reference ranges  will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow  the Japanese officials said. The meeting  which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions  will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord  the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates  officials said  but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan  which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency  but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus  Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7  the officials said. However  Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet  or parliament  despite the new fiscal year which started April one  the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5 000 billion yen in additional spending."
"2","Dutch Finance Minister Onno Rudingsaid there was a growing feeling in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that commercial banks and debtor countries should take a greater lead in assembling new financing packages.  The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put together large packages like Mexico   Ruding told reporters in a briefing on this week's semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks. Ruding  who is also chairman of the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee  said he was reflecting a feeling within the two institutions. Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling the institutions were being unduly pressured by the Reagan administration  Ruding replied  we should not go in the direction of politicisation of the two institutions.  Ruding said  no country large or small should push in that direction.   He said he expected commercial bank lending to debtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace of lending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any major initiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in the debt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debt crisis itself. In other remarks  Ruding said many countries supported a General Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expected Bank president Barber Conable also to express his support. The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present. Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would support the use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance but would stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automatic consultations if indicators were sharply out of line with policy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggested establishing  norms  or automatic triggers for consultations among industrial states if policies deviate from plan. Currently the plan also has the support of France  the Netherlands and Italy while Britain  Japan and West Germany are all opposed."

Spain and Portugal  which are not members of the International Tin Council  raised no objections to a common EC stance in favour."
"2","The outcome of today's European Community(EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after last week's substantial award of 102 350 tonnes at the highest ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos  traders said. Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller  at around 60 000 tonnes  but declined to give a view on the likely restitution. Last week  the European Commission accepted 785 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining factor in today's result  they added."
"2","The European Community (EC) is expected toaward export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60 000 and possibly up to 100 000 tonnes of white sugar after last week's award for 102 350 tonnes  traders here said. They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 Ecus per 100 kilos  compared to last week's 46.864. Earlier  traders in London said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award and the placing of 785 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60 000 but declined to give a rebate figure."
"2","West Germany should take steps to increaseits official development assistance  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. A report by the organisation's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) said German aid levels had shown only a moderate increase in real terms in recent years  adding that there was a risk that growth over the next few years might slow further. German aid  estimated at around four billion dlrs in 1986  represents 0.46 pct of the country's GNP. This is above the DAC's average of 0.36 pct  but might decline if corrective measures were not taken  the report said."
"2","A sharp oil price decline and sharpfluctuations of exchange and interest rates in 1986 produced a mixed economic performance by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  a United Nations study said. The annual report of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said the international economic environment reversed the fortunes of the trade-oriented economies of the six ASEAN member countries. It said the already low 1985 growth rates of ASEAN's oil exporting countries -- Brunei  Malaysia and Indonesia -- dropped further after the oil price fall. Three oil importers -- Singapore  the Philippines and Thailand -- improved their performance mainly by restructuring their economies. But the report said the oil price fall reduced export earnings  worsening economic prospects for the exporters. The exporters' non-oil commodity prices did not show major improvement and protectionist pressures from industrial countries restricted export of manufactured products  it said. The GDPs of Indonesia  which was 1.9 pct in 1985  and Malaysia  which fell a real one pct  barely grew in 1986. The two countries  buffeted by unfavourable external factors in the past few years  were forced to curb aggregate domestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balance of payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercial borrowings. The U.N. Body said the economic outlooks of Singapore  Thailand and the Philippines improved steadily in 1986 as the year advanced. It said the most favourable factor benefiting the three was the realignment of key currencies  especially the appreciation of the yen  which has resulted in the increased competitiveness of their exports against those from Japan. The report said the downward spiral plaguing the Philippine economy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct GDP growth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becoming growth sectors. It said the resumption of the Philippines' sustained growth rests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem. ESCAP said the yen appreciation  together with economic restructuring measures  played a big role in helping Singapore recover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct GDP decline in 1985. It said the Singapore GDP achieved a growth of over one pct last year after registering positive growth from the second quarter. The Singapore economic revival was hampered by its own adjustment measures especially its two-year wage freeze enforced last April  a glut of its property market and depressed conditions in its ASEAN neighbours which hurt Singapore because they take about a quarter of its total exports. The report said Thailand benefited from the changing world economic environment far more than any of its ASEAN neighbours. The Thai performance stemmed from the expansion o&#127; its non-traditional export items last year to cover more manufactured products and its greater exploration of unsaturated export markets such as Asia  the Middle East and the European Community."

"2","The Zambian government has no immediateplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal  an official of the ruling party said. Last December  a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal  a Zambian staple  led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase  which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked  followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill. However  if the producer price rise  from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag  is not accompanied by a retail price increase  the government will have to spend more on subsidies  a practice discouraged by the IMF.  There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people   a Ministry of Agriculture economist said."
"2","World output of staple foods maintainedgrowth in 1986  following a record harvest the year before  and most of the increase was in developing countries  the director general of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAO's committee on world food security  Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide  many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need  he said. Saouma said many of the developing world's food problems were the result of  chaotic  world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the  food-security situation  of the poor  with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth."

Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan rates  committee staff said.  Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally   one source said. De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with Japan's restrictive rice import policy  and members defended the U.S. dairy policy  which aims to cut surplus production by subsidizing producers to trim herds  sources said. Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis. Tomorrow  De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee  before visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng. De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in the key GATT member states. The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting in February and is expected to meet again in May."
"2","Discussions on the possible extension ofthe sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member states. A number of producer governments in particular have not decided their final position on whether the ITA should be extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on June 30  according to delegate sources. Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to back an extension  with the exception of Britain  which undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later. Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member countries declare their positions on the possible extension. Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC coordination meeting. The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow  although delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor technical matters and the main issue will probably not be discussed before the afternoon session."
"2","Controversial plans to payWestern Europe's surplus-producing farmers generous cash grants to leave the land ran into problems at today's weekly meeting of the European Community (EC) Commission  officials said. They said the 17-member Commission  which effectively runs the Community on a day-to-day basis  appeared divided over the proposals which some people argue could lead to national capitals having too much say in EC farm policies. EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing paying farmers as much as 2 800 dlrs a year over five years to leave the land. EC member states would be permitted to top up payments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the average national farm income. The package would also include an early retirement scheme  details of which have yet to be unveiled. Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy -- the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted food production -- more acceptable to countries with large farming communities. With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budget swallowed up by EC farm supports  he argues that in the long-run the payments would lead to considerable savings."
"2","Brazilian Finance Minister DilsonFunaro  who suspended interest payments to creditor banks two months ago  said creditors had to trust him when he said Brazil would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue servicing its debt. Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy  Funaro said he would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outside his country  but added   At the same time we show credibility  you (the banks) are going to have to trust us.  Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancing needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the International Monetary Fund  Funaro said   What other options do they have?...They have to try to see our program.  Funaro  who is in Washington to attend the Interim Committee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bank and IMF  said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the major creditor banks in New York yesterday. According to Funaro  the creditor banks  agreed on the need to find a solution to the crisis.  He did not elaborate. Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's need for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that Brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net capital that it transferred over the past three years. He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs to ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11 billion dlr trade surplus until 1991. Administration officials familiar with the negotiations said Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense based on current conditions in that country  and added that they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead. Lewis Preston  chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc.  told Reuters he remains hopeful that Brazil and its foreign bank creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the end of the year. But Preston  who did not attend the meeting between Funaro and creditor banks yesterday  added the onus is still on Brazil to put its economic house in order first.  They haven't even come up with a plan yet   Preston said after Morgan's annual meeting in New York today. Funaro  however  said most creditor banks had representatives in Brazil who were well aware of Brazil's new economic measures  designed to curb a surge in inflation and spending and a sharp drop in exports. Funaro called Brazil's program very responsible and very strong  adding that  it is very different from other years  there has been a tremendous change.  Based on Brazil's current economic situation - suspension of interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks  200 pct inflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans every year until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options.

"2","The Agriculture Ministry declined commenton a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.  We have no idea about the report and cannot comment   a spokesman told Reuters. Nihon Keizai Shinbun  quoting unnamed government sources  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks. The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum. Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act. Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks  Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified  it said. The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate."
"2","Following is the text of a statementby the Group of Seven -- the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday. 1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today. They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting. 2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement. They agreed  however  that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures  sustain global economic expansion  and reduce trade imbalances. In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years  as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures. The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services. 3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting. In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement. They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates."
"2","China is likely to succeed in joiningGATT despite policies that contradict free trade  because western countries support its entry  western diplomats said. China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation  formed in 1948 to integrate the world's free market economies  now regulates 80 pct of world trade. The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and complex entry negotiations  the diplomats said. One diplomat said China's prospects are good  with its application supported by the United States  Japan and the European Community for political and economic reasons.  The fear is that if China was refused entry  it would draw back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was   he said. Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.  If GATT accepted China  it would be hard not to accept the Soviet Union   he said.  China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body.  But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks  including China's pricing system and trade subsidies. GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and promote trade  with prices alone dictating who buys what. One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state and often contain subsidies.  Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try to find out the real cost of something  officials do not give you a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do not want to answer   he said. China's position  as set out in a memorandum to GATT in February  is that it is gradually reforming its price system to bring prices in line with real production costs and replace administrative controls with market ones. Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However  China would not apply for membership on similar terms  but rather as a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment. He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are small  while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.  It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal  for instance   the diplomat said.  It could have a very large impact on world trade.  Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its companies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for vitally needed technology  equipment and raw materials. A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of grain it exported  because it had to make up the difference between a low world price and a high domestic price. A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade bureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies might be as high as 100 pct for some products.  When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole country  he referred me to the Ministry of Finance  adding with a grin that they would not tell me   he said. He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of the sensitivity of the subject.  Unless something is done to change this  China will find many countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from China   the diplomat added. In a major speech on the economy late last month  Planning Minister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.  While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign exchange  we must improve economic accounting practices and reduce the cost of exports   he said. One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign trade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT principles could conflict with domestic pressures. China has said there will be no major price reforms this year following widespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to stable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.  So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China reform its economy?   the diplomat said.  How can it balance the requirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?  But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the end outweigh these problems.  China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a part of the world economy   he said.  Just as China would get increased access to foreign markets  so it would have to give more access to its domestic market to foreign countries."
"2","The maximum export rebate granted atyesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community  EC Commission sources said. The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118 350 tonnes of sugar  down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week  but the change is explained by world market conditions. Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos  and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week  the sources said. They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low. Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy  they said."

"2","The European Community launched aninvestigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains. Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S. The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices. Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market  up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese. The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation  which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified. The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market."

"2","The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand. FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1 353 mln in 1987  due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union  drought in China and reduced plantings in North America. World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes  softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed  with about 50 pct held by the U.S.  Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries  particularly in Africa  depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests   FAO said. FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2 113 mln tonnes  about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest  estimated at 1 865 mln tonnes. FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union."

In a statement  the EC's executive authority also spelled out tough demands it will be putting to carriers in talks on liberalising EC air transport and bringing down airfares  warning that new legal moves were possible if they refused to comply. As a first step  the Commission wanted the 10 carriers to eliminate the most serious distortions of competition caused by the current practices and agreements.

"2","The global economy is expected toweaken this year  adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook  economic analysts said. For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank  the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year  versus 2.9 pct last year  and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries  Gross National Product  a measure of all goods and services  was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year  compared with 2.4 pct in 1986  the IMF said. For the developing countries  the Gross Domestic Product  another measure of economic growth  was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt. IMF officials  discussing their outlook  said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance  economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries  including the very poorest states  have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange  including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy  which is in its fifth year of expansion  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports  but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year  growing by only 2.3 pct  according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit  the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up  although it has been much slower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that  it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.  The report added  however   the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.  REUTER^M &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"

"2","Britain  France and other Europeannations will make a strong plea in high-level meetings today for urgent debt relief for the very poorest countries  European monetary sources said. The request will be put to the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee  which meets here as part of semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks. But it is likely to run into opposition from the United States  which regards debt relief  even for the world's poorest nations in Sub-Saharan Africa  with distaste.  If all creditors agreed  (Britain and France) would be prepared to consider below market interest rates   for the countries  one source said. A senior U.S. Treasury official poured cold water on the plan earlier this week  however.  We are not willing to enter into arrangements that would forgive debt or provide concessional interest rates   the official said. At the heart of the American objection is the fear that once such a concession is made for the very poorest nations  then sooner or later Latin debtors will be demanding similar relief. African nations owe foreign creditors  most of them governments  over 70 billion dlrs. Over 21 billion dlrs is debt owed by poorest Sub-Saharan African nations. In addition to interest rate concessions  the sources said European countries wanted repayment of these loans to be stretched out for up to 20 years  with a substantial delay before capital repayments start. The issue was inconclusively discussed in yesterday's meetings of the major industrial nations -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  Britain  France  Italy and Canada. It is already under consideration by the Paris Club of western creditor nations  to which the United States belongs.  There are quite obviously differences about it   one source said of the American attitude.  But it is perfectly clear that (debt repayment) is an abiding problem for a small number of the poorest countries.  The plan would also involve the conversion of bilateral aid to these countries into outright grants  a policy already adopted by Paris and London. REUTER^M &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee  Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have  now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.  Baker said   These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly  and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels.  As they are today  the trade and current account imbalances  simply are not sustainable   Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was resisting  strong domestic pressure  for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.  While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome  we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist   he said. Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall.  We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary   he said."

"2","French Finance Minister EdouardBalladur said that the financial community is closer to arriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite the fact that little is being said about them. Speaking with reporters at the semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund  Balladur said   We are not very far from the notion of target zones  even if we don't say so.  He told reporters that  our ideas are progressing   adding that the finance ministers have been talking about more cooperation on economic policies and on levels around which currencies should stabilize."
"2","The United States will push for astrong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June economic summit in Venice  urging  comprehensive  negotiations on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm subsidies  the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.  Agriculture has really become the number one international economic problem   Allen Wallis  undersecretary of state for economic affairs  told Reuters in an interview. At the Tokyo economic summit last year  western leaders identified agriculture as a major international problem but made no specific recommendations. This year  Wallis said the U.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to begin negotiating on the issue  and include domestic programs. While the Western leaders  including president Reagan  will not conduct specific negotiations  Wallis said they can give a push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

"2","The European Commission was authorisedto buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores in the second half of June  although sales into intervention normally end on April 30  Commission sources said. They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC and the United States. The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years. The sources said the intervention price for the maize would be 201.49 Ecus a tonne. They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April 30 deadline  which could be caused by speculation about the implementation of the accord with the United States."

Wallis said the leaders should endorse a  comprehensive  negotiation  which is interpreted as including domestic policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.  They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic policies  as well as trade arrangements   Wallis said. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit statement of support for agriculture talks is part of an overall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm talks. Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the Reagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue. Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will repeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting next week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda of the trade ministers  quadrilateral  talks among Japan  the European Community  the U.S. and Canada this month. And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  in May will highlight the agriculture problem  Yeutter said. The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic farm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies among industrial countries  but aid to farmers is also generous in the EC and United States. The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm subsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent  PSE  which allows farm aid to be compared across countries. Some officials including British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling  have said the PSE could be useful as a method of negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide. However  the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE can be useful in negotiations  it has shortcomings and  its not definitive.  He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration has not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture proposal to present to the GATT.  I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall   after the series of international meetings  Wallis said. At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee  the United States has pushed for the so-called  freeze and rollback  approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current levels  then rolled-back jointly in stages. However  the Reagan administration perplexed some trade analysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian prime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke unveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce the gap between high farm price supports and world prices. Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13 coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.  The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming up with seem to be focusing on short-run  quick fixes which is not what we think is what's called for here   Wallis said. Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a  long-range  solution to the agriculture problem. U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal because they said it deals primarily with the difference between domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.  but fails to focus on the question of market access. At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian  quick fix   Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for a declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed  expeditiously   or within two years. The unstated U.S. strategy  U.S. officials said  is to keep the pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement program and lower value of the dollar  in the hope that a sweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988."

"2","Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman AkioMorita played down the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict  saying that direct investment abroad was the most effective way to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Morita was speaking at the official opening of a 100 million franc (16.4 million dollars) compact disc player factory in eastern France. He said trade friction between the U.S. And Japan over high-technology was a very complicated and delicate issue but that Sony intended to invest directly throughout the world. Referring to the European Community's stance against turnkey plants  he said:  I know Brussels is not very favourable to these so-called new Japanese 'screwdriver factories'  but in Sony's case our policy is quite different.  The Colmar plant  Sony's third in France  would eventually use local components and be a purely French factory  he said. Sony France SA was established in 1973. Its 1986 sales were two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says it expects sales of 2.7 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987. Sony's other two French plants  in the south west of the country  export over 80 per cent of their production. Company officials say that production from Sony's European factories currently accounts for over 30 per cent of the group's European sales and they expect this to increase. In 1986 over 20 per cent of Sony's eight billion dollar worldwide sales were made in Europe. At the beginning of 1987  Sony employed about 1 100 people in Europe. The group plans to open a compact disc software factory in Austria this summer and an audio cassette plant in Italy next year."
"2","Zimbabwe's beef exports to the EuropeanCommunity (EC)  potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year  may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland  industry sources said. The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee  which is considering a formal ban. The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe  threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.  The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports   one industry source said yesterday. Commenting on EC policy  he explained   Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options  allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas  clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision   he added  asking not to be identified. Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8 100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules. Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports  the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices  the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result  he said."

This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek further clarification on some of the issues involved  and to discuss internal matters. Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.

"2","Brazilian Finance Minister DilsonFunaro shrugged off demands by a group of Brazilian governors that he resign.  At this moment I am discussing something much more serious for Brazil and it's absolutely indispensible in a negotiation like this one that I dedicate myself entirely to the discussions   Funaro told reporters. Funaro  who spoke today to the International Monetary Fund's interim committee  was referring to talks he began Tuesday with creditor banks in New York in which unveiled Brazil's economic targets and financial needs. The governor of Sao Paulo state Orestes Quersia and other governors last night called on Brazilian President Jose Sarney to assume direct control of the debt negotiations. Asked if the governors' demands for his resignation would affect negotiations  Funaro said:  We are building a new refinancing position and that is what we are doing now. The rest is secondary.  He added that Brazil's economic program clearly demonstrates the intention to renegotiate the countries international financial committments  and added:  The domestic problems are our business.  Funaro said discussions on Brazil's refinancing proposals were well under way with private creditor banks and added World Bank President Barber Conable had also accepted the proposals as  a good plan  at a meeting they had last night. But Conable  who was also present at today's IMF interim committee meeting told reporters that the World Bank wanted further clarifications on Brazil's economic programs.  We wish further clarification about the program with respect to adjustment lending   Conable said. He added that a World Bank mission would travel to Brazil early next week to explore the state of Brazil's new economic measures."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage the prospects for growth and adjustment and called for cooperation in exchange markets. In a statement to the International Monetary Funds Interim Committee  Miyazawa said it was imperative that current account surplus countries follow policies designed to strengthen domestic demand and reduce surpluses while maintaining price stability. He said Japan intended to carry out policies announced at the Paris meeting of finance ministers to stimulate its economy. Miyazawa said that  given the massive external imbalances and serious unemployment in some countries   there are very real fears of a protectionist uprising.  In addition   we are most concerned about this very serious problem of exchange rate instability   Miyazawa said."

"2","The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s  according to John H. Lichtblau  president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau  speaking at an alternative energy conference here  said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995  surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977.  The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable   Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations  he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990.  However  the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction   Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.  An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone   Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil  Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices  he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling  to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy."
"2","Argentina's Economy Minister JuanSourrouille said the  narrow interest  of creditor banks was holding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warned Argentina may break off negotiations.  It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of some banks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for a policy we have agreed with the international community   Sourrouille said. Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee meeting  Sourrouille said Argentina had given ample proof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.  Today  with that same responsibility  we are clearly stating that it will be imposible for us to continue negotiating on that basis.  A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from a vantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  said Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the names of banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.  Let's give them a call right away   the source quoted Baker as saying. Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMF last February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and a longer-term credit  known as an extended Fund Facility for another 500 000 dlrs. But he said that despite Argentina's  disciplined effort  to achieve inflation-free economic growth  it was unable to obtain IMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement and settlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks. Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting a long-established practice under which debtor countries which reached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were a good credit risk for the banks.  In other words  facts are demonstrating that the current debt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weak signal for the beginning of another discussion (with the banks)   he stated. He added the fact that the strategy is not working was also demonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's program had to join in a bridge loan for his country. Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirements regarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscal policies. Despite this Sourrouille said   What we are facing is the inexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blocking negotations.  Argentina  with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs  has been seeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in  old debt  and another 4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985. The minister also said there were two issues separating Argentina from an accord with creditor banks  one was a minimum difference on the interest rate margin above international levels. The other condition  of more concern  were suggestions by the banks that would upset the country's financial system. Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offering Argentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct  which they gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement. The sources said Argentina is committed to winning the lower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee  Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.  But I do suggest   he said   that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts.  He said that indicators can serve  as a kind of compass  but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker  however  said the IMF  needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.  The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public.  In particular  we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations  the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations  and greater use of special consultation procedures   he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device  for moving beyond rhetoric to action.  He said they provide  more structure to the system  and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.  He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.  This should be matter of priority for the executive board   he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that  can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances  by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.  He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.  If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course  then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables   he said."
"2","For the second time in sevenweeks  the United States and Britain vetoed a Security Council resolution to impose mandatory sanctions against South Africa. Nine of the Council's 15 members voted for the draft  aimed at forcing South Africa to implement an eight-year-old  U.N. independence plan for Namibia (South West Africa)  a vast  sparsely populated territory rich in minerals. The U.S. and Britain were joined by West Germany in casting negative votes. France  Italy and Japan abstained. The resolution called for comprehensive mandatory sanctions because Pretoria insists on making Namibian independence conditional on the withdrawal of more than 30 000 Cuban troops from neighbouring Angola."
"2","The European Community has toldCongress that if textile legislation injuring EC interests is approved  there was no doubt the community would retaliate against U.S. exports. Roy Denmam  head of the EC delegation here  issued the warning in a letter to Senator Lloyd Bentsen  chairman of the Finance Committee. A copy of the letter was provided Reuters. Denmam told Bentsen  a Texas Democrat  that if the textile legislation passed on its own or was included in an omnibus trade bill and injured EC interests   there should be no doubt that the EC will retaliate against the United States.  He added that  at a time when U.S. textile exports to the EC are growing rapidly  one result of such retaliation would be a substantial reduction of U.S. exports and jobs.  The textile legislation  backed strongly by the industry  hard hit by imports  and by senators from textile-producing states would impose new tough global quotas on textile imports and for the first time include Europe in the quotas. Reagan Administration officials have also opposed the textile legislation  saying that if it passed it would likely prompt a presidential veto. Denman made his comments on the textile issue in a general assessment of the Senate trade bill  titled S.490. He said he was concerned about provisions in the Senate bill that would limit  if not eliminate  the president's discretion if retaliating against nations for keeping their home markets closed to foreign goods. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has also opposed those provisions  arguing that presidential flexibility was needed in order to be able to negotiate with countries to open their markets  with retaliation being retained as a final  but discretionary  weapon. The pending overall trade legislation would force the Administration to consult often with Congress and seek its approval during step-by-step GATT negotiations. He said  enactment of S. 490 would reduce the confidence of other governments in America's commitment to multinational trade.  Summing up the senate legislation  Denman said  a number of provisions of that bil may achieve the opposite of what is intended and lead to dangerous consequences for the world and the U.S. economy."
"2","The French government said itproposed the creation of a new facility for development and for debt reduction under the framework of the World Bank. In a statement issued in conjunction with the meeting of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee  the French said the  multilateral resources thus collected would permit a partial refinancing on highly concessional terms of previously rescheduled official debts.  The statement said the  French government believes it is necessary to take new steps to deal with the issue of the poorest countries' debt.  The French statement said that Paris club reschedulings should have a lengthening of the repayment period up to between 15 and 20 years instead of the current limit of 10 years. And grace periods would be extended.  These measures would be confined to the poorest  heavily indebted countries and would be decided on a case-by-case basis   it said. The French also called for making the IMF's compensatory financing facility for export shortfalls more concessional."

"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat commercial banks need to develop more flexibility in their concerted lending mechanisms  to help assure continued participation in new money packages.  He said that major debtor nations need to be able to count on receiving timely disbursements on new loans essential to support well-conceived economic programs. His remarks were made to the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee. Baker said   The sense of urgency and willingness to cooperate in support of a larger general interest that helped to carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and 1983 is now less evident.  He said to address this problem  it is important for the commercial banks to  develop a menu of alternative new money options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose in providing continuing support for debtor reforms.  He said the  continued implementation of the debt strategy may well rest on their doing so.  Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest income countries remain an issue of  critical concern to the United States.  He said that he intended to address the problem of poor country prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting of the joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee. Baker said  however  that ministers should guard against what appear to be magical solutions to the complex debt problem.  I want to stress the need for all to guard against the ephemeral attraction of magical solutions  which may appear as tantalizing alternatives to the rigorous realities of grappling with our debt problems   he said. But he emphasized that the only lasting progress is to approach each situation on a case-by-case basis   bringing to bear the policies and financing needed to bring the economy back to sustained economic growth."

Noting that a shortage of power constrains Pakistan's economic development  the Bank said one objective of the project is to provide at least 200 megawatts of additional generating capacity. Another objective is to improve the efficiency with which hydrocarbons are used by Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in power production  it said. One effect of this would be reduced atmospheric pollution."

"2","Countries meeting at theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) this week are looking at a variety of new ways to resolve the problem of third world debt  Swiss National Bank president Pierre Languetin said. Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMF Interim Committee today reached a consensus that a rescheduling like that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. The Mexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved six months after it started. Various members suggested other options to break the deadlock between debtor countries and their creditors  he said. Languetin said no recommendations were agreed  but he listed some of the suggestions. One involved individual banking systems each resolving the problem of small banks which refused to participate in reschedulings. It was this problem that had prevented completion of the Mexican rescheduling  he said. Debt-equity swaps could be expanded  as could 'on-lending'  which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending' allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts. Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might be forced to sign  exit bonds   prohibiting them from lending to that country again  he said. Languetin said none of these represented a general view. But he added  People are trying to get out of the corset."
"2","A committee of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank said protectionist agricultural policies of industrial countries were a major cause of depressed global commodity prices. The joint Development Committee  in a communique released following day-long discussions  said an improved environment for commodities was extremely important to the long-term viability of developing countries. The committee also criticised the slow-down in lending to debtor nations. Poorer countries  which rely primarily on raw commodity sales to industrial nations to pay their debts  have been highly critical of protectionist agricultural policies in the United States  Western Europe and Japan.  Ministers identified protectionist agricultural policies as a major cause of distortions including depressed commodity prices on world markets  of surplus production and of budgetary drain   the communique said. The communique  delayed because of disputes over specific language  was the final statement by the IMF and the bank after week-long semi-annual meetings of the two lending agencies. Earlier  the IMF's powerful Interim Committee added its voice to growing criticism of delays by commercial banks on critically needed loan packages for debt-laden developing countries. The committee said it welcomed the exploration of new procedures and financing techniques that will help mobilise new financial support for indebted countries. On Thursday  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  in a statement to the policy-making committee  said commercial bank lending to debtor nations last year was disappointing and more flexibility in loan programs was needed.  Doubts about financing can clearly undermine the resolve to carry out needed reforms   Baker said. The Development Committee also joined in the criticism  noting that there had been a declining flow of capital to the developing countries that  has been particularly significant in the case of flows from commercial banks.  A number of bank negotiations are bogged down over details including financial packages for Mexico  Nigeria and Argentina. The banks  acknowledging it has been difficult to complete deals  say part of the blame goes to the developing countries for not making sufficient reform to make them good credit risks."
"2","A British minister said he had given theJapanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets  and it was clearly understood.  Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be  fair and open  about access to their own markets. At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed.  I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government  and I delivered it very clearly  and it has been clearly understood.  Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain.  It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business  while allowing them to carry out other kinds.   I hope we don't have to use these powers  but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met  we shall use them.  He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange  adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.  I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue  it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets.  On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>  which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan  Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case. He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday  he said. Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan  but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners. Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened."
"2","Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports  but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness  or at least the ability  of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However  they said an all-out trade war may be far off  as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs  which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT  would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March  up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986  Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs  up 4.5 pct from 1985  while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris  trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However  British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast  West Germany  with the EC's most successful economy  has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions  preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years  substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present  it is  for instance  pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits  to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport  and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits  but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress  however  that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam  they point out."
"2","A major animal feed producer  CehaveNV Veghel (CHV)  has begun legal proceedings against the application of the European Community grain co-responsibility levy  with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed trade association  Het Comite  association chief executive Peter Pex told Reuters. Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks.  However  that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg   Pex added. Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain.  We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board  the levy collection agency  has interpreted the levy regulations correctly  but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law   Pex said.  It is only with great regret that we have taken this route  but we have had no political help  and therefore have no option even though it could take years   Pex added. Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a legal challenge to the levy  Pex noted. Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case brought by the Association of European Animal Feed Manufacturers  FEFAC."
"2","Sri Lanka's cabinet has ordered a 12pct cut in budget spending by ministries this year to offset the rising cost of the fight against Tamil guerrillas  Finance Ministry officials said. A senior economist at the Ministry  who declined to be named  told Reuters the cuts would not apply to defence-related Ministries and those involved in health and education. Defence expenditure  projected at 10 billion rupees this year  is now forecast at 12 billion and is expected to exceed this by the year-end. The economist said the cuts were part of a government plan to reduce spending to satisfy the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has promised to lend Sri Lanka 6.5 billion rupees to help its balance of payments. The IMF has said previously Sri Lanaka must reduce its budget and balance of payments deficits to satisfy loan conditions. He said World Bank and IMF teams were expected here next month.  If approved the loan would be available only after November and would be part of the 1988 budget   he said."
"2","The European Community (EC) haseffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures  EC diplomats said. They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides. The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body  GATT  unless there are  adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.  Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties  or quantitative limits  on Japanese exports. The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action. They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical  photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe in the wake of possible U.S. Tariff moves. In May  the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc  which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods. Meanwhile  Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily  registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March."

"2","Japan warned the United States it maytake retaliatory measures if the U.S. imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17  a senior government official said at the weekend. Shinji Fukukawa  Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry  said in a statement that Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week. However  Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington on Friday. In March President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honor a July 1986 pact to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the U.S. and to open its home market to U.S. goods. Fukukawa said the U.S. had not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact. He saod the U.S had not given detailed reasons of why it planned tariffs."
"2","Japanese trade figures are seriouslychallenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems. Senior Japanese  U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data  for if currencies are the key they ask  why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan shrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them  fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of world trade recession? U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York. The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan. The officials  most of them economists  can offer no objective reason why they are not. Worse  how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen.? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower. So worst of all  what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation  officials can only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.  I don't know and I don't think anyone knows   said Hugh Richardson  acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.  What I do know is that Community exporters are making a hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort  there is money to be made in Japan   he added. But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S. Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade practices  protected Japanese trade sectors  such as agriculture  and non-tariff barriers  such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports. Publicly  Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private  they blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.  We see it that way  but we don't like to seem arrogant   said a senior official  who declined to be named.  We like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.  Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito  chairman of the Keidanren business group  and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand Japan's markets  and some foreigners agree.  The real issue is the inability of major sectors of American and European industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets   Peter Huggler  President of Interallianz Bank Zurich  told a recent conference in Switzerland.

"2","Turkey is to apply tomorrow for EuropeanCommunity membership  Foreign Ministry officials said.

"2","Portugal's economy  which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest government crisis  analysts said. But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community  which it joined in January last year  they said. Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party  PSD  was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties. The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office. In 1986  Portugal's economy grew four pct  its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct  from 20 pct in 1985. Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.  The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation   said Fritz Haser  economics professor at Universidade Livre  Lisbon.  The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet   economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters. Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress. The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution. Portugal's developing stock markets  however  remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts. Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast  released on the day the PSD government fell  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year. But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development. Soares  who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month  can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament. Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution.  There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections   Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said. He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year. The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution  but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority. A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms  such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry  the analysts said. Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms. The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports  than of PSD policies."

"2","Borrowing on the international capitalmarkets contracted significantly in March with 23.1 billion dlrs of medium and long-term funds raised  down 3.4 billion from February and about nine billion dlrs less than in March 1986  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest monthly report. Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 19.7 billion dlrs  some 1.1 billion below the February figure. The market for floating rate notes saw further setbacks and the volume of new offerings fell to only 800 mln dlrs from 1.4 billion in February. For the first quarter as a whole  the OECD said  funds raised on the floating rate bond market totalled three billion dlrs  the lowest figure since the third quarter of 1982. Activity on the straight bond market was also less buoyant than in previous months while equity-related offerings continued to benefit from the good performance of major stock markets. Exchange rate uncertainties continued to have a major impact on the currency composition of new bonds. Dollar issues totalled 6.8 billion dlrs  accounting for only 35 pct of total offerings  but borrowing was particularly heavy on the euroyen market (3.3 billion dlrs) and in sterling (2.8 billion dlrs). Offerings of mark bonds declined to 1.3 billion dlrs from around three billion dlrs in the two previous months  whilst strong advances were recorded in the euro-Australian and euro-Canadian dollar sectors  where new offerings exceeded one billion dlrs  the OECD said. In the syndicated credit market  the volume of new loans fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in March from 4.2 billion in February. Similarly  activity on the market for note issuance and other back-up facilities fell to one billion dlrs from 1.5 billion. In March  OECD borrowers accounted for over 90 pct of total borrowing. Japan was the largest fund-raiser with 4.5 billion dlrs  followed by the U.S. With 3.9 billion and Britain with 2.4 billion dlrs. France  West Germany and Norway raised funds of over one billion dlrs each. Borrowing by developing countries totalled one billion dlrs  about the same amount as in February. But borrowing by east European countries fell to 300 mln dlrs from 600 mln in February  the OECD added."

"2","World Bank President Barber Conablesaid he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt because the proposal  if adopted  would lead to a cutoff in lending to the indebted countries.  I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create an environment in which no more money will go into development and a lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and to instability indefinitely   he told ABC Television on Sunday. A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion of the debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.  I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuous improvement in policies  of wise use of money in short  rather than trying to turn everybody off   Conable said. Conable told ABC's  Business World  he supported Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt plan as an  andidote to debt.

Brodersohn said that since there  has been progress. I'd say that we are now working on the fine print of the agreement.  Negotiations between Argentina and the banks have been stuck over differences on the question of capitalisation of the debt as well as on-lending programs.

"2","U.S. officials said they held outlittle hope the European Community  EC  would withdraw a controversial meat inspection requirement  due to go into effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut off their exports. But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S. plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S. Agriculture Department. The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC inspection standards beginning April 30. The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule. At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln dlrs in 1985. The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes in their inspection methods  ranging from veterinary staffing to use of wood. Last December  the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle  one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved without further review. USDA would have to certify that the plants had corrected the deficiencies. All remaining plants with a history or potential of shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before further EC review. Robert Hibbert  general counsel for the American Meat Institute  said the meat industry expected to submit a formal trade retaliation petition by April 30. An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft petition. An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule  but that  the chances of that are not too good at this time.  However  there is the  expectation  in U.S. government and meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow shipments  at least through the end of the calendar year  from U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring their operations into conformity with the EC regulation  the USTR official said."

The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure Opec over contract prices  similar to the struggle last March   it said  apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.  More than one official has warned Opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May   it said  noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer."
"2","A senior Abu Dhabi oil official saidin remarks published today the emirate  largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)  was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords. Khalaf al-Oteiba  Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC)  told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.  The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production   he said.  The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market   he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year  when world oil prices dropped  was ADNOC's most difficult ever but  a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.  He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609 000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes  of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985  ADNOC marketed a total of 476 000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products."
"2","Sri Lanka and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) have reached agreement on the broad outline of economic reforms  but tough negotiations are likely before the IMF approves up to 240 mln dlrs in loans  a senior finance ministry official told Reuters. He said the government and IMF this week agreed on a package to reduce the balance of payments deficit  improve management of public enterprises  reform tariffs  develop non-traditional exports and privatise public firms. An IMF-World Bank team will visit Colombo next month to start negotiations on details of a three-year economic reform programme.  There is a broad agreement on the content of the policy package for a structural reform   the official said.  But in areas where the reform would take place  there would be tough neotiations on how much you do and in what order should it take place   he added. Sri Lanka is seeking a total of about 240 mln dlrs in structural adjustment loans to support the balance of payments and in a compensatory financing facility to offset losses in commodity exports. Sri Lanka needs the IMF and World Bank approval of the two facilities to clear the way for negotiations on requests for aid and loans from donor countries. These include an expected pledge of 550 mln dlrs from from 12 industrialised countries and about 240 mln dlrs in loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel said in an interview published today by the Daily News that there was likelihood of Sri Lanka obtaining all of that aid despite intense lobbying by pro-Tamil and human rights groups abroad. He said that although friendly countries were still prepared to assist Sri Lanka with concessional aid  Colombo would have to surmount many problems in detailed negotiations due in May  June and August before these loans are finalised.  In these matters  there's many a slip between the cup and the lip as other governments have learned to their cost   De Mel said."
"2","Consumer prices in the countries of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year  the OECD said in a communique. The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986. Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct  less than January's 1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier  it said. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in February  in line with previous months  although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain. Among the leading seven industrial countries  consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct  followed by Canada at 4.0 pct  Britain at 3.9 pct  France at 3.4 pct  the U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively."
"2","President Reagan today is toannounce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade. The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara  where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement  Reagan said  I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.  He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:   we do not want a trade war  but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.  Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation  saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and  in any case  that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact  but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials  however  have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs  it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States."
"2","The Asian Development Bank (ADB) willnot change its decision to admit China as a member despite protests from founder member Taiwan  bank president Masao Fujioka said. China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the bank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei  China' caused a Taiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila. Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been invited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in Osaka   but the situation remains the same.   The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei  China'   Fujioka said.  We have tried to maintain our channels of communication through the Taiwanese director  but we are not negotiating with a view to changing our agreement with China   he said. ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among the bank's developing members  with 7.2 pct of its equity. Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam  which complained at last year's meeting that for several years the ADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans. An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was made to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974. Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan were disbursed. The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for Vietnam  eight had been closed  two were suspended and only one was under administration at the end of 1986. Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986 totalled 25.3 mln dlrs  or 99.5 pct of the total amount of effective loans  the report said.  The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank operations   Fujioka said.  Vietnam continues to be a member. We would like to help it  but new loans seem to be difficult.   It's not a question of political instability  the environment has to be right for banking operations.  He said with the first loans made to India in 1986  and lending operations in China scheduled to start this year  the ADB had now acquired a  truly Asian  character. Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of experience in borrowing from the World Bank  ADB loans would be routed through the country's central bank  Fujioka said.  It's been a very slow start   Fujioka said.  We identified three projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only two left.  He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln dlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project. He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India. The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250 mln dlrs.  There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should be modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender   Fujioka said. He did not give details. Fujioka said the ADB saw its lending to the private sector serving as a catalyst. The bank's new private sector division in 1986 approved three loans totalling 11.46 mln dlrs without government guarantees. In addition  the ADB approved four equity investment projects totalling 8.15 mln dlrs. This raised to 15.18 mln the cumulative approvals since equity financing commenced in 1983. But Fujioka said the ADB should not compete with private banks.  We have a narrow path to walk   he said. He said he was happy with the decision of the bank's donor countries to increase the ADB's fund for soft loans. The fourth replenishment of the soft-loan window  the Asian Development Fund   brought it to 3.6 billion dlrs  from 3.2 billion  Fujioka said. In particular the United States has maintained its 16 pct share   said the ADB chief. He said there had been disagreements with the U.S.  Which holds 14.9 pct of the bank's equity  over lending policies. The U.S. Complained in 1986 the ADB was granting bad loans in its impatience to hit lending targets.  I suspect there is some arm-twisting   he said.  I find some developed countries are more interested in the procurement side instead of the development side.  Fujioka said he said he foresaw increased sectoral lending and a gradual dilution of the ADB's project-tied lending. Fujioka said project lending was expected to drop to 63 pct of total loans in 1987  from 66.5 pct in 1986 and 77.5 pct in 1985. He said sectoral lending was projected to rise to 20 pct in 1987  from 12.8 pct in 1986 and 7.5 pct in 1985. He said the bank would try to reduce some of its liquid assets by repaying borrowings carrying high interest rates.  On the other hand we must maintain our presence in major financial markets   he said.  Why should we not take advantage of historically low interest rates?"
"2","Asian countries are offering better oilexploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to last year's oil price slump  the United Nations said. The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price fall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms  which found it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region. Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8 billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated to have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled in Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985. The report said &lt;Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co Ltd>  a unit of the &lt;Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30 pct cut in exploration and production spending last year. To counter declining output  India and Malaysia reduced petroleum sharing demands  while Indonesia cut taxes. Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct to cover exploration costs  while Thailand began decreasing its 12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional exporters such as Indonesia  Brunei  China  Malaysia and Iran. Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in 1986 from 40 billion the previous year. Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986 from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985  the U.N. Report said. Iran also lost about six billion dlrs  Brunei 3.8 billion  China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion. However  Asian importers saved between eight and nine billion dlrs during 1985 and 1986  which considerably eased their balance of payments. South Korea  the Philippines  India  Thailand and Pakistan were major beneficiaries  with Thailand and Pakistan respectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year."
"2","Japan's policy of self-sufficiency inrice is an example of extreme protectionism  visiting U.S. Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference. He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan had a large export balance  not just with the U.S. But with other countries  it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product. Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture minister Mutsuki Kato  Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan. Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.  We want to have some access in the rice market   he said. He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He told reporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan on rice. Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency. Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue  Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Rice industry would do. Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or August this year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by the U.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in the meantime. U.S. Rice industry officials have indicated they would consider filing another complaint against the Japan rice import ban."
"2","South Korea has cut loans to exportingcompanies to help reduce the growing trade surplus with the United States and the European Community  finance ministry officials said. They said two billion dlrs worth of foreign currency loans would be available to firms willing to import industrial facilities  and 500 mln dlrs for those importing raw and intermediary materials and parts. Exporters  who previously received 645 won (0.769 dlrs) for each dollar's worth of overseas orders  will now get only 575 won (0.686 dlrs)  they said. The officials said the government also stopped new bank loans given to aid the installation of export-oriented facilities by the nation's 30 largest business groups. A finance ministry official told Reuters the measures were part of the South Korean government's package to curb the increase in the nation's trade surpluses with major trading partners. South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.2 billion dlrs with the United States in 1986  against 4.1 billion in 1985. It had a surplus of 1.09 billion dlrs last year with the EC  against 188.8 mln dlrs in 1985."
"2","The World Bank has suggested Indiashould move to a more open economy by gradually removing most government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external trade policy with reduced levels of protection. A confidential  executive summary  of a draft Bank report on the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of Indian goods by making them more competitive. The summary said   These reforms would result in (domestic) prices much more in line with world prices than is true today  and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen.  The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports.  The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers   the summary said. An Indian official told Reuters the government was discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some changes was likely to be ready by May  but he declined to give further details. The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June. The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87  which ended in March. It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by national savings  mainly from the private sector. India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March  from a record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86. But the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil  petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of India's import bill. India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products  the summary said. The Bank's summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position. It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87  Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs. Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments  the summary said. It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued. India  might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs   it said.  An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability   the summary said. It said such an approach had been successful in countries such as South Korea  Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce import pressures. Earlier this year  the Indian government denied that the World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost exports."

The IFC is interested in a 500 mln ringgit Sabah state government pulp and paper project and is talking to state investment holding company Permodalan Nasional Bhd about joint ventures to help transfer profitable firms to Malays. Ryrie added the IFC is involved in underwriting a 60 mln dlr Malaysian Fund to be launched on the New York Stock Exchange next month.

"2","British Foreign Secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe called on industrial and developing countries to combat trade protectionism and remove barriers which impede free trading in agricultural products. Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30 pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services. Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets  remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide protection for intellectual property rights. He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable currency relationships. Howe said the agricultural industry  plagued by surpluses and falling commodity prices in recent years  is over subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend of growing farm subsidies.  This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to find solutions   Howe said."

"2","Ecuador will use a new pipeline linkwith Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years  Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said. The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline  Once that pipeline is repaired  Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake  Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September.  The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years  with possibility of an extension. Between 20 000 and 50 000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it   Perry said. Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years  at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link  with a maximum capacity of 50 000 bpd  will run from Lago Agrio  the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields  to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was  insignificant compared with what we are going to earn.  OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250 000 bpd before the quake.

"2","The European Community is to offerArgentina compensation for its loss of maize and sorghum exports to Spain following Spain's accession to the EC  EC sources said. They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva  headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  and will also involve products other than cereals. They gave no further details. Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero last year from 300 000 tonnes in 1985  while maize sales fell to 15 000 tonnes from 994 000  official EC statistics show. The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and the U.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum each year for the next four years. But they said various details of this accord will tend to inhibit imports from Argentina. These include a provision for reduction of the amounts if Spain imports cereals substitutes  and the EC's plan to import the special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis. Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three or four times a year."

He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government was holding back on authorisation to hold prices low.  They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet this year's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on what looks like a bigger harvest than we expected   he said. He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate had caused a price drop  with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetas a kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing year ending July 31. Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370 000 tonnes this year from 340 000 last year  with seed output up at 905 000 tonnes from 860 000 last year. He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports of other edible oils.  We estimate demand at 296 000 tonnes this year  leaving a 124 000 tonne surplus with the 50 000 tonnes now stockpiled   he said.  If we discount 24 000 tonnes held for strategic purposes  this still leaves us with 100 000 tonnes."

He told African planning and economy ministers that the questionnaires  distributed by the Economic Commission to monitor the programmes  showed that 25 of the 31 countries had taken steps to increase foreign aid. The same number had improved the investment climate in their countries  he said. Twenty-two had made structural adjustments to their economies  22 had taken measures to promote exports and five had carried out an  overall economic rehabilitation   he added. The main thrust of the recovery programmes was to encourage agriculture by giving farmers greater incentives to produce. The OAU plan envisaged investment of 128 billion dlrs in all 50 African countries over the next five years. Foreign donors were expected to contribute 46 billion dlrs. Nineteen out of 50 African governments have failed to answer the questionnaire  he said."
"2","The most likely reason for West Germanproducers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores is that they already have  or are reasonably certain of  obtaining European Community (EC) export licences for it  traders said. They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels saying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79 250 tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1. The traders said it is also likely that French producers  who put over 700 000 tonnes into intervention  will withdraw a significant proportion of this for the same reason before they are due to accept payment for the sugar in early May. Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level of export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders  with generous subsidies  had been due to producer threats to leave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of the old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May. The EC has so far granted licences for 2 467 970 tonnes out of around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87 series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of high tonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and subsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids for the export licences  traders said."
"2","High labour costs and slower corporateinvestment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said. The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than in previous years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with 2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on external factors  particularly lower oil prices  the OECD secretariat said in its latest annual report on Sweden. It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in Sweden than in other OECD countries. Because of high labour costs Swedish industry  which largely relies upon export markets  was losing market share. Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986  in line with 1985 increases  while public sector wages rose an estimated 9.2 pct in 1986  up from six pct in 1985. This was significantly higher than average wage increases of 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986. The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining economic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiations should be at least partly centralised to control the total wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels. Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscal policy  inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 from almost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most other OECD countries  the report said. Unemployment  a principal policy target  was at 2.7 pct in 1986  in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECD average of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employment policies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation. It also said that economic growth in 1986 relied increasingly on private consumption because corporate investment in machinery and equipment had shrunk. The total volume of industrial investments dropped by two pct in 1986  with sharp declines in spending by the wood  pulp and paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985 when there was heavy investment in these industries. The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boost corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic consumption for economic growth. It suggested there was room for reform in the tax system. Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending  especially in local government  to keep in line with its tighter fiscal policy  the report said."
"2","Japan s 1987 car exportrestraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough  EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq said. There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are diverting cars to the EC after the dollar s fall against the yen made their U.S. Market unprofitable  he told reporters after meeting U.S.  Japanese  and Canadian trade ministers. The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to currency movements over the past two years  it will move to prevent it  he said. Over the period  the yen has risen against the dollar almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency Unit  he said. Japan has set an unofficial  voluntary 10 pct rise in car exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its rising trade surplus with the Community  which hit a record 18 billion dlrs last year. But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales  and a seven per cent fall globally.  We think there is some diversion there   said de Clercq. Japanese officials say the overall annual rise will be only 10 pct.  But even 10 pct is 100 000 cars  whereas we sell only 40 000 cars to Japan (per year) in total   he said. The EC is also demanding that Japan ease its strict checks and requirements for imported cars  which Brussels says is a non-tariff barrier. The EC is also worried because EC demand for cars is falling this year  making any rise in Japanese imports even more serious for EC auto manufacturers. De Clercq  who has taken a hard line on world trade problems at this weekend meeting in central Japan  said the EC appreciated Japan s plans to cut exports and lift domestic growth instead.  But even if all these measures are implemented  it will take time. But there is not time   he said.  There are burning issues on the table which cannot wait. It were better that the fire were put out immediately and not to wait till the house burns down   he said."
"2","United Arab Emirates (UAE) CentralBank Governor Abdel Malik al-Hamar said any changes in the UAE s exchange rate policy would be carried out in conjunction with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. In a speech opening a seminar on Arab exchange rate policies  he noted the UAE had not changed the value of the dirham against the U.S. Dollar since 1980 despite wide fluctuations in the latter s value against other currencies.  The exchange rate policy of the dirham has realised its goals in the past and changes in this policy depend on coordination and cooperation with other GCC countries   he said. The GCC states -- the UAE  Saudi Arabia  Bahrain  Qatar  Oman and Kuwait -- have agreed in principle to link their currencies to a common grid. Their currencies are now linked either to the dollar  IMF special drawing right (SDR) or  in the case of Kuwait  a trade-weighted basket of international currencies. The UAE dirham can fluctuate within a band of 7.25 pct higher or lower than 4.7619 to the SDR but has been fixed at 3.671 to the dollar since November 1980."
"2","The World Bank  citing Pakistan s progressin its economic performance and fiscal policy reforms  said it had agreed a 2.4 billion dlr aid programme for 1988. The bank said in a statement  substantial increases  had been approved to help fund support for refugees from neighbouring Afghanistan. But the bank said it had expressed serious concern at Pakistan s budget.  This year s overall budget deficit is expected to be larger than either either last year s outcome or the amount originally budgeted (for 1987)   it added."
"2","Ministers from the majortrading nations have for the first time made a concerted commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world farm trade  Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said.  We think we can get some movement on this   she told reporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S.  Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here. Canada  strongly supported by Australia  has championed the cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war between the United States and the EC. Japan s protected agricultural markets have also attracted criticism. The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted  developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farm sector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot compete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.  Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so)  but many countries cannot   said Carney. She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which to discuss the issue. Talks will now continue at the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  which meets next month  and at the series of discussions on a new world trading framework  begun at Punta del Este  Uruguay  last year. Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role in the farm talks  and that the United States was willing to see short-term progress  as long as long-term solutions were not affected. Canada s five point programme demands that farm product prices must reflect open world market prices  that any support for farmers incomes should not be linked to production incentives  that there should be no new farm subsidies  no new farm import barriers  and that any decisions should be implemented collectively. The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers. The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have created some absurd situations. For example  to protect its farmers the Japanese government buys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price to Japanese consumers.  So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market to help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a profit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their farmers   said Carney. The problem causes pain for many nations and increases the already dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S.  Japanese and EC banks."
"2","Bank profits in the Gulf oil state ofQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are retrenching further in one of the region s most overbanked markets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for several foreign banks  although locally-owned operations were in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market share. &lt;Qatar National Bank SAQ> s (QNB) General Manager  Abdulla Khalid al-Attiya  said:  The economy is not improving as we hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks.  Oil-dependent Qatar  with a tiny indigenous population of 60 000 to 80 000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about 280 000  boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank operations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide recession  aggravated this year by Qatar s severe difficulty marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices  has taken a heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result  the only U.S. Bank  &lt;Citibank NA>  is thought to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing locally based &lt;Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started operations in 1984  bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched  with &lt;Standard Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow. &lt;Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit 51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local business  bankers said. One banker added:  Weak profits are here to stay for the time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment.  Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to fixed prices. However  it soon became apparent that Qatar was having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been running in recent weeks at 100 000 and 120 000 barrels per day  well down on the nation s OPEC quota of 285 000  oil sources said. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar s revenue has led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to private contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits last year  as did the introduction of minimum reserve requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks  QNB conducts the bulk of the government s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage its rivals cannot expect to match  bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1 mln Qatari riyals  while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to 9.0 billion  making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging loans for the public and private sector to tide government departments and local business over the lean economic spell  Attiya said.  Generally speaking  we are overbanked in Qatar   he said  echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest  &lt;Doha Bank Ltd QSC>  reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to 27.5 mln riyals  while &lt;Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>  registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank  continued to expand rapidly and reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the start-up period from August 4  1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks  increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to reexamine their staffing levels and overheads. &lt;Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit in 1985 of 12 000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf  the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered  also found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in 1985  but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985 s result had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.  Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline  while local banks are increasing their market share   Farquharson said. BBME s operating profit was steady in 1986  edging up to 12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985.  We are expecting the same level of operating profit in 1987   Farquharson said. Standard Chartered s net profit last year recovered slightly to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161 000 in 1985. Staff numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore."
"2","Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action.  Until today we have anounced policies  but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody   Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.  From now on  if a government comes up with a certain policy  it must be followed by action   he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States  the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week  the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen  despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade.  We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence  then we can have an impact   said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general  it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets.  The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club  you have to act in concord with the rules  if you want to be credible   said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed:  We are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face.  She said that next month s meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later.  The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued   he said.  What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way   he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others  positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions  he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential  but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year  an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986  and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion  he said. Trade retaliation  protectionism  and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous  he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal  monetary  trade and industrial measures  and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules  he said. In this regard  the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened  he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy."
"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers resume discussions in Luxembourg tomorrow on tough 1987/88 farm price proposals from the bloc s executive Commission with only thin hopes of reaching a quick agreement. Their current chairman  Belgium s Paul de Keersmaeker  promised at the end of the group s last meeting that if agreement appeared in sight this week  he would keep his colleagues at the negotiating table for long days and nights. But one diplomat told journalists:  I don t think you need to worry about that. We are a long way from the crunch yet.  The commission has tabled a series of proposals which farm experts say would together amount to the most swingeing attack on overspending on the bloc s Common Agricultural Policy  and the biggest blow to farmers  incomes  in years. As well as cuts in common farm prices of 2.5 pct in the key cereals sector  quality standards for farm goods sold into EC surplus stores would be raised and the period of the year when such sales were allowed restricted. The experts say prices received by farmers would be cut by over 10 pct for many crops if such measures were agreed. The effects  however  would be mitigated by Commission proposals unveiled on April 14 for generous cash grants to farmers worst hit by the struggle to curb EC food surpluses. When ministers met on March 30 and 31 in Brussels for initial discussions on the farm price package  several  notably France s Francois Guillaume and West Germany s Ignaz Kiechle  said the proposals were unacceptably tough. Only the Dutch and British delegations gave general support to the Commission line that such drastic measures were necessary to curb surplus food production in the EC and to reduce the massive cost of the CAP. But even then  the British are among several delegations which oppose the Commission s controversial plan to raise two billion European Currency Units through a tax on imported and EC-produced oilseeds and fats. In order to seek common ground  de Keersmaeker plans to spend the whole of tomorrow in bilateral meetings with each of his colleagues in turn. Diplomats said although the ministers will meet together on Tuesday  de Keersmaeker is likely to conclude that further talks at the level of officials are necessary and that the hard bargaining will have to wait until May."
"2","Plans for a new-style EuropeanCommunity (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive their first full review from EC foreign ministers today  but are unlikely to gather much support. Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget payments by bringing member states  contributions more into line with national wealth. They said the EC s current paymasters  Britain  France  and West Germany  would lead the opposition to the plans  designed to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s. Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five billion dlrs  EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system. Such action was necessary  he argued  to end a damaging cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological research programs and regional and social spending projects. Ironically  diplomats said  the move could spark exactly the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members. Delors  plans  by linking a country s contributions to its Gross National Product (GNP)  would over the next five years add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion. Currently  contributions are calculated on a percentage of Value Added Tax (VAT) returns. Under the new scheme  all countries would pay one pct of their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a country s total VAT receipts and its GNP. London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to the scheme  arguing instead that money should be made available from deep cutbacks in the EC s heavily-subsidised farm sector. Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the wearisome budget wrangling  taking the line that the highly diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when forced to do so. The issue is further complicated by a possible general election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of the way."
"2","Delegates from 46 countries aregathering for the 20th meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) amid concern over the bank s role in aiding regional development. The three-day meeting  the first to be held in Japan since the bank s inaugural meeting in Tokyo in 1966  will open tomorrow with political controversy dogging its heels. Taiwan  one of the ADB s founders  will boycott the meeting for the second year in succession in protest against China s admission last year. Taiwan  which borrowed only 100 mln dlrs or 0.51 pct of the ADB s total lending of 19.4 billion dlrs over the past 20 years  is staying away because its name was changed by the bank to  Taipei  China.  But the boycott is likely to be overshadowed by the presence of communist giants China and the Soviet Union. Moscow is attending an ADB meeting for the first time in what is widely seen as a first step to eventual full membership. China is expected to obtain its first loans from the bank in 1987. A senior ADB official said Peking  now the bank s third largest shareholder after the United States and Japan  would also take one of the 12 seats on the bank s board of governors. The official  who declined to be identified  expected sparks to fly when governors met in formal session on Tuesday. He said calls for expanded bank lending were expected from poorer countries in the Asia-Pacific region  hit by plunging commodity prices  tariff barriers in export markets  a growing resources crunch and balance of payments crises. But the U.S. Delegation was likely to repeat warnings ADB lending should stress quality over quantity  the official said. The debate over ADB lending is fuelled by the bank s highly successful money management. With liquid reserves of about four billion dlrs  profits have been rising steadily and touched 287 mln dlrs last year. The key indicator of the ADB s reduced role in regional development is its net transfer of resources -- loan disbursements less repayments made by borrowers -- which fell sharply to 237 mln dlrs in 1986 from 421 mln in 1985. In 1986  the bank approved loans totalling two billion dlrs  but only to 19 of its 29 developing members. ADB chief economist Kedar Nath Kohli told Reuters the bank s ordinary lending had declined each year since 1984.  I m afraid if you exclude India and China  it s going to go down even further in 1987   Kohli said. Kohli said developing countries in the region were entering a period of painful adjustments. He said one country that seemed to be on the right track was South Korea  which had bucked the regional trend of rising indebtedness by cutting its foreign debt by about two billion dlrs last year. One country that has complained about the ADB's lending policies is Vietnam  which charged at last year's meeting that the bank had cut off its aid on political grounds. The bank abruptly halted loans to Hanoi after the fall of the Saigon government in 1975. Despite Moscow's presence  however  the bank is not expected to change its Vietnam policy. The Philippines  the ABD's second-largest borrower in 1986 with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs  is happy with the bank's role. Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters he expected the figure would reach roughly the same level this year."
"2","The Soviet Union is attending anAsian Development Bank (ADB) annual general meeting for the first time  but has not decided whether to apply for membership  a senior Soviet State Bank official said.  No specific plans exist for applying for membership   Yurij Ponomarev  international managing director of the State Bank  told Reuters.  It's too early to draw up any plans.  The USSR is attending the 20th meeting as an observer.  The sole purpose is to observe and collect information first hand   Ponomarev said. He said the Soviet Union was responding to a long-standing ADB invitation to attend the meetings.  This is one of the fastest growing regions in the world   the State Bank official said.  It is in our interest to have good contacts.  But those strengthened contacts will not be made at the expense of the Soviet Union's other relationships  he said. Delegates here said the USSR move was connected to recent efforts to develop closer ties with Asia. The policy was announced last year by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in a speech at Vladivostok. Moscow's decision to attend the meetings follows its application last year for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Delegates said the USSR faces lacklustre growth and is searching for ways to boost its economy. Although the ADB said political ideology is not a critiera for membership  several delegates said politics would play a large role in any decision to allow Moscow to join. Moscow's application would have to be approved by two-thirds of the board of governors representing three-quarters of the total voting power of member countries. The basic votes of the 47 members are all equal and total one-fifth of all votes. The remainder are proportional to the number of shares held by each member. Japan is the largest shareholder  at 15.1 pct  followed by the U.S. With 14.9 pct and China with 7.2 pct. The U.S. Has more than 12 pct of the total votes  insufficient to block a Moscow membership bid. Japanese officials said Tokyo has not decided its position regarding the possibility of Soviet membership and said they noted the Soviets had not yet made any move to join."
"2","The Philippines has received a 300mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank  Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters. Ongpin said the loan  carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year  matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the World Bank in March. Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed. Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and 80 billion yen. The aid package  originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87 fiscal year ended March  was delayed because of the Philippines' change of government last year.  The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49 billion yen   he said.  But they are likely to bring it up to that level for the 15th package.  Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the 14th yen package.  We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of untied commodity loans   he said. Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft loans to finance a land reform program  for which Japan is expected to supply most of the financing  had been put off until next month because of delays in preparatory work. Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here. Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed leader Ferdinand Marcos.  But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the field of lending to the private sector   he said. The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower after Pakistan in 1986  with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs. Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in 1987 to reach the same level.  They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we want. But we have to come up with the projects   he said."
"2","Egypt is trying to persuade Arab statesand banks to buy its military debts to the United States and other Western countries so it can repay them on better terms  an Egyptian official said.  We want the Arabs to buy the debt and reschedule it at a more reasonable interest rate of up to seven pct   the official  who asked not to be named  told Reuters. Egypt owes the U.S. 4.5 billion dlrs in military debt and has failed to persuade Washington to reduce interest rates on it averaging about 14 pct. Eqypt also owes France an undisclosed amount  estimated by Arab diplomats at over two billion dlrs  and has not serviced the debt for over a year. Other military debts are owed to Spain  West Germany and Britain. The official said negotiations on the possibility of buying the debt have started  with approaches made to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia  but no firm decisions have been reached. The official also said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Egypt have agreed on certain economic reforms in return for emergency funds. An accord with the IMF would open the way for Cairo to reschedule its 40 billion dlr debt. The official said the IMF agreement requires Egypt to raise energy prices to international levels  unify its multi-tiered foreign exchange system and raise interest rates.  Egypt will seek loans from various countries immediately after the agreement with the IMF is signed   he said.  If an Arab country buys part of the military debt or gives us guarantees  it will encourage banks to step in   he added."
"2","India  which received its firstloans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986  expects to increase borrowing this year  an Indian official said. The official  a member of the Indian delegation at the ADB's annual meeting here  told Reuters the bank is likely to approve three loans totalling between 350 and 400 mln dlrs in 1987  up from the 250 mln in two loans in 1986. The official said negotiations on a 100 mln dlr loan for the modernisation of the Haldia and Madras ports had been completed and only need approval by the bank's board. The official said an ADB team is now in India for a survey of the second project involving imports of railway locomotives. He said the bank was also likely to extend a credit line to the Industrial Development Bank of India. The ADB in 1986 extended a 100 mln dlr line of credit to state-owned Industrial Finance Corp of India. The official said the ADB wants to gradually expand lending to India.  They (the bank) do not want their traditional borrowers from smaller countries in the region to get overwhelmed by (India and China)   he said. China is expected to receive its first ADB loan this year.  We are quite satisfied at having opened this new window in borrowing   the official said.  Our projects are being vetted quickly. We have no complaints.  He said the ADB in any case would not be able to match Indian borrowing needs.  In fiscal 1986/87 ending June India will borrow two billion dlrs from the World Bank alone   he said.  That represents the total ADB lending to all its borrowers in 1986.  The official said total Indian development assistance from multilateral and bilateral creditors is likely to total four billion dlrs in 1986/87. Asked to comment on U.S. Criticism of the quality of ADB lending  the official said:  The ADB is a regional bank and ought to have a better understanding of realities in Asia.   You cannot apply World Bank conditionalities everywhere   he said.  The U.S. Cannot impose one yardstick for every country."
"2","Taiwan accused China of trying todowngrade its international status by forcing the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to change its name in the organisation. Taiwan is boycotting the annual meeting of the ADB  which opened in Tokyo today  in protest at the Bank's decision to change its name to  Taipei  China  from  Republic of China  after admitting China as a member.  It is a plot by China to downgrade Taiwan's status in the organisation   Foreign Ministry spokesman Cheyne Chiu told a news conference."
"2","The resignation of Finance MinisterDilson Funaro is bound to focus attention on whether Brazil will now adopt a more flexible debt stance and move towards an accord with creditors  bankers and political analysts said. With Funaro in charge  Brazil's relations with creditors sank to a low ebb  they said. Bankers told anti-Funaro jokes from Sao Paulo to New York and economic analysts said the personal animosity between the minister and U.S. Bankers was a real obstacle to reaching agreement on rescheduling Brazil's 111 billion dlr debt. Commenting on Funaro  a foreign banker here recently told Reuters   They (banks) see his removal pretty much as a precondition for getting serious negotiations under way.  Funaro angered the banks in February by suspending interest payment on Brazil's 68 billion dlr bank debt. There was also a question of personal style. Bankers disliked Funaro's aloof demeanor and in private heatedly accused him of arrogance and inflexibility. However  Funaro did not fall because he upset foreign bankers but rather because his Cruzado Plan price freeze last year was a massive flop  economically and politically. However  it is in the domain of the debt and Brazil's relation with creditors that his departure will have the most closely-watched international repercussion  bankers said. It became part of Funaro's trademark that he would have no truck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  thus effectively blocking a debt agreement. He argued that if Brazil sought the help of the IMF  the Fund would lay down conditions which would lead to recession. Funaro and others who supported this position had memories of the IMF austerity program in Brazil in the early 1980s  a period when hungry crowds stormed supermarkets. The foreign banker in Sao Paulo said   I think Brazil could have an agreement with the IMF which would allow (it) acceptable growth.  Argentina  working with the IMF  won excellent terms for a major portion of its 50 billion dlr debt earlier this month. Given the IMF role in the Argentine accord  a U.S. Diplomat here said the agreement had been extremely damaging for Funaro because it showed that cooperation with the IMF bore fruit. Mexico has also taken the IMF path and  earlier than Argentina  clinched a favourable pioneering agreement with creditors on its 100 billion dlr debt. Brazil is now the only one of the three biggest Latin American debtors not to have a debt agreement. Some Brazilian opinion  particularly in the business community  is favourable to an IMF accord. A leading newspaper  Jornal do Brazil  carried a report from Washington over the weekend saying it was a myth the IMF brought recession and the best moment for an accord was now. As it happens  a routine IMF mission is visiting Brasilia. The government has repeatedly dismissed speculation it is considering any major change in debt policy and political analysts caution against expecting changes on the IMF issue. The government of President Jose Sarney has gained a reputation for chronic indecisiveness and some analysts believe the government will turn to the IMF only if it comes to the conclusion there really is no option. But such a policy shift looks more and more likely before too long in the eyes of many analysts. One major political obstacle  Funaro  is no longer in the picture and the economic pressures on Brazil are growing. The sharp drop in the trade surplus  which triggered Brazil's present debt crisis  shows no sign of being reversed. In the first quarter of 1987 Brazil chalked up a surplus of only 526 mln dlrs  just a fraction of the 2.47 billion dlr surplus it had in the same period last year. Brazilian officials concede that time is not on their side in the debt crisis.  Brazil has an interest in resolving this problem as rapidly as possible   Central Bank President Francisco Gros said on Friday."
"2","Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of the year  Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand have been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half of the year  prices will tend to increase  because non-OPEC producers have not been able to produce more oil at current prices  he said. But he declined to predict  when asked after the meeting  whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over the last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day  or two mln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries  particularly the U.S. And Canada  is expected to decrease this year  but some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in Cameroon  India and other developing countries  he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the upper hand in world oil markets  Subroto said in an earlier speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.  If OPEC emerges the winner  than it can gradually resume its former role in world oil markets   he said.  But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30 dlrs a barrel  at least not in the next three or four years   Subroto said."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa opened the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank by holding out the promise of more Japanese money for the organisation.  We are ... Striving to enhance the flow of capital from Japan to the developing countries   he said.  The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern for us in our bilateral and multilateral assistance.  He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a special Japanese fund at the ADB  like the one at the World Bank. The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developing countries. Developing countries and the United States have criticised Japan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poor countries. Later this week  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is expected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend as much as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the next three years  Japanese officials said. The exta ADB funding would be part of that amount.  Our cooperation is intended to contibute to ... Alleviating the burden on (developing countries)   said Miyazawa  who is also chairman of the ADB board of governors.  The developing countries today find themselves in a very difficult situation   he said.  With a few notable exceptions  those countries that are highly dependent upon commodity exports face a rough road ahead.  While the developing countries can help themselves by striving to become internationally competitive and seeking to attract foreign investment  the ADB also has a role to play  he said. Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up its economic advice program to developing nations and must work vigorously to identify development projects for loans. He also called for more use of loans that were not tied to development projects  but provided more overall help to the borrower. ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view.  The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor   Fujioka said.  The bank will now have to equip itself to meet a range of services required to attend to varied needs of its developing members.  Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow its Export-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans. These would not have to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment. Tokyo was also prepared to let the Asian Development Bank raise more funds in Tokyo and financial markets should it need to do so  he said."
"2","The United States and Japan are waging abehind the scenes battle at this week's Asian Development Bank meeting over Tokyo's attempts to win a greater say in the organization  U.S. And Japanese delegates said. Washington is opposing the Japanese efforts because it would mean the end of the long-standing parity between the two nations in the Bank  U.S. Officials said. Right now  the two countries' voting shares are about equal  Japan having 12.53 pct and the United States 12.36 pct. The slight difference is due to a temporary delay in the U.S. Subscription to the Bank.  It's quite a delicate matter   Japanese Finance Ministry deputy director general Fumiya Iwasaki told Reuters.  I don't see the discussion ending soon.  The issue is further complicated because other member nations would have to give up some of their power in the Bank if Japan were to increase its influence  he said. Tokyo raised the issue at last year's annual meeting in Manila  arguing that the 3.7 billion dlrs it has contributed to the Bank's soft loans fund entitled it to a greater say in the overall organization. The United States has given 1.2 billion dlrs to the Asian Development Fund."
"2","The Philippines has received a 300mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank  Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters. Ongpin said the loan  carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year  matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the World Bank in March. Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed. Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and 80 billion yen. The aid package  originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87 fiscal year ended March  was delayed because of the Philippines' change of government last year.  The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49 billion yen   he said.  But they are likely to bring it up to that level for the 15th package.  Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the 14th yen package.  We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of untied commodity loans   he said. Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft loans to finance a land reform program  for which Japan is expected to supply most of the financing  had been put off until next month because of delays in preparatory work. Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here. Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed leader Ferdinand Marcos.  But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the field of lending to the private sector   he said. The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower after Pakistan in 1986  with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs. Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in 1987 to reach the same level.  They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we want. But we have to come up with the projects   he said."
"2","The U.S. warned its majortrade partners that its trade deficit must fall by September or a protectionist trade bill from Congress would be highly likely. Meanwhile  European Community (EC) external trade chief Willy de Clercq said that if Japan's trade surplus  which hit almost 90 billion dlrs last year  continued so high  there would be stormy weather ahead. U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter told trade leaders from Japan  the EC and Canada that there was at least a 50-50 chance that a protectionist bill reaching the House of Representatives this week would pass the Senate in September. The U.S. economy badly needed better trade figures by then  or President Ronald Reagan would have a difficult time vetoing such a bill  he said  according to a series of briefings to reporters by official delegates at the weekend meeting. A 15 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit in March had only incensed Congress further  he said."
"2","Japan's 1987 car exportrestraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough  EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq said. There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are diverting cars to the EC after the dollar's fall against the yen made their U.S. market unprofitable  he told reporters after meeting U.S.  Japanese  and Canadian trade ministers. The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to currency movements over the past two years  it will move to prevent it  he said. Over the period  the yen has risen against the dollar almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency Unit  he said. Japan has set an unofficial  voluntary 10 pct rise in car exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its rising trade surplus with the Community  which hit a record 18 billion dlrs last year. But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales  and a seven per cent fall globally.  We think there is some diversion there   said de Clercq."

"2","Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPECoil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel unless oil demand grows strongly  the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said. The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative Saudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would not change  unless and until there is a strong revival in the growth of demand for oil.  MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources. The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy sources.  Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level   MEES said. The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week  causing the month's average to be below quota  MEES said. MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around 16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for March and Reuter estimates for March. It said Iranian production had risen by 500 000 bpd this month to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd  around its quota level. In Iraq  with an OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd  output rose this month to two mln bpd  not including  war relief  supplies from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia  the newsletter said. Nigeria  which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln bpd entitlement  increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd  it added."

Peking's representatives have been attending board meetings over the past year as observers with no voting rights  he added. He said China  the bank's third-largest shareholder after Japan and the United States  will take the seat on the 12-member board currently occupied by a grouping of Sri Lanka  Vietnam  the Maldives  Laos and Afghanistan. He also said the U.S.  Whose nominee on the board  Joe O. Rogers  resigned in September 1986  has named Victor Frank as his replacement.

"2","Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action.  Until today we have anounced policies  but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody   Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.  From now on  if a government comes up with a certain policy  it must be followed by action   he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States  the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week  the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen  despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade.  We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence  then we can have an impact   said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general  it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets.  The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club  you have to act in concord with the rules  if you want to be credible   said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Pat Carney of Canada said  We are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face.  She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later.  The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued   he said.  What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way   he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others' positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions  he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential  but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year  an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986  and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion  he said. Trade retaliation  protectionism  and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous  he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal  monetary  trade and industrial measures  and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules  he said. In this regard  the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened  he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy."
"2","The Sixth International Tin Agreement ITA  has been extended for two years from July 1  1987  the International Tin Council  ITC  said. The extension was formally agreed at a resumed special session of the council held here this morning and follows a session early this month when the council agreed in principle to extend the pact but had to await the formal approval of some member governments. The extension will enable the council to continue with its statistical work and studies of the tin industry."
"2","French producers have withdrawn alloffers to sell more than 700 000 tonnes of sugar into European Community intervention stocks  EC Commission sources said. They also said West German producers had now withdrawn the last 3 000 of the 79 250 tonnes they sold into EC stores on April 1. The sales were made to protest against the level of export restitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders. Last Friday  commission sources said the West German producers had withdrawn all but 3 000 tonnes of their sales. The protest by European producers involved sales of 854 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention  of which 785 000 tonnes were accepted by the commission. Under EC regulations  operators had five weeks before receiving payment to withdraw the sugar. Their decision to withdraw the sugar follows what commission sources have said is a slight shift in the authority's stance in recent weeks. The commission last week increased the maximum restitutions to within about 0.5 Ecus per kilo of the prices which traders claim are needed to match intervention prices."
"2","European Community foreign ministersagreed to formal talks on signing an economic pact with Hungary  in a move which could clear the way towards establishing EC diplomatic ties with Budapest  EC officials said. They said Community foreign ministers agreed to mandate the EC executive Commission to open talks on a cooperation pact which would boost trade and economic ties with Hungary. Earlier this year  Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Jozsef Marjai said Hungary might be willing to normalise relations with the Community in exchange for such a deal  according to EC officials. No date has been fixed for opening the talks."
"2","A shift in the European Community'sattitude to exports led to West German producers withdrawing sugar sold into intervention  industry sources said. The sources noted the withdrawal followed a rise in maximum Commission restitutions to within 0.5 European currency units  Ecus  per 100 kilos of the level traders claim is needed to match intervention prices. One source said   This was taken as a sign that the Community was taking a more favourable stance towards exports.  He added producers still expected more from the Commission. German producers had sold 79 250 tonnes into intervention."
"2","The sliding value of the U.S. dollarmay soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its oil benchmark price  setting the stage for prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend  top executives with U.S. oil companies said. The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a 15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling. But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar  the currency used by OPEC for its oil sales  is making the 18 dlr price difficult to sustain  said Fred Hartley  chairman of Unocal Corp &lt;UCL>. The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since December and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the past two years. Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil prices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25 dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988.  I think June will be the critical month to see what they do   said Hartley  who was in Houston to attend the World Petroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in June which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions that oil should be priced according to a basket of world currencies instead of the U.S. dollar. E.H. Clark  chairman of &lt;Baker Hughes Inc>  said the Saudi kingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater world demand -- would drive any price increases.  The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of trade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the U.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months ago   Clark said in an interview.  I'm betting on the Saudi king's need to sustain revenues.  Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a barrel by January one. However  the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase OPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth. Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based on the longterm need to restore the competitive position of OPEC oil against other energy sources. Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase in world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next few years. Michel Moreau  a director of the &lt;Elf Aquitaine Group>  said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a consensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were necessary to cover exploration costs  royalties and taxes on new production. The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the cash-strapped nations of Nigeria  Egypt and Gabon refrain from discounting oil prices or increasing production levels  Moreau said.  I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect  the production agreement will fall apart   he said.  But this threat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line. Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986.  Lawrence Rawl  chairman of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>  told Reuters he expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of 1987  adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility. Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of prices  fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the cartel's production agreement.  This is a year of testing   said Alfred Munk  manager of foreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN).  If they fail  there may be a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel.  French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud said   Demand is not going up very quickly  at best maybe one percent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct   Vaillaud said."
"2","European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker  who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings  were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday  they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct  and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores  to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins  and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds  a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers  all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions  maintained entrenched positions yesterday  making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in a notional common currency  are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area  saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which  while not having the status of a compromise proposal  would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle  with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns  and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically  is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for."
"2","A study by the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development says it may take years to resolve the huge economic imbalances now plaguing the world economy  U.S. and western officials said. The paper was expected to stimulate policy debate among senior officials of leading industrial nations preparing for next month's annual meeting of finance ministers in Paris. The May 11-13 ministerial meeting of the 24-nation OECD  a forum for coordinating economic policies  has taken on added significance in view of the difficulties dogging the attempts of major nations to achieve joint goals. Despite two meetings of the seven leading industrial powers -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada -- pledges to change policy have still to be turned into action. As a result  financial markets have been unusually unstable and have focussed their attention on every international meeting for clues that change is in the air. The study concludes that there needs to be much greater fiscal action by the United States  West Germany and Japan to reduce their massive trade imbalances  a U.S. official said.  We looked at what we could do to get from here to there. We've got to continue cutting the deficit  and there needs to be domestic expansion (in West Germany and Japan)   the official said  noting that significant actions are called for. Officials noted the study strongly underscores the need for action by West Germany and Japan. Seperately  western officials said they understood that U.S. overtures to Japan and West Germany to cut their short-term interest rates have been rebuffed for now. Such rate reductions would have helped stabilize the steep decline of the dollar  by widening the difference between bond yields in the United States  on the one hand  and in Japan and West Germany on the other. One official said that while the policy actions called for were similar to those urged by the seven  the study shows  it's going to take several years to resolve (the trade imbalances).  The OECD has set three pct as the necessary target for average annual growth in the industrial world if trade imbalances are to be corrected and the Third World debt crisis kept under control. The study strongly implies these targets will not be met without major action by the three leading nations  officials said. Equally  it suggests that without major fiscal expansion by Bonn and Tokyo  and a corresponding deep reduction in the U.S. budget deficit  the current trend of an upturn in U.S. interest rates and a weakening dollar will go uncorrected. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker says the dollar's deep decline alone will shave only 15 billion dlrs off the roughly 140 billion dlrs U.S. deficit in goods and services this year. But the study group also found that progress has been made and the seven main nations are moving in the right direction. In Paris this February  the seven agreed that fiscal actions by the three major powers would help them stabilize currencies around levels ruling then. The Reagan administration  this week facing the prospect of a tough trade bill aimed at curbing foreign trade surpluses  also promised to fight protectionism. The officials said Washington must move ahead with budget deficit cuts of around 36 billion dlrs  a figure set as a goal by the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives. They also called for significant increases in the budget deficits of Japan and West Germany. Since the study group met  Japan has announced a roughly 35 billion dlr supplementary budget which was warmly welcomed by Washington. Nonetheless there is caution over both the timing and the content of the proposed Japanese budget. Financial markets  unconvinced by yet another Japanese promise of action  have pushed the yen sharply higher against the dollar. While no West German fiscal action is promised before January 1988  U.S. officials would welcome such a move.  We'd love them to accelerate their tax cuts   one official said. West German economic growth fell steeply in the first quarter this year  but the official said Bonn has reassured U.S. officials they expect growth to pick up again. If faster German growth fails to emerge  Bonn could find itself under pressure to speed up tax cuts planned for early 1988 when leaders of the seven meet in Venice this June."
"2","Hong Kong has not taken unfairadvantage of its currency's link with the U.S. Dollar  Hong Kong monetary affairs secretary David Nendick told the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank here. He said:  We have taken the rough with the smooth  having to accept a downward adjustment of our economy in 1985 following a period when the U.S. Dollar was clearly overvalued in world terms  but benefiting as that currency subsequently declined.  He said that since the establishment of the link in 1983  Hong Kong's trade had been broadly in balance. This year a modest deficit was expected.  Under the link  Hong Kong's entirely free and open economy continues to adjust quickly to any external imbalances  but the burden of adjustment now falls almost entirely on our domestic interest rates  money supply and price levels   Nendick said.  The relative volatility in these domestic variables is the price we pay for the stability of our currency against the U.S. Dollar   he said."
"2","The Asian Development Bank (ADB)today wound up a three-day meeting which was marked by criticism of the ADB from both rich and poor member nations. In speech after speech  the 20-year-old ADB was charged either with not doing enough to help countries in the region  or with funding projects which were not worthwhile. The attacks often  but not always  broke down along developed and developing country lines. The former  which provide the ADB with money  generally emphasized the need for quality projects. The ADB was not even spared criticism from its host country and largest shareholder  Japan.  I am not 100 pct satisfied with the performance of the ADB   Japanese finance ministry deputy director-general Fumiya Iwasaki told Reuters. He said the Bank had only approved five pct more new loans in 1986 than in 1985. He hoped for a return to the more rapid growth rates of earlier years.  The Asian economy is now changing. The ADB should adapt itself to those changes   he said. But supporters of the ADB said it already was changing  and Iwasaki made it clear Japan welcomed the steps being taken by the ADB's president Masao Fujioka.  So far  we have confidence in Mr Fujioka's leadership   Iwasaki said. To spur demand for loans  the ADB has restructured its country and agricultural departments to enable it to identify the needs of developing member countries more quickly. But some delegates said the ADB was putting too much emphasis on the need to give out more money  and not enough on checking the quality of the projects involved.  The success of the Bank should not be measured by the volume of its lending but by its contribution to the development process   chief U.S. Delegate Charles H. Dallara told the meeting. He said:  Project quality is an area which has attracted attention recently and on which the United States has expressed strong views. Although over the years the majority of ADB loans have been sound  we have had problems with some of the projects brought before the board of directors lately.  Australia voiced similar concerns. Australian delegate C. J. Hurford said:  Bad projects benefit neither the Bank nor its borrowers. They damage the Bank's reputation and ultimately lessen support from donor countries and capital markets.  There were also criticisms of proposals from developing countries that the ADB make more of its loans dependent on economic reforms in Third World nations.  We are concerned with the Bank's increasing preoccupation with dialogue   said India's delegate  S. Venkitaramanan.  We have expressed our unhappiness with the insistence of multi-lateral agencies on global prescriptions   he said."
"2","China is likely to borrow up to300 mln dlrs this year from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  president Masao Fujioka said. The loans would be China's first from the ADB.  I think there will be at least one loan to China this year  and possibly a second   Fujioka told a news conference at the end of the ADB's annual meeting here. Asked how large the loans were likely to be  Fujioka said he thought they would range from 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs each. China is the ADB's newest member  joining in March 1986. China is the third-largest shareholder after Japan and the U.S.. It was elected to the ADB's 12-member board yesterday. Fujioka announced that the ADB's 1989 meeting would be held in Peking. The 1988 meeting will be held in Manila. Fujioka said the ADB would consider delegates' suggestions that it set up a task force of experts to define its future role. The ADB's performance was criticised by both its rich and poor members at the three-day meeting just finished. External experts had carried out a study on ADB policy for the 1980s  Fujioka said. He said a similar study for the 1990s would be useful  but the ADB had no fixed ideas yet. He said the ADB had already responded to members like the U.S.  Which urged it to improve analysis of funded projects.  We had already decided that the ADB should strengthen its research capability   Fujioka said. He said ADB lending had declined  but  the amount is not the only thing that counts. We also want to be a catalyst by taking innovative measures like the promotion of the private sector.  Fujioka also talked of the struggle between the U.S. And Japan over their voting power in the ADB. Total Japanese contributions to the ADB are higher than those of the U.S.  So Japanese delegates asked for their voting power to reflect this. The U.S. Opposed the move.  It is advisable and wise  for institutions like the ADB to be viable  that there be a reasonable relationship between financial contributions and voting power   Fujioka said. But he indicated the problem remained unresolved. Asked if the ADB would respond to a plea by Vietnam to resume lending which was cut off in 1974  Fujioka re-iterated his view that conditions there were not conducive to banking. Fujioka declined to elaborate on Vietnam  but said there had been no pressure from the U.S. Or any other country on the issue. He also spoke about demands by the bank's financiers that it take a more active role in prodding borrowers into making economic policy changes.  The initiative must come from the borrowing country. We don't accept that we impose policy conditions. There must be a two-way consultation   he said."
"2","The Soviet Union's first officialobserver at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said he came away from this week's ADB annual meeting with a favourable impression but that no decision has been made on whether the Soviet Union should join as a full member. Yurij V. Ponomarev  international managing director of the State Bank  said he will file a formal report when he returns to Moscow  but it will not contain any recommendation on membership.  We haven't started any process with a view toward membership   he said. Ponomarev downplayed the significance of his attendance  saying it only signalled a slight change in attitude by Moscow. Although this is the first time Moscow has attended the ADB's annual meeting as an observer  Soviet bankers have come to meetings in the past as guests  he said. Delegates here saw the Soviet move as part of an overall strategy to strengthen ties with Asia and improve the functioning of the Soviet economy. Ponomarev declined to comment on remarks yesterday by a senior U.S. Official  who warned that Soviet membership in the ADB would cause serious operational problems.  How would the ADB  for instance  use the (Soviet) rouble as a basis for expanding its capital?  asked the U.S. Official  who declined to be identified. Ponomarev said:  It is far too premature to speculate on the potential difficulties that might be involved if we applied for membership.  In order to become a member  Moscow would have to gain the backing of two-thirds of the board of governors representing three-quarters of the voting power of member countries. Washington has just over a 12 pct voting share."
"2","Washington views with concern aplan to increase Japan's voting power at the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  a U.S. Delegate at the bank's annual meeting said. Japan  which holds 15.1 pct of the ADB's capital stock  and the U.S. Which holds 14.9 pct  currently have near-parity in voting power.  The ADB was set up in 1966 as a partnership between the U.S. And Japan   the official said.  Any change in that relationship would transmit a psychological message to this region's countries that there is a slackening of interest on the part of the U.S.   We do not want any dilution of our influence in the organisation   the U.S. Official added. He said an imbalance in procurement contracts awarded for ADB-funded projects was however improving slowly. The U.S. Share of the contracts had grown from about seven pct to about 12 pct in 1986  the official said  while Japan's share had dropped from 25 pct to 20 pct.  We will urge more U.S. Businessmen to join in the bidding for these projects   he said. The official said Washington was concerned about the ADB's future role in the region.  The U.S. Believes the ADB should act as a catalyst both for policy changes that will lead to sustainable  long-term economic growth and for other financial flows   chief U.S. Delegate Charles Dallara told the meeting earlier.  Economic reform should be a theme of the ADB's lending   the unidentified U.S. Official said.  The bank is doing its borrowers a disservice by not entering into policy dialogue   he added.  We are looking for the bank to take up the cudgel when its borrowers are at a critical stage in their development. We are looking at a 15 or 20 year horizon."
"2","Unemployment in the EuropeanCommunity fell in March to 16.8 mln from 17 mln in February thanks to an improvement in the weather  the EC's statistics agency Eurostat said. It said the number of jobless fell in all 12 Community member states as weather conditions improved  though France  Italy and Spain saw declines of less than one pct. There was also a particularly large drop in the number of jobless under-25s in all states except Italy  where 19 300 more young people were unemployed in March than in the month before."
"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman  Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker  told a news conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks  with the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served little more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex package of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would result in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European currency units  to help the EC's cash crisis  and changes in the conversion of EC common farm prices into national currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and Dutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences between EC states on the oils tax proposal  the currency measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated measures. But he told journalists   We have used this meeting to reach the point at which real negotiations can start at the next meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our procedures took much longer than planned.  Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package by April 1 each year  although this target is seldom reached in practice. Diplomats said on all the points there were widely diverging views  with Britain and the Netherlands  the countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals price cuts  strongly opposed to the oils tax. However  de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to resolve.  This is a very tough political nut  and because of the very nature of the problem there is no technical solution   he said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his proposals to make an agreement easier. However  because of the EC's budgetary crisis  he had little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers  led by Germany's Ignaz Kiechle  are demanding. EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five billion Ecus by the end of this year  even if the commission farm price package is adopted in its entirety."
"2","Belgian Agriculture Minister Paul deKeersmaeker said he would review EC Commission proposals for a tax on imported and EC produced vegetable oils and fats in the light of objections made by certain EC member states. De Keersmaeker  current chairman of the EC farm ministers' council  was speaking after a three-day meeting of ministers at which the tax proposal was one of the key themes. He said he would review the position as part of plans to present compromise proposals for the 1987/88 farm price package to the next meeting  starting in Brussels on May 18. De Keersmaeker  who said there was  a great deal of resistance in many delegations  to the tax  declined to say what aspects of the proposals he would review. However  EC Commission sources said they are expected to include the question of whether it should apply to marine oils. They said Denmark and Portugal might agree to the tax  to be set initially at 330 Ecus a tonne  if these oils  of which they are major producers  were excluded. The sources said  however  that Britain  the Netherlands and West Germany continue to have strong objections to the tax  partly because of fears that its impact on U.S. Soybean exports could provoke transatlantic trade friction. They said that  if these three countries held firm to this position  they would be able to block the proposal under the EC's majority voting mechanism."
"2","It is vitally important that theindustrialised countries of the world work towards convergence of their economies and economic policies  U.S. Ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Edward Streator said. He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world was changing rapidly and national attitudes had to alter accordingly if growth was not to falter and world depression set in. Liberalisation of world trade in money  goods and services and technology was an overriding goal  he added. World financial flows were now 12 times as large as traditional trade flows  the importance of commodities was declining rapidly  countries such as those on the Pacific Rim were becoming major growth areas  and the labour element in manufacturing was declining sharply  Streator said. All these factors were creating major social and economic pressures and demanding a rapid reassessment of traditional attitudes  he added.  Agriculture is a prime target for change.One of the first things we must do is disconnect farm subsidies from production   Streator said. At an OECD ministerial meeting in two weeks time there would be an attempt to agree global principles to help reduce this major agricultural problem  Streator said.  However  of equal and vital importance in reducing the world's dangerous slide towards protectionism will be the outcome of the new round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)   Streator added. Dutch finance minister Onno Ruding  who also spoke briefly at the lunch  stressed the importance of coordinating national policies and of the GATT talks in preventing a rapid decline into bilateralism and global protectionism."
"2","Egypt has embarked on reforms sought bythe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank by raising the price of diesel oil and other types of transport fuels. The energy price increases were the first visible measures taken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans. Effective today  fuel oil prices were trebled and prices of gas oil  diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct  an Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He said fuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton  instead of 7.5 pounds. Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for five piasters a litre  while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters. The government is expected also to act soon  possibly as early as next weekend  to simplify the country's complex exchange rate system  bankers said. Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the pound was part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditor governments. In return  Egypt stands to receive up to one billion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years to help it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guarantee rescheduling by western governments  the main creditors. Energy price increases were also a condition of progress on World Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy  communications and other sectors which have been under negotiation for several months  western diplomats said. The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backing for President Hosni Mubarak's government  committed to a multi-party political system and peace with Israel and strategically poised in control of the Suez Canal. Fuel price rises  postponed at least once and likely to lead to higher retail prices of basic goods  were a test of the government's resolve to pursue economic reform  diplomats said. But the new prices are still below world market levels. There was no announcement of increases in more politically sensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas  used for cooking  and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said they would stay the same. Official comment was not available on speculation among bankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinker with the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollars into the banking system away from the illegal but tolerated free market. The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee in which 10 commercial banks  including the four state-owned banks  would decide the pound's value every day. The official  incentive rate   currently set by the Central Bank daily  is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar  against 2.15 on the free market. Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set rates around 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aim of curbing the free market."
"2","The European Commission should make urgentand concrete proposals to break the deadlock over moves to cut sky-high European airfares  an independent report said. The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) said costs  fares and profits on international services within Europe are the highest in the world although European airlines are less efficient and not perceptibly safer than their cheaper U.S. Equivalents.  The European airlines protect their position through the secrecy they maintain over the costs and profits of any group of services   the report said. The airlines also protect themselves through  the ferocity with which (they) resist any relaxation of the monopolistic practices which protect their profits   the report said. Britain  a strong advocate of deregulation  has been trying to push measures to introduce greater competition among Europe's airlines but negotiations foundered at the end of 1986 over discount and deep discount fares. The IEA report said European governments and the Commission  the EC executive authority  had been extraordinarily lax about the airlines' secretiveness  showing  a lack of concern for the interests of the traveller."
"2","Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.  I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines   Romero said in an interview. He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position. Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany  the Netherlands  Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides  and if that happened opposition could crumble. Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin  a carcinogenic chemical. He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal  which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988  was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground. Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally  but this was likely to take several years of research. Copra meal exports were 817 641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs. Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether.  There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra   Romero said.  We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products  or we can go to the chemical root.  He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop.  In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production  and I'm not comfortable with that   he said. With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil  a coconut oil substitute  palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971  Romero said.  To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart   he said. Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents. Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests. He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year  to add to the production fall  drought had affected output.  Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing  adding more value   he said. Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees  he said.  A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10 000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space   Romero said. He said the government's proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.  If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels  production and employment then it won't happen   he said. PCA figures show about one-third of the country's population is dependent on the coconut industry. Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land."
"2","Crude oil prices could remain around 18dlrs a barrel until the end of the year  but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor  an official of Mexico's state oil company  Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex)  told a group of Japanese businessmen. Adrian Lajous  Pemex' executive vice president of international trade  said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter.  Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned  while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago   he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price  and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.  I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions   Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year  when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs  is always there as a possibility  he said.  I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained   he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets  but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month  that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output  were  very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer."
"2","Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy withthe intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization's buffer stock manager  industry sources told Reuters.  The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it   one company spokesman said. Including the 3 000 tonnes he acquired on Friday  the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21 000 tonnes. Despite this buying  the price of cocoa is well under the 1 600 Special Drawing Rights  SDRs  a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.  Even before he started operations  traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75 000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1 600 SDR level  and yet he appears reluctant to do so   one manufacturer said.  We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75 000 tonnes in a fairly short period  and then simply step back   he added.  The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next   one processor said.  As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums  and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods   he added. Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come."
"2","Brazil is not selling cocoa beansto the International Cocoa Organization  ICCO  buffer stock  as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock manager  trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said. The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels  the sources noted. The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments  they added. If sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission  they said."
"2","European Community diplomats said thequestion of whether Eurobonds will fall under proposed EC rules requiring new securities issues in Community countries to be preceded by a prospectus has yet to be resolved. The U.K. Securities industry has been lobbying hard against an EC Commission proposal  aimed at protecting investors  that would require publication and approval of a prospectus before all public offers of securities. The proposed directive currently includes Eurobonds  although it makes an exception to the prospectus rules for issues directed exclusively at professional investors. Diplomats said that with Britain tending towards backing West Germany and Luxembourg in their opposition to the inclusion of Eurobonds  the question of whether they would remain within the scope of the directive or not was wide open.  Everything is in the melting pot   said one diplomat who declined to be named. The diplomats said Belgium has now given up attempts to have the directive adopted by EC ministers before it hands over the presidency of the 12-nation Community to Denmark on July 1. It was not immediately clear what priority the Danes would attach to getting the proposals through during their six month tenure. Meanwhile  discussions on the directive at working group level have halted  diplomats said. Officials of the EC Commission said it recognised that its proposals created a conflict between the need for greater protection of investors  on the one hand  and for banks and other institutions to place Eurobonds quickly  on the other.  It's a problem and we are still in the grips of internal debate as to the right line to take   said one Commission official. Eurobonds were not included in the original draft directive  first put forward in 1981  but were brought into its scope later at the request of a number of EC member states. Diplomats said countries that oppose the inclusion of Eurobonds in the proposals are worried that the prospectus requirements would prevent the thriving Eurobond market from functioning as well as it does now.  With timing so essential to the market for placing and distribution  there's just not time to deal with these bureaucratic hurdles   said one. He and others said the overriding concern was that the requirements could drive the Eurobond market out of traditional EC centres like London and Luxembourg to Switzerland  the U.S. Or Japan. Diplomats said the Eurobond question is not the only issue that needs to be resolved before the directive can be passed. They said West Germany's main objection to the directive in its present form is that it considers as too stringent proposed rules laying down how much information companies issuing non-listed securities should disclose in their prospectuses. The proposed rules create problems for West Germany because its new second tier securities market has less demanding requirements that would have to be tightened."
"2","The French Cereals Intervention Board(ONIC) will tender Wednesday for 20 000 tonnes soft wheat for Pakistan under the French food aid programme  an ONIC official said.

"2","A new steel quota system that wouldstrictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own solution quickly  officials said. EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln tonnes by 1990. The first would limit the current quota system  which has protected EC output for seven years  only to flat products and heavy sections  thereby forcing other types of steel products into free market competition. The second proposal would link continuation of a quota system with progress toward plant closures  although less than a month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily. The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution immediately  instead urging steel producers to try again to reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks. The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed proposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC industry ministers meet again in September to reach a final decision."
"2","Traders recently returned from West Africasay some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far  only 21 000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this  traders noted  only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases  of 8 000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13 000 in the second  are well short of the limitations of no more than 5 000 tonnes in one day and 20 000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far  noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1 935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However  little progress has been made in that direction  and the 10-day average is still well below the 1 600 sdr lower intervention level at 1 562.87 from 1 569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow  although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic  traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers  they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London  traders expressed surprise that no more than 21 000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150 000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100 000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close  basis July at its high of 1 271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market  prices go up  while when he declares his intention to buy  quite often the reverse applies  traders said."
"2","European free market tin traders made asomewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October. Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current  free market  system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange  LME  tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that  while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point  a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange  but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4 200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3 400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4 680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8 140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10 350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28 065 tonnes  having fallen steadily from a record high of 72 485 tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28 000/29 000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5 000 stg per tonne during 1987. However  the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4 100 stg last month after approaching 4 700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45 000 tonnes have now been almost halved  and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal. Some 80 000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's  ITC  buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers  which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations  unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries  ATPC  has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella  but to date Brazil and China  two major producers  remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres  dealers said."
"2","European Community (EC)Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen said his proposal for a tax of up to 330 European Currency Units per tonne on oils and fats was likely to go up for discussion at next week's summit meeting of EC leaders. EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax  one of the main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farm price package. The tax  which would apply on both domestically-produced and imported oils and fats  has been fiercely opposed by the United States and developing countries' vegetable and marine oil producers."

"2","British Airways is looking forward toindustry deregulation in Europe and believes it will be a smoother transition than the turmoil that followed the opening of the U.S. skies  its chief executive said. Colin Marshall told Reuters that Europe will phase in deregulation gradually to avoid the problems created in the U.S. in the late 1970s -- fast growth  unstable fares  new carriers that went bankrupt and ultimately years of losses for even the largest airlines.  In Europe we have the benefit of learning from the American experience   Marshall said.  When you add that to the conservative nature of the Europeans  it amounts to an approach that is slower and more cautious.  Airline liberalization  as it is called  must first be approved by the transportation ministers of the European Community nations. This could come this month when the ministers meet to take it up  Marshall said in an interview during a U.S. visit to talk to airline industry analysts.  As the largest airline in Europe  and with the sophisticated computer systems we have to help us with yield and load factors management  I think we have a very good chance  if not the best chance  of doing well in a liberalized situation in Europe   Marshall said. Airline market deregulation in Europe will open up new routes between European countries  allow established carriers to grow and permit new airlines to begin operations. It will also free airlines to fly more seats on any given route -- something that is highly regulated now -- and to base fares on market forces. Discount fares in Europe might even become more widespread.  We think liberalization will help stimulate traffic   Marshall said. Lower fares have been offered by British carriers since domestic services in Britain were deregulated in 1984  he said. But passengers taking return flights or from other countries pay higher  regulated prices. Marshall said deregulation will spawn more European airlines  possibly to be followed by a spate of mergers  as is happening in the United States. Two airlines  Sabena and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS)  are now discussing a merger. Their success  might open up Europe to further merger activity   he said. This is because an SAS-Sabena merger could be a test case to determine whether countries are willing to allow landing rights to be transferred from one carrier to another  he said."

"2","Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would not accept a  mad  increase that would drive consumers away. He told al-Riyadh newspaper   Saudi Arabia follows a balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and find alternative sources (for energy).  OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel. OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25  where it will review its current oil price and production policy. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil prices to remain stable for the next two years. Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and production pact  which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of 15.8 mln bpd  and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs a barrel average."
"2","China took a serious view of a Multi-FibreAgreement (MFA) protocol which it said infringed principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  the People's Daily overseas edition said. It quoted a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade as saying the protocol  signed on July 31 last year and which extended the MFA for five years  would affect international textile trade by broadening curbs in it. Fifty major textile trading countries adopted the new MFA last July in Geneva  limiting Third World exports of textiles to industrialised countries. The newspaper said China signed the protocol on May 31  10 months after it was signed by other nations. A U.S. Diplomat said the U.S. And China had had months of talks on the issue  with the U.S. Saying that it would have to introduce unilateral restraints if China did not sign. He said that the new MFA pact extended controls to silk and ramie in addition to existing ones on cotton and man-made fibres. China  the world's biggest producer of ramie and a major silk producer  had flooded the U.S. Market the previous two years with goods made from both and from linen because these three categories were not under quota  the diplomat said. It had become the biggest supplier by volume  though not by value  of textiles to the U.S.  With exports in the first five months of this year up by 24 pct from the same 1986 period. He estimated total 1987 textile exports would be 15 pct up on the 1986 level. Chinese customs figures show exports of textile yarn  fabrics  made-up articles and related products to the U.S. In calendar 1986 as being worth 1.314 billion yuan  up from 870 mln in 1985. The diplomat said China and the U.S. Had held two rounds of talks on drawing up a new three to five-year textile pact  to replace the present one  due to expire at the end of 1987. They involved discussion of overshipment of Chinese textiles this year to the U.S. Due to counterfeit licences  a problem the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade admitted to last week  he said  but gave no more details."
"2","Japan is disappointed at the recent threatsof trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as the trade situation between the two is improving  Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.  I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement   he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides. Last week  foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports. Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31.  I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion.   While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC  I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints  but by expanding the (overall) trade   Tamura said."
"2","The Venice summit on June 8-10 is likelyto disappoint those hoping for new policies to whip up flagging world growth  according to officials from summit countries. Worries over protectionist threats and the Third World debt crisis are also unlikely to be assuaged  they added. The talks may yield agreed statements on the military situation in the Gulf  co-operation in the fight against the killer disease AIDS or on East-West relations  they said. But most summit participants have made it clear that major new initiatives on economic issues must not be expected. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a recent interview that  the translation of previous announcements into policy is more important than new declarations and commitments.  The main goal at the summit would be to strengthen existing agreements to secure steady medium term growth and avoid  the danger of a further devaluation of the dollar  via close co-operation on economic and financial policies  Kohl added. Critics challenged this view. They pointed to the worrying background of slower growth  especially in Japan and Germany  amid fears about a pickup in inflation in the U.S. Which could lead to higher interest rates and exacerbate the debt crisis. The marginal impact that the major shifts in dollar  yen and mark exchange rates have had on the Japanese and German trade surpluses and U.S. Trade and fiscal deficits since the September 1985 Plaza agreement was also a cause for concern. Economists said the recent rise in the dollar was likely to be quickly reversed in the absence of new commitments in Venice. But government officials do not expect summit delegations - from the U.S.  Japan  Germany  Britain  France  Italy  Canada and the European Community - to go much beyond restating policy goals enshrined in the February Louvre agreement of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers. Under the agreement  aimed at halting the dollar's 20-month decline and at fostering balanced growth  Japan and West Germany would work to eliminate their trade and payments surpluses in return for a U.S. Pledge to reduce fiscal deficits. A 6 000 billion yen package announced by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week went some way towards that goal and appeared to have saved Japan from a widely anticipated summit attack on its economic policies  officials said. The package  featuring government spending and tax cuts to stimulate demand  drew a cautious welcome in European capitals but its reception in the U.S. Was much more enthusiastic. Treasury Secretary James Baker commented   Of course  implementation is the key  but this is clearly forward movement toward fulfillment by Japan of its commitments.  With Japan signalling its willingness to boost domestic demand rather than rely on exports for growth  the U.S. And other summit countries were now set to shift their attention to West Germany and press Kohl for similar action  officials said. U.S. Assistant treasury secretary David Mulford said there was worldwide concern that German economic growth has flagged  and the U.S. Would demand that Kohl confirm a commitment that policies would be reviewed if growth continued sluggish. But West German officials said Kohl would fiercely resist any such pressure. One senior Bonn official said   There is just no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves.  Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has problems finding cash to finance tax cuts promised for 1990  and is reluctantly letting government borrowing rise  Bonn officials said. Citing fierce opposition by West Germany and Britain  European officials also ruled out progress on U.S. Plans for a more formal strategy for coordinating economic policies  based on a series of economic indicators. The U.S. Wants other Group of Seven countries to agree to high level consultations when the indicators  including trade  growth  interest and exchange rates  inflation and fiscal deficits  show members are not living up to economic commitments. But Germany and Britain fear the plan would undermine economic sovereignty  and Britain also feels the proposals are too complicated and too rigid  officials said. Recent developments on Third World debt  including moves by two of the largest U.S. Banks to set aside billions of dollars to cover bad loans  will feature prominently in the talks. U.S. And Japanese officials said they would seek to reactivate the Baker initiative at the summit and renew a call to commercial banks to come up with a  menu of alternatives  to restore some new bank lending to debtor countries. Officials said there was also scope for agreement on a Franco-British plan aimed at alleviating the burden for the world's poorest debtor countries through concessional rescheduling of their sovereign debt at the Paris Club. The talks would also include plans to dismantle runaway farm subsidies all summit nations pay to guarantee the income of their farmers and secure a share of world markets  they said. The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last month supported a gradual decoupling of farm production subsidies from income support for farmers. The U.S.  Canada and Britain in particular are keen to move quickly after the OECD breakthrough  officials said.  What we want is not for treasuries to compete as they do now. We want to see to it that our farmers will be able to compete in international markets   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said. The U.S. Intends to table specific proposals on the issue at GATT  the world trade body  immediately after the summit to signal that it wants negotiations on farm trade to take precedence over the other trade issues included in the new GATT round of talks launched last year in Punta del Este  Uruguay.  We won't have much tolerance for delay   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. But European officials said they would resist such moves  making an agreement at the summit unlikely. France and other EC countries insist that farm trade disputes be resolved as part of a wider trade settlement within GATT  they said."

"2","The World Bank  in the throes of apainful reorganization  faces new strains because of actions by Citibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves  financial analysts and monetary sources said. The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused some bad feelings and charges that promotions and other personnel actions have been based on personality rather than ability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role in the global debt strategy  the sources said. At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber Conable  whose reorganization efforts are getting some critical review from many Bank staff members and some member- countries including the United States.  I think if he were to do it again  he would do it very differently   said one source. Conable  a former congressman from New York appointed by President Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly a year ago  has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be reorganized and perhaps made more streamlined. In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan administration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market sources of assistance were available. However  the Bank had been singled out for a much greater role under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury Secretary James Baker.  That strategy  which called for some 20 billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine billion dlrs in spending from the development banks  mostly the World Bank  came under profound doubt with the decision by Citibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves. This move  heralded by some sources as a measure that gives all parties more time  frightened others  who see it as the beginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete unraveling of the monetary system. As envisioned by the latter  the next move would be for Brazil  which has delayed payments on its debts  to say it does not intend to pay interest for a very long period of time. Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop financing the country's export credits  the funds countries use to support their daily activities  leading to an economic breakdown.  Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of business   said one source. Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three billion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans to developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by Chase Manhattan some days later. In the best of all worlds  the kind of cooperation that was demonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the multilateral development banks  the wealthy countries and commercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982  could emerge again but no one is expecting that. If anything  the negotiations have become much more confrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more concessions  arguing that they face growing political instability if they are asked to do or pay more. They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and there is sympathy for their view among the development community.  When you hear code words like structural adjustment and tightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent making 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs   says one source. He adds:  And when your hear they should have market forces at play  that means the level of public services should drop.  It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role in the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the debtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent poverty even further. The Bank  which primarily assists countries in the building of roads  sewerage systems  education  and other so-called infrastructure  is viewed in the Third World as benefactor. The IMF  however  which essentially forged the debt stategy following the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near default  is considered a stern taskmaster that has little sympathy or even understanding of poverty. But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative has worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about increased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription which indicated that countries might grow their way out of their difficulty."
"2","The Secretary-General of the AfricanDevelopment Bank expressed confidence in the institution's ability to handle potential problems with repayment of development financing loans. Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference at the bank's headquarters that loan arrears were only 80 mln dlrs at present  a small percentage of total ADB lending which exceeded one billion dlrs in 1986. Some commercial banks have recently taken extraordinary measures to deal with third world lending strategies.  We do have difficulty with repayment of loans on time   Dei-Anang said. But he denied than any ADB loan arrears were more than 12 months behind schedule.  We have never had a default. We have never written off a loan   he added. Dei-Anang said the Abidjan-based ADB will hold its annual general meeting in Cairo from June 9 to June 11 and over 1 000 delegates were expected to attend. The agenda will include the approval of the bank's annual report and accounts  but there will be no debate on the capital increase which is currently being voted on by the ADB governors. An ADB spokeswoman said the U.S. Had voted for a 200 pct increase in the bank's capital  but other votes were still coming in. In December  an ad-hoc committee of the ADB's board of governors  comprising 18 African and non-African countries  agreed that a 200 pct increase was necessary to finance a rise in lending between 1987 and 1991. If the recommendations are approved by the board  the capital of the bank would rise from around 6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs. Dei-Anang said the capital increase would help the bank improve its borrowing capacity.  The capital increase is in effect a passport to the capital market   he said.  It will enable us to borrow something like 4.5 billion dlrs in the next five years   he added."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) buffer stock manager bought 5 000 tonnes of cocoa today for the buffer stock  traders said.

"2","Plans to provide direct incomeaids for European Community (EC) small farmers to help them face deep cuts in guaranteed crop prices received a mixed reception from EC agriculture ministers  EC officials said. The plans were discussed at an informal meeting of the ministers hosted in the village of Genval by the Council of Ministers' current chairman  Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker. The EC Executive Commission has proposed that the richer member states be allowed to make direct payments to their farmers in special difficulties  while the EC itself would finance a similar scheme in the poorer EC countries. However  EC officials said only the Netherlands and Luxembourg supported this idea at today's meeting  and France  Denmark and Belgium showed marked hostility to it. French minister Francois Guillaume told reporters   Farmers should not become recipients of public assistance -- their survival should be assured by price mechanisms and the market.  The officials said the ministers had not sought to resolve their more urgent differences over guaranteed farm prices for 1987/88 at this meeting. The ministers will resume talks on the price fixing issue in Luxembourg on June 15."
"2","A plea for extra cash to bail theEuropean Community (EC) out of its latest financial crisis was likely to be rejected at a meeting today of EC budget ministers  diplomats said. The ministers were meeting for the first time since the EC Executive Commission unveiled an emergency budget for 1987 aimed at plugging a deficit caused by soaring farm spending and falling revenues. The emergency package includes a demand for member states to pay an extra 1.5 billion European currency units (Ecus) to help meet the deficit. Officials said Britain and West Germany were expected to lead opposition to contributing any extra cash  with the U.K insisting instead on a clampdown on runaway farm spending. The Commission says there will be a shortfall of at least five billion Ecus this year  more than 1/8 of total spending. It hopes to make up much of the shortfall in a one-time accounting exercise by paying member states in arrears rather than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies. But if member states do not make up the rest of the gap  the Commission has warned that spending on regional and social projects could be slashed by half."
"2","European Community officials welcomedNorway's recent move to renew a public debate on Community membership but said Norway should not expect special trade advantages as long as it stays outside the EC. Belgian Willy de Clercq  EC Commissioner on external affairs and trade policy  said high level talks this week with Norway's minority Labour government had helped clarify several misconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of EC membership in a 1972 referendum.  But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outside the club. You can expect equal footing in the club  but not out of it   de Clercq added  referring to Norway's attempts to adapt its EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch an internal trade market from 1992. The government  worried that the internal market will hamper trade with the EC  which takes about two-thirds of Norway's exports  last month sent a report to parliament asking political parties and the public to reassess the country's relationship to the EC."

ADB secretary general Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference he hoped the bank's governors would approve such an agreement at the ADB annual general meeting next week in Cairo. The bank is seeking cooperative agreements with various international organisations including IACO  he said. Dei-Anang said the ADB and IACO could cooperate on all fronts and an exchange of information would enable them to identify areas where the bank might help the coffee industry."
"2","Developing countries said the EuropeanCommunity (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax. Ambassadors to the EC from African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries. They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides. They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices. The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption  which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year. EC farm ministers  who would have to approve such a tax  are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15. Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports.  We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries  but such would be the impact of these measures   Wilson said. The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved. Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only  as a very last resort   but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan. Wilson  who was chairing the news conference  made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats. Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast  Senegal  Nigeria and Papua New Guinea  the ACP says."
"2","Overseas Shipholding Group Inc presidentMorton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the second half of 1987  freight rates for tankers should rise accordingly. Hyman  delivering a speech at the annual shareholders meeting  said international tanker markets were generally weak throughout the first quarter  but since the end of March OPEC oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest improvement in tanker rates. Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.  He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose. For the first quarter 1987  the company reported net income of 10.3 mln dlrs  or 40 cts per share  compared to 9.3 mln dlrs  or 36 cts per share  for the comparable quarter a year ago. The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs  or 1.45 dlrs per share.   The improvement in the company's 1986 results  after four years of declining earnings  reflects a sharp  albeit temporary  rise in freight rates in the international tanker markets last summer   Hyman said. He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet  which represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage. Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels."
"2","The buffer stock manager of theInternational Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about 3 000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday  June 3  the ICCO said in a statement.

The basis position will be afloat  May/July shipment or June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account. The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins.

"2","The European Community was set toplunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministers failed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in the near-bankrupt Community's finances  diplomats said. As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks in Luxembourg  diplomats said there was little basis for an accord amongst the trading bloc's 12 member states. The EC executive Commission says the Community faces a deficit this year of at least five billion European Currency Units and could be forced to choose between massive spending cuts or bankruptcy. It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5 billion ECUs to help meet the deficit  caused by soaring farm spending and falling revenues. But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted that there can be no extra cash for the Community this year and instead call for a clampdown on farm spending  which absorbs two thirds of the EC budget.  We have to make clear that expenses should be based on income   West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer told reporters.  There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financing in the form of national contributions   he added. A second Commission proposal  which would plug most of the budget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies  was also far from agreement  diplomats added. The proposal  strongly backed by Britain and West Germany  would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed for two months. But poorer member states  which would have to borrow funds to cover the delay  complain the change in the system would unfairly impose too much of the burden on them. The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an early debate on the changeover in the farm payments system  further delaying any moves to solve the deficit problem  parliamentary sources said."

"2","The European Community (EC) shouldwatch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and their consequences on the oil market  EC Energy Commissioner Nicolas Mosar said today. Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the Gulf  Mosar warned   An escalation in the Gulf would increase tensions in the oil market.   But I do not want to be alarmist   he told a news conference after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg. He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last year.  There are also other potential sources of supplies in the world   he added. The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the ministers' meeting  he added. A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual meeting on June 19  he said. But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC foreign ministers  diplomats said. West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil supplies."
"2","Paul Volcker's resignation as FederalReserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a time of deep uncertainty about the future management of the third-world debt crisis  bankers said. They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold the financial system together when Mexico halted interest payments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever since.  Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly there's a terrible void   one New York banker said. Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed because International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it hard to make a mark as World Bank president  bankers said. Moreover  Volcker's successor  Alan Greenspan  has little experience of international affairs and third world debt.  Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues and the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker has. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S. That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive feeling   one banker said. This banker  who has discussed debt questions with Greenspan  described his views as simplistic. But Robert Hormats of Goldman  Sachs and Co said he was not worried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.  People rush to judgment  but once they get to know Greenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement   said Hormats  a former Administration official. Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the initial comparison  Hormats said.  Volcker had the status of a financial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight   he said. One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker  together with the Bank of England  deserves credit for keeping the banking system intact after Mexico's default.  If it hadn't been for him  the world would look a lot different now   he said.  Whether you agreed with him or not  he has a superb grasp of ideas.  Certainly  not all bankers did agree all the time with Volcker. In particular  he was roundly criticized by some for more or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico generous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt rescheduling agreement.  Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the bounds and pushing the package onto the banks   commented one banker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal. Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed  who said the 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and thus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets. It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of others that followed it for Chile  Venezuela  the Philippines and Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt crisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to bolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.  It certainly contributed to the general feeling of malaise   one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of the Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses. That decision  since followed by Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific Corp  may profoundly alter the strategy of creditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis. But no one is sure what the impact will be.  It's very difficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is going  and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the uncertainty   one banker said."
"2","Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30  Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens said today. Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm price package which has endured since March. Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had to be referred to heads of government. These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and vegetable fats and oils  and proposals to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in European currency units (Ecus)  are translated into the currencies of member states. The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S.  A major exporter of soybeans to the EC. West Germany  meanwhile  is strongly against the technical currency move  which would result in additional price cuts for farmers in countries with strong currencies  such as the mark. Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean heads of government diverting their attention from much more important world and Community issues. Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest themselves in such technically complex questions. However  Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some nuances in member state positions  which may make the dialogue more constructive in the next few weeks.  If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month  the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct cut in cereals prices  farm trade sources said. It originally proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this year  with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops. Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency reforms. The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year. Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's meeting very useful  diplomats said there was little sign of a major shift in the position of member states  or of finance ministers adopting a different line from that of their agriculture colleagues. The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their differences."
"2","Africa's efforts to revive itseconomy are not being matched by international help  two of the continent's heads of state said at the opening of a conference. Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou- Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to act over the continent's debt  which now totals 175 billion dlrs  at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). Their view was backed by Monique Landry  Canada's Minister for External Relations.  Whether we look at aid or debt or trade  the rich countries have not as yet lived up to their part of last year's economic recovery pact.  Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country to spend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicing particularly as prices for the continent's commodities were so unstable. Sassou Nguesso  current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity  accused international aid donors of failing to provide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago. The conference  attended by African ministers  economists and representatives from major donors  will review progress since both sides agreed at the U.N. Last year to revive the African economy over five years. The response from the international community has been negative and projections of improved growth rates for Africa already look far too optimistic  ECA Executive Secretary Adebayo Adedeji told the conference. Both Babangida and Sassou Nguesso called for the debts of Africa's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment and grace terms to be eased. They won a degree of support from Landry   Even private bankers are willing to talk about the need for longer term solutions to Africa's debt."
"2","Spain has joined the group ofEuropean Community countries opposed to the proposed tax on marine and vegetable oils and fats  diplomatic sources said. They said the Spanish position was clarified at a joint meeting here of EC finance and agriculture ministers to discuss the budgetary situation surrounding this year's EC farm price negotiations. Previously  West Germany  Britain  Portugal and Denmark have declared themselves against the tax with Spain's position unclear  the sources said. The sources said Spanish junior finance minister Guillermo de la Dehesa said Spain was against the tax because of its implications for world trade talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and because it was discrimatory by excluding butter. They said the countries now opposed to the tax have far more votes than needed under the EC's majority voting system to block the proposal."
"2","The proposed European Community (EC) levyon oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO  the association of EC biscuit  chocolate and confectionery manufacturers. In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers  M. Eyskens  the association said the tax would cost the EC biscuit  cake  chocolate and confectionery industries almost 200 mln European currency units per year. The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S. Retaliatory measures on EC exports  CAOBISCO said. In a parallel move the British Biscuit  Cake  Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy. President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending the Commission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumer taxation  an area previously reserved for national treasuries."
"2","An International Sugar Organization (ISO)committee discussed the terms of a new administrative International Sugar Agreement but did not debate the most controversial area of budget contributions  delegates said. Progress was made in a number of technical areas  but with one of the main importers  the Soviet Union  unable to attend because of prior commitments  the distribution of votes and contributions was not raised  an ISO spokesman said. Delegates said private meetings are also taking place between the main participants to discuss the details of the new agreement. The committee is due to meet again tomorrow."
"2","Roy Denman  the European Communityrepresentative in Washington  warned the United States against setting a rule that trading partners running a surplus should be  beaten over the head  for not removing trade barriers. Denman  in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post  said trade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations  either bilaterally or multilaterally  through the Geneva-based United Nations agency  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT. Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debate this week on a major trade bill.  It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners running a surplus with the United States should be beaten over the head if trade barriers objected to by the United States are not removed within a certain time-scale   said Denman in an apparent reference to some of the measures in the congressional trade bill.  If we turn to the path of unilateral action  retaliation and counter-retaliation  the one-world (GATT) trading system will very quickly unravel   he said. Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was not purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.  The trade deficit results from a combination of macroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit)  the exchange rate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry   Denman said. He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfair trade prctices. He said the European Community had recently updated a list of some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.  We did not circulate this list with any hostile or aggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight   Denman said."
"2","Bonn is expected to rush throughlegislation this month creating special credits to protect West German farmers from a proposed European Community  EC  payments freeze  government sources said. The new measures are apparently designed to shield West German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC executive commission's farm policy reform plans  political sources said. EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over future farm financing. West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing imports of vegetable oil and fats  for fear of U.S. retaliation. Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports. The draft legislation  which the ruling centre-right coalition will present to parliament tomorrow  would provide temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels. The Commission  facing a five billion European Currency Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the year  has threatened to start phasing out payment of some subsidies and premiums from August  unless EC member states take urgent measures to provide fresh funds. West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to a farm price package for 1986/87. Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies by creating a buffer for West German farmers. The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1  ahead of the summer recess  SPD sources said. SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party would support the bill  even though it would further swell massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill was an admission that the government believes the farm price talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy. According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters  government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1 billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and premiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer. The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually. But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks (55 mln dlrs) in interest payments  farm policy sources said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the bill when it meets tomorrow."
"2","The European Community (EC) executiveCommission will today urgently consider whether to take a new initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis. The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in Luxembourg Monday. Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for 1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were first announced in March. The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted into member state currencies. West German delegation sources  who have opposed both plans fiercely  said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax plan and modified the currency proposals  there would be a chance of agreement on other aspects of the package. These include measures to cut the effective price paid to farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct. But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would include plans for revising the current oils and fats and currency regulations. The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at the end of the month. Commission president Jacques Delors  who wants to ensure the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means of financing the cash-strapped EC  said yesterday it would be  disastrous  if farm issues had to be discussed by government leaders. However  with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75 billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year  the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the traditionally free-spending farm ministers  diplomats said Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens  who chaired yesterday's joint meeting of ministers  said afterwards some aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to be referred to the summit. Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as useful in clarifying the issues  some diplomats said it seemed to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions. Indeed  they said an extra state  Spain  seemed to have lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and fats tax  West Germany  Britain  Denmark and Portugal."
"2","The Venice summit accord gives theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility in smoothing vital economic cooperation between industrial countries  a senior IMF official said. The official  who met reporters but asked not to be identified  made clear that the use of a series of economic measurements to monitor the seven leading industrial democracies would be difficult but was a major step in cooperation. The United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of economic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an attempt to increase cooperation on economic policy. The setting of a formal process of review  while seen as a step forward in the cooperative effort  was also criticised because it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic behaviour that hurt other countries. But the official said influences and peer pressure could have a major impact in reforming an erring country. Economists generally believe a cooperative economic approach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact on the global economy  including helping the poorest debtor countries. The official said the IMF function would be to warn countries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and try to persuade them to modify it.  I hope it will be a yellow light  not a red flag   he said. He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the next few weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility  which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries. The facility  approved about 15 months ago  is currently financed at about 3.8 billion dlrs  but this would be tripled under the plan. He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very difficult  with countries pressing each other to do more and finding reasons to reduce their own exposure.  They will be tremendously difficult negotiations   he said."
"2","Foreign Ministers of the Associationof South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) said they expect closer economic ties with Japan. A communique issued at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting said Asean hoped for greater Japanese investment in the region  better access for Asean products in the Japanese market and larger numbers of visiting Japanese tourists. The ministers are due to start four days of talks tomorrow with officials of the U.S.  Japan  the European Community  New Zealand  Australia and Canada  including Secretary of State George Shultz and Japan's Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari. The Asean communique noted Japan's large trade surplus  which it said would enable Tokyo to play a greater role in the economic development of ASEAN and in facilitating closer ASEAN economic cooperation.  Japan could also help to facilitate the flow of Japanese investments to ASEAN through the provision of attractive financial assistance and incentives for its private sector   it said. The communique also welcomed President Reagan's firm action in vetoing trade protectionist measures in the Congress. The communique said the ASEAN ministers were concerned over the proliferation of protectionist policies  pressures and measures in developed countries  the continued depressed level of commodity prices  the instability of exchange rates and the lack of a comprehensive solution to the world debt situation."
"2","OPEC has regained its former role asprice-setter in the oil market following last year's price war  acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said. But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand for OPEC oil  adding that market stability will mean a continued sacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries. Al-Chalabi  speaking at a university here yesterday  said the December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr per barrel reference price gave the market a signal that the producers' group was serious.  It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and this has restored its credibility   said al-Chalabi  who is in Caracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors. Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded the production quotas which took effect on February 1 and spot market prices are now near or above official OPEC prices. Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basic dilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role  he said.  The question was  what should OPEC do? Defend the price and risk losing its market share? Or defend its market share and let the price drop?  he asked.  OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question is how long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?  he said. Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up prices and achieving discipline regarding quotas  he saw no quick end to restraint in production. He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil because increased non-OPEC production  combined with conservation and the use of alternative energy sources  has caused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed."

"2","The EC Commission has proposed amodified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fats in its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals  an official document detailing the proposals shows. The document  made available to journalists  says the commission proposes that the tax should start at levels originally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1. However  the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50 pct from originally envisaged levels  the document said. In addition  the Commission proposes that the level of the tax  expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne  could be reviewed every three months rather than annually. Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals for fish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections to the tax from Portugal and Spain  major fishing nations. Other countries opposing the tax include Britain  West Germany and Denmark. The new proposals retain most of the Commission's original plans in other sectors. However  they mark the Commission's recognition that it cannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention for cereals  diplomats said. Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthly increments applied to cereals during the November to May period when intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheat and two Ecus a tonne for other cereals. The document shows the Commission has also changed its green currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition  notably from West Germany. West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points  with a further one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season. The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantling of positive MCAs. For other countries  the Commission makes the following proposals for dismantling negative MCAs Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points for animal products and just over two points for crops. France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for an extra 1.5 point cut for beef. Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created since January 12. Britain - five point cut for most products  6.5 points for beef. Greece  Spain and Portugal - for most products  dismantling of seven  14 and 5.5 points respectively."
"2","Secretary of State George Shultz saidthe U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster than many predicted  and the consequences for its trade partners might be traumatic.  The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in order to service our growing foreign debt   he told a conference attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.  In my view  this will happen more rapidly than many observers now predict.   The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is becoming less effective   Shultz said.  It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit  which we all decry  has been in a sense the place into which everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone.   The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit  so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience   he added.  While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies  you must act too   Shultz said.  I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider   he told the group  which included representatives from Australia  Canada  Japan  New Zealand and the European Community."
"2","European Community farm ministersplunged the bloc into a crisis today by ending a marathon negotiation on 1987/88 farm prices without agreement. Their chairman  Belgian Paul de Keersmaeker  told a press conference this morning ministers gave a majority vote in favour of all aspects of an EC Commission compromise proposal introduced on Tuesday. However  the minority against the crucial plan for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats was big enough to block its adoption  and British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor said other aspects of the proposals are likely to be vetoed. MacGregor said the meeting foundered in part because of an implicit indication from the West Germans that they were prepared to veto two other aspects of the package  the future monetary compensatory amounts system and proposals directly connected with common prices. De Keersmaeker said he will now consider when ministers should be called for further talks  but diplomats said the outcome of the meeting makes it almost certain the major outstanding issues will be referred to EC heads of government who hold a summit meeting on June 29 and 30 in Brussels. A Commission official said the Commission will work out stopgap measures which it will bring in on July 1 if the deadlock persists. These will concern products such as cereals  colza  sugar  beef and milk  for which there would otherwise be no legal EC regulations from that date. Trade sources expect these will include a seven pct cut in guaranteed prices for most cereals. The official said the measures  will take into account the situation in the market  but also the EC's severe budgetary situation.  The Commission was expecting an EC budget deficit this year of almost six billion dlrs even before it presented its compromise  which would have cost almost one billion more. It estimates the oils and fats tax would bring in 2.3 billion dlrs in a full year. Diplomats said Britain  West Germany and the Netherlands maintained their opposition to the tax despite Commission attempts to persuade them it would not unfairly hit exports from countries outside the EC. They added Denmark did not formally state its final position but was understood to remain against."

They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April. Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC  the Sharp spokesman said. Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5 000 units a month for the time being. Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year's level of 12 000 to 16 000 units a year. Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade."

State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening EC financial difficulties.

"2","Canada's Foreign Minister Joe Clarksaid there is greater international recognition on the need to reduce government-imposed subsidies on agricultural produce.  There is now recognition that agricultural subsidies must be reduced  and other reform measures pursued   Clark told a conference of ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) foreign ministers and their counterparts from six industrialised countries. A delegate said Clark's call for  halting the subsidy war in the agricultural products  to ensure a stable world trading system received warm support from Japan and Australia. Clark said the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has called for  reduction of direct and indirect subsidies and avoidance of predatory or protectionist trade practices.  The OECD stand was endorsed by the Venice economic summit this month. However  he said he did not expect any quick solution to the subsidy problem. Clark said Canadian farmers  like those of ASEAN   are caught in the cross-fire of an agricultural subsidy war that is not of our making.  Clark said his country will provide 10 mln Canadian dlrs as aid over thu next five years to developing countries of the South Pacific region to finance fisheries and other marine projects.  The new program  which we estimate will cost about two mln Canadian dlrs a year  will be implemented by t&#127;e International Centre for Ocean Development (ICOD) in close cooperation with the major South Pacific regional organisations   he said."
"2","Senator Kent Conrad  D-ND  saidPresident Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by the year 2000 is doomed to failure because the European Community  EC  will not accept it.  It (Reagan plan) is a nonstarter. Its absolutely crystal clear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies   said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe. Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies  he said the U.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy  CAP  principles by seeking a  compromise  agreement with Brussels to jointly reduce production  and apply a two-price system of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan  export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps  said Conrad  a new member of the Senate Agriculture Committee."

"2","European coffee traders and roastersmay propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week  traders and officials told Reuters. Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula  they said it would give Brazil  the world's biggest coffee producer  unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.  The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's attitude  and this compromise could be a solution    one said. However  the European coffee trade federation meeting  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week  has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas. Traders said that  as a whole  the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas  while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close  and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes  with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction  while the Italians were most in favour.  Nevertheless  we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July   one trader said.  We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side  but the producer side will accept it   one official said.  We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year  but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned   he added. Overall  however  trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic  varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.  Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction    he said.  The U.S. Position has  if anything  hardened  while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors   one trader said.  However  with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula  Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated  which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September   the official said."
"2","Some OPEC states are unhappy about theprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week  oil analysts say. They said Nigeria  which holds the OPEC conference presidency  and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely  so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.  All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials   said one analyst with a major oil company.  But at the end of the day  the attitude is going to be  leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.  Iran  Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year  traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and  in some cases  marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts  processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a  package.  Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced  at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December  OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices  but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials  analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes  with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices  with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March  Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline  and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi  chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities  doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna.  It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria  which holds the presidency  raised the issue   he said."

"2","Dutch consumers and food processorswould be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats  Dick de Bruyn  chairman of the commodity board for margarine  fats and oils  MVO  said at the annual meeting. The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC. The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing  de Bruyn said.  A move by these industries to countries outside the EC cannot be ruled out   he added. De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be wide open to fraud  difficult to police  and hugely expensive administratively. He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  the Lome Convention  and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines  but also the EC's own Treaty. The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also have consequences for employment and investment  he added."
"2","The International Monetary Fund saidit has loaned Uganda 92.1 mln dlrs to aid in economic recovery. The fund said 60 mln dlrs of the loan is available through the so-called structural adjustment facility (SAF) over the next three years. The fund said 57.5 mln dlrs will be available immediately under the SAF and a separate financing arrangement. After expanding in the early 1980's  Uganda's economy has suffered setbacks since 1984 of falling industrial and agricultural output and accelerating inflation  the fund said. The current economic downturn has been worsened by the sharp decline in the world price of coffee  Uganda's major export  the fund said."
"2","A spokesman for the EuropeanCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats  saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax. Norbert Tanghe  head of division of the Commission's Directorate General for Agriculture  told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days  the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.  The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable  Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus  he said. In 1990 the Community's  standstill  agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system  he added. Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector  a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced  Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy's oils and fats regime.  The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal   he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT  rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products  and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements  he said. The competitiveness between different oils  whether EC produced or imported  would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax  Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand  he said. It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels  he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals requirements  which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore  more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries  Tanghe added."
"2","The European Parliament threatened toblock European Community spending plans for next year and implied it could also hold up attempts to solve an ever-deepening budget crisis this year. The Parliament voted unanimously in favour of a resolution condemning the annual haggling and compromising between the Community's 12 member states on spending levels.  It is no longer possible to resort to short-term measures or to provisional budgetary solutions. It is no longer possible to accept a budget in which real expenditure is not covered by revenue   the resolution said. Parliamentary blocking could jeopardise efforts to solve a financing crisis over a five billion European Currency Unit (ECU) shortfall for this year  diplomats said. EC ministers are deadlocked on the issue. It also would plunge the EC into an ever-deepening crisis next year. Without parliamentary approval of the 1988 budget  the Community would be forced into emergency measures  with spending set according to the previous year's levels. British conservative parliamentarian Peter Price told reporters that parliament could delay an emergency package until EC ministers prove they are ready to find a long-term solution."
"2","France's leading farmer's union  theFNSEA  said it is worried that negotiations on the 1987/88 farm price package will now be tackled by European Community leaders who do not know the agricultural situation. The leaders have no specialised knowledge of the farm dossier and have the tendency to sign compromises which are  too broad   union leader Raymond Lacombe said. But he added French Farm Minister Francois Guillaume had reason to reject a compromise which would have been negative for the farm sector. EC ministers ended talks this morning having failed to get any agreement on agricultural prices for the 1987/88 farm year  which started on April 1 for certain products. Lacombe said the French government should guarantee farmers' incomes until an agreement is reached."
"2","The European Community (EC) accused theUnited States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee. EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters. Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended  so as to improve its balance of payments. The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue. Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers  pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September. When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas  they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment  known in GATT jargon as  standstill and rollback.  Tran criticised Washington for the  superfund  tax on oil imports  a customs user fee  and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security. Warren Lavorel  a U.S. Trade official  defended the policies  saying they did not violate GATT trade rules. The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee  which oversees the round  to decide any further action on the charges. The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices. The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation. Mexico and Canada  along with the European Community  brought the dispute to the GATT last year."
"2","Commitments to Argentina's externalfinancing program for 1987 and 1988 have reached about 91 pct of the 1.95 billion dlrs in new loans that banks have been asked to provide  Citibank and Argentina said in a joint statement. This percentage is close to the  critical mass  of commitments that the International Monetary Fund has requested as a condition for releasing new loans to the country. Senior Citibank executive William Rhodes said he was encouraged by the banks' response and that telexed commitments continue to arrive. The response of Argentina's 350 foreign bank creditors had been eagerly awaited because the package is the first to be marketed since U.S. banks  led by Citibank  decided to take large second-quarter losses in order to boost their reserves against existing loans to developing countries. Some bankers had feared that banks would refuse to lend new money so soon after taking a  hit  on the old loans  but today's news delivers a decisive rebuff to those skeptics. The strong response to the package was partly the result of the inducement of a 3/8 pct early-participation fee for those banks that agreed to sign up by June 17  bankers said."
"2","Zambia's copper mining industry is hopingto achieve and maintain production at over 500 000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices  deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs  industry officials said. But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability  they said. Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471 000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463 354 tonnes.  We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year  copper production could well be over 500 000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment   a ZCCM official said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt  another strategic income earner  will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4 565 tonnes  911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia  the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns  deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts  fuel and lubricants. The 463 354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700 000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community  the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM  the second largest employer after the government  has said it intends to lay off 20 000 of its 60 000 workforce as part of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were being depleted  Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century  though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied  a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985  ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar. But on May 1  President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system  inspired by the International Monetary Fund  and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.  We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation   Peter Hansen  director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy  told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export profits.  Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar   Frederick Chiluba  leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound  compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments  some 35 000 tonnes a month  are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam  while 5 000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons  spares and fuel."
"2","The Tanzanian government  in itssecond annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery program inspired by the International Monetary Fund  announced increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on government services. Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8  39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide 48.84 billion shillings  leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to be financed through domestic and foreign loans. This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only 3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No figure for the final deficit was avaialble. The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with effect from July 1  to compensate for inflation of more than 30 pct. Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct  with similar increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would rise by 75 pct. The higher levies affect official transactions such as road tolls  vehicle transfers and various licence fees  he added."
"2","A World Bank mission today held talkswith a senior Finance Ministry official to discuss Brazil's requests for loans  ministry officials said. They said Brazil  the bank's biggest customer  was asking for two billion dlrs for the financial year starting in July  including 500 mln dlrs for the energy sector. The mission  headed by Gabin Ran Kankani  head of the Bank's Brazil division  met Finance Ministry secretary Nailson Nobrega. Officials said they had provided the World Bank with information on the economic plan now being drawn up by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira. The government has invited the IMF to come to study the plan next Monday. Bresser Pereira will use the plan as the basis for negotiations with creditors next month in an attempt to reschedule the country's 111 billion dollar debt."

"2","The International Tin Council  ITC intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence. The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the London Metal Exchange over its  ring out  of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985  ITC delegates said. The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. Court does not sit tomorrow. In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law. The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the European Community's legal advisers were due to attend  but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today. Otherwise  the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters  delegates said. The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement. As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation  the Council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies  although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously. At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16."
"2","West German economic growth will slow to1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy. This view is less favourable than the West German government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year  but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct. The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms. The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future. But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand  which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988  below 1986's 3.7 pct. While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988  the OECD said that  the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.  Since the OECD report was compiled  the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986. Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. West Germany's current account surplus  the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration  is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986  before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988."
"2","France's growth rate is expected tostrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half  but unemployment will worsen  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In its semi-annual review of the world economy  the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends  but significantly higher than in the first half of this year. The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987. Activity has slowed  primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment  while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated  the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988. The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986  it added. The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year  a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year  sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct."
"2","Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth  higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. But the OECD  in its half-yearly report  forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct. The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987  but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988. The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices  particularly oil  an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure  the report said. This year  and to a lesser degree in 1988  domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations. Domestic demand pressure  coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness  is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account."
"2","Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987  as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy  the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year  when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct. But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988   thus weakening the international adjustment process.  It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. As a result  the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986  although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs. The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6 000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan. However  OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand  quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through  and thus will provide some stimulus to imports. The OECD outlook said   Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen.  It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth. The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988  below 1986's 2.5 pct growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation  with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year."
"2","Economic growth will remain sluggish inthe Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast. Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year  bringing a rise in the number of jobless  the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct  while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP. While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement   it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit   the OECD said. In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988  with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising.  Employment is forecast to decelerate as well  reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts   the report said. Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988  partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices. Luxembourg's economy  by contrast  will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year."
"2","Strong growth in domestic demand was a keyfeature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986  though the growth is seen slowing this year and next  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. In its semi-annual report  the OECD said Portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption. Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct  but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year. In Spain  buoyant domestic demand  led by fixed investment  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong. The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year  reflecting strong demand  entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness. In Greece  inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather."
"2","High wage settlements in Nordic countriesthreaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In Denmark  the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages. The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark  as well as Norway  Sweden and Finland. Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988  the OECD semi-annual report said. After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986  total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988  while declining in Denmark and Norway. Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth  the OECD said."
"2","The United States should take urgentaction to cut its crippling budget deficit  including possible reductions in non-defense spending  higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The OECD  in its semi-annual review of the world economy  said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit  could seriously affect confidence  both in the United States and elsewhere.  It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987  running until September 30 this year  would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.  The OECD projection  which is based on assumptions of slower growth  higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year  is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars   it said. While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's deficit  much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect. The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last. In contrast to the last two years  more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth. Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher  partly due to the lower dollar  with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.  Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession   the report said. The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year  after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year  it said. In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year  but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year  unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year. Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988."
"2","Prospects for world economic growth remainvery sluggish  and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence  stabilize currencies and encourage investment  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.  The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months  and ... Slow growth  high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist   it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years. The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next  even slower than last year's 2.5 pct growth rate.  We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct   David Henderson  head of the OECD's economics and statistics department  said. The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.  Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.  At the same time  many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable   it said  citing low inflation in most major countries  healthy corporate finances  generally lower interest rates  improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets. But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates  it said  and warned that  for confidence to be restored  it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.  This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada  analysts said. The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence  and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S.  West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries. Henderson said the 6 000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process  though it was too early to estimate its precise impact. He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic demand significantly  quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP. The inflation outlook  while broadly satisfactory  has worsened in recent months  with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986. There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months  with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct  similar to last year. The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers."
"2","Australia's economy should manage modestgrowth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages  it added. The report forecasts a decline in inflation  with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988. The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year  however  the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct. The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand  which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis. The country's GDP  which contracted by 0.6 pct last year  should again show growth over the next two years  rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988."
"2","A meeting of European Community (EC)farm ministers is unlikely to be held next week following the ministers' failure to agree a 1987/88 farm price package yesterday  an EC Commission spokesman said. However  he said he could not rule out such a meeting altogether  noting the decision is one for Belgium  which currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers. The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with the meeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and 30  diplomats noted. The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourg still split on the question of an oils and fats tax and with West Germany saying it would use its veto on two other key aspects of EC Commission proposals  the actual common price changes and a revision of the  green money  system. The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely to appear in the EC's Official Journal within a few days giving notice of the Commission's intention to take emergency measures from July 1 should ministers fail to reach an accord. However  Commission sources said this notice would not detail the measures to be taken  which  they said  might be considered by the Commission at its regular weekly meeting next Wednesday. The Commission published a declaration by EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen made in Luxembourg early yesterday at the end of the agriculture ministers' meeting. In it  Andriessen said there was now a serious threat to the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy. Andriessen added   The Commission...Will take the measures which are necessary  not only for the temporary management of the markets  but also for a healthy finance policy.   This means that the protective measures we are going to apply will necessarily have  in the context of our own powers  a dynamic character   he said."
"2","Proven oil and gas deposits in SaudiArabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output  according to the kingdom's main producing company  Aramco. Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion  the company's annual report said. Aramco  responsible for all Saudi production except about 200 000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.  Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production  as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process  prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs  until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards. Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s. Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304 178 bpd from 316 310  said the report  carried on the official Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.  Aramco's only refinery  at Ras Tannurah  processed 142.44 mln barrels (390 246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530 000 bpd during the year  enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products  the report said. The country's other five  smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation  Petromin -- produced around 750 000 bpd last year.  Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998 707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4 000 tonnes per day  the report said. Aramco said it awarded 1 303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs."
"2","OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukmansaid he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review.  I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm   Lukman  who is also Nigerian oil minister  told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference  which starts June 25.  We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review   Lukman said. The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels  with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable.  I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far   Lukman said. He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.  Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong   he said. He said non-OPEC member Norway  which he visited two weeks ago  had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members. Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength."
"2","Sudan has set aside 781.6 mln dlrs toservice foreign debts in 1987/88  according to budget plans presented to parliament. This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debt repayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debt totalling 10.6 billion dlrs. Finance Minister Beshir Omar  presenting plans to parliament last night  put the budget deficit at 2.88 billion pounds  against 2.85 billion in 1986/87. He said the budget would be the first in a four-year economic recovery plan to be announced by the end of December. Of the total set aside for debt servicing  Omar said 574.6 mln dlrs would go to principal and 207 mln to interest payments. Sudan has an annual debt liability of 900 mln dlrs  Khartoum-based Western experts say. Omar said last March it would be difficult   if not impossible   for Sudan to meet scheduled debt repayments of 4.17 billion dlrs over the next five years. He said last night Sudan was 2.6 billion dlrs in arrears on debt repayments in the first half of this year. The experts say Sudan owes 23 pct of its foreign debt to Western government creditors  32 pct to governments of Eastern bloc and Arab countries and 21 pct to commercial banks  with most of the rest owed to multilateral sources. Sudan  unable to fully service its debts since 1985 and declared ineligible last year by the International Monetary Fund for fresh loans  has been servicing only creditors banned from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears. Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9 billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds. He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans  government deposits and other sources. Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidising sugar and wheat flour prices in 1987/88. He said some of Sudan's Western backers were witholding aid until an agreement with the IMF was reached. Sudan  which owes the IMF 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears  is scheduled to hold fresh talks with the Fund in late July or August on reforming its economy and clearing arrears."
"2","There will be no serious bids at EuropeanCommunity open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package  trade sources said. The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the uncertainty remains. One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon  but the situation will become more serious as time passes. However  traders said there seem to be few buyers around  lessening the disruptive impact of the delay. Poland and South Korea  who are in the market for feed wheat  will be offered intervention grain through special tenders  traders said."
"2","U.S. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting  even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session. They said prices  which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December  have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war  which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman  who is Nigeria's oil minister  said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement  oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point  barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies  prices should begin easing.  OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm   said John Hill  a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher  rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks  including Iran  Algeria and Libya  will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output.  And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel  there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price   said Nauman Barakat  analyst at Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers  such as Saudi Arabia  to block any changes in policy.  The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC  and in particular the Saudis  are committed to stabilizing the market   said Rosario Ilacqua  analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However  some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500 000 barrels to the market each day  said John Lichtblau  president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars  so as the currency declines  producers receive less money for their oil.  The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia   said Sanford Margoshes  analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.  In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting   he said. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.  The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf   said Frank Knuettel  analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag  with naval escorts.  Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this  and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up   Knuettel said."
"2","European coffee roasters and tradershave agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization  ICO  quotas  Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said. Van Horick  who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation  was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil  the world's biggest coffee producer  an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement  van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO  the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement  van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower  consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.  Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to   van Horick said.  The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality   he said.  Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.  Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out  initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia  Kenya  Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas  while others such as the Ivory Coast  El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share  van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply  it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.  If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting  most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula    van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.  Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal  we might just get an agreement   van Horick added."
"2","Malaysia is to urge fellow tinproducing countries to contribute more money towards research into new uses for the metal  Malaysian primary industries minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview. Lim  in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America  said he had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries  ATPC  to draw up a paper on the matter. Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes. He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated  he feared the Commission would revive the idea. Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result  they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports.  Since most of our products are commodity based  I cannot see how this would work out in our case   Lim said. Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year. The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.  Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium  paper and plastics   Lim said. He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application. Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced. He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement  INRA  although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited. Lim  who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's behalf when he visits New York during his current tour  said it was important there should not be a long  interregnum  between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force. He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management."
"2","A U.S. government trade officialresponsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers. Jon Rosenbaum  an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia  said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.  There is one country which evidently still does not   Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil  which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas. Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict. He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials. While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas  head of the Colombian coffee producers federation  who was in Europe  Cardenas left a  positive letter   Rosenbaum said. The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas  but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan. Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders. Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement. The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless  objective criteria  which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits."
"2","International LPG prices were littlechanged in the past week  barely affected by the excitement on the advent of OPEC's mid-year meeting  traders and industry sources said.  If the OPEC decides to increase crude oil production   a traders said   LPG supplies will be up without corresponding rise in demand.  Petrochemical buyers were sidelined  after their foray in the market early in june  they said. An industry meeting in Dublin this week also drew many market participants away from the trading desk  they added. Algeria has moved at least two cargoes of propane to the U.S. Gulf  keeping Mediterranean prices steady  traders said. In the Mideast Gulf  propane appeared easing slightly  after a major U.S. oil company bought propane on formula which netted back about 123 dlrs  cif Mideast Gulf  which was two dlrs below Saudi Arabia's government selling price (gsp)  industry sources said. Delivered propane to Japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs  the traders said."
"2","Argentine President Raul Alfonsinmet for more than an hour with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus  and Argentine economy minister Juan Sourrouille said the two men discussed Argentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package. Sourrouille told reporters that 91.5 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan  which forms the core of the package  has been subscribed. Citibank  the chairman of Argentina's bank advisory committee  said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91 pct. The IMF has said that a  critical mass  of bank commitments is needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlr standby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina. Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass  Sourrouille said   That has not been defined but anywhere over 90 pct we are doing fine.  Although most of the money has been subscribed  officials noted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold 93 pct of its debt. They are worried that it might take a long time to persuade the other banks to join the deal. Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus  who had not met before  mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic situation. Alfonsin  who is beginning a four-day private visit to the U.S.  was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World Affairs Council  a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing public awareness of international affairs. In his speech  Alfonsin said economic integration is the only way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis.  This (economic integration) is probably the most audacious challenge facing Latin America this century  perhaps the most audacious of our history   he said."
"2","venezuela may turn to the internationalmonetary fund for credits as part of the country's overall effort to reestablish financial flows from abroad  finance minister manuel azpurua said today.  this is no secret. It's just one of the steps the executive has begun taking to reestablish financial flows to the country   azpurua told reporters at the finance ministry. He did not specify what types of loans venezuela would seek from the fund or the amounts involved. A technical team from the imf is currently in caracas gathering data for its annual report on the venezuelan economy  the finance minstry said. Members of the mission met today with officials from the ministry's public finance department. Venezuela is one of the few latin american debtors which has not drawn standby or extended fund facilty loans from the imf since the region's financial crisis began in 1982. The country has an imf quota of 1.371 mln sdr's (1.75 billion dollars)  according to the fund's 1986 report."
"2","OPEC has shown itself to be in controlof the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987  oil traders said. They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.  There are light oversupplies now  but OPEC ... Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter  and is in effect putting pressure on end-users   a European crude oil trader said. In Tokyo  one oil analyst said   There's no reason to expect a weak market from now on.  A Japanese oil trader  also based in Tokyo  said   We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly.  Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai  a benchmark crude  they expect price increases over the next few days. August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 17.35 dlrs  above Friday's 17.15-20 range  but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42. Even prices of light Mideast grades  such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes  are expected to improve from recent weak positions  15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least. They said that after initial jumps  they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months. They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October. Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter  they added.  There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high   said an international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less bullish   For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat.  A Singapore trade source said   There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages.  Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level  after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota  was a bearish factor to be considered. Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement. Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions  with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest. Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies  dealers said."
"2","OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs  Far East oil industry sources said.  Fundamentally  the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January   a Japanese refiner said. The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq  the United Arab Emirates  Kuwait and Qatar  demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter. Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade  levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent  traders said. They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.  With WTI at 20  21 or 22 dlrs  U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further   said a Japanese oil trader. Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term  having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.  You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis  there's no reason for prices to go up again today   said one international oil trader in Tokyo.  But I think if there's any sign of a dip  it will be bought back up again pretty quickly   he added. One oil industry analyst concurred   There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on.  He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9. Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices. Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln  they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey  comes onstream in or around September. Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350 000 bpd  against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299 000  by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices  the sources said. Iran  the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases  industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer  cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast. Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels.  Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much   an oil industry analyst said."
"2","Japan will ratify the 1986 InternationalCocoa Agreement (ICCA)  with effect from July 1  and will renew its membership in the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO)  Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said. They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy. The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987. Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue  the officials said."
"2","The acting governor of Saudi Arabia'sstate-owned oil company  Petromin  Jamal Hassan Jawa  has retired at his own request  oil industry sources said. They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi  head of organisation planning in Petromin  would take over as acting governor. Jawa held the post since his predecessor  Abdul-Hadi Taher  left in a major oil industry shake up last December. The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently. The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market. The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources  Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut. Hisham Nazer  who replaced Yamani  successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December. Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business  the sources said. The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz  who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals  and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr  President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals  economist Ali Jonahi  Ahmed Shinawi  and Zuheir Masoud  director of Jeddah Islamic Port."
"2","UAE Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteibaarrived in Alexandria last night for a visit to Egypt  the national Middle East News Agency (MENA) said. It said Oteiba  who had just attended the OPEC ministerial meeting in Vienna  would stay for several days but gave no details. Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support OPEC's moves to boost oil prices. Oil Minister Abdel Hadi Kandeel last week said Egypt plans to leave its oil production of 870 000 barrels per day unchanged for the next five years. Egypt is able to produce up to one mln bpd."
"2","Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback inplanned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year  Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle told Reuters.  We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna   he said.  The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution.  The cuts  originally brought in from February 1  would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament  Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd  and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd  rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter. Norway  which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields  previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840 000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd  and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80 000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien  currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers  has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers  including the Soviet Union  Mexico  China  Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986. But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit. Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production."
"2","IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessuspaid a brief weekend visit to the Ivory Coast during which he discussed the country's economic difficulties with President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Camdessus said he wished his visit could have been in more pleasant circumstances in remarks reported by the official Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin. He added that the extremely steep fall in agricultural commodity markets had dealt a harsh blow this year to the Ivorian economy and because of this the country was experiencing a growth problem and difficulties with its international debt. Last month the Ivory Coast informed its creditors it had to suspend payments on its foreign debt  estimated at more than eight billion dlrs. Camdessus said his agency had to study the problems of the Ivory Coast but a solution depended on a coordinated effort between the country itself  the commercial banks  other governments and international finance institutions. He also disussed problems of developing countries in general with banking and government officials in Abidjan."
"2","The European Investment Bank (EIB)said it has lent 200 mln French francs to French railways Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) to extend its high speed train system. It said in a statement that the loan will help finance the contruction of a 279 km track for high speed  TGV  trains between Paris and Le Mans in western France and Tours in the south west. The loan will also help pay for new trains. The EIB has already lent a total of 600 mln francs to SNCF for the high speed train system in 1985 and 1986."
"2","Belgium  current holder of the EuropeanCommunity presidency  appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price package  diplomats said. In a discussion document prepared for today's summit meeting of EC leaders  Belgium proposed the so-called  stabilising mechanism  be the subject of  further study and consultation with the Community's main trading partners.  The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism. The discussion document  aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price talks  contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure. Britain and Denmark  which assumes the EC presidency on June 30  have led the opposition to the measure. They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and  to a lesser extent  Spain. Although the paper was not universally welcomed  diplomats said  the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting."
"2","Top-level talks last week between theEuropean Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next month  diplomatic sources said. The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market. The sources said the EC  which currently provides subsidies of around 16 cents a pound  offered a compromise in last week's talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S. U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline for agreement  set last August when the two sides resolved a related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports. The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta  lifted when the citrus row was settled. But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10."
"2","European Community agricultureministers will meet tomorrow evening  after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government  to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package  an EC Commission spokesman said. He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord. The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of  dynamic  moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers. These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord  EC sources said. Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action  trade sources said. EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats. In addition  West Germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system. Earlier today  diplomats said Belgium  the current holder of the European Community presidency  appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax."
"2","Canada has threatened to stop importsof Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses  a Danish agriculture ministry official told Reuters. The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the request of the European Commission  which Denmark approached for support. Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende:  Denmark will not accept a ban on Danish meat exports  and I am sure we can reach an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.  Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986  while Canadian exports to the European Community totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs. Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC. But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC regulations.  Canadian officials are very concerned about the trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the EC and bilaterally   she added."
"2","Following are extracts from thecommunique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference here.  The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive results of the agreement signed in December  1986  by which OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18 dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings distributed into national production levels.  The conference noted that all market indicators  including spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC crudes  have been firming up significantly  thus consolidating the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement.   The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the second half of the year and decided that in order to secure continued firm prices in the market  OPEC production during the fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third quarter  I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd)  distributed into the same national production levels as were defined by the above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.   Furthermore  the conference decided to establish a committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices in order to secure price stability around the opec price structure.  Should there be any significant change in market prices  the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the year  which would secure the desired market stability.   The conference reiterated the necessity of member countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December 1986  both in terms of official price  and national production  levels.  For this purpose  the conference decided to establish a committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the terms of the agreement.    Moreover  the conference stressed the necessity of the cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market stability. The conference  therefore  decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April  1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.  The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference.    The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next ordinary meeting.  The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year from October 7  1987.  The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be convened in Vienna on December 9  1987."
"2","Argentine Economy Minister JuanSourrouille left at the weekend for the United States for talks with creditor banks and the IMF aimed at obtaining the release of new loans  the semi-official news agency Telam said. It said Sourrouille would urge the IMF to release a 480 mln dlrs compensatory loan for falling exports as well as the first two tranches of a standby loan  totalling 450 mln dlrs. Release of the funds from the standby loan has been delayed by Argentina's failure to win final approval to a 1.95 billion dlr loan from creditor banks  which was a condition for the IMF disbursement. Banks have pledged 97 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan but the IMF has not yet defined what amount constitutes the  critical mass   which is needed for release of the IMF funds and the funds from creditor banks. The president of Argentina's bank steering committee  William Rhodes of Citibank  said on Friday he thought the loan agreement with Argentina could be signed in August."
"2","The European Community's annualinflation rate fell marginally to 3.2 pct in May from 3.3 pct in April  the EC's statistics office Eurostat said. Prices in the 12-nation bloc rose 0.2 pct in May after 0.6 pct in April. But the annual rate stayed below that of the U.S. For the second month in succession  following the release of figures showing U.S. Inflation of 3.8 pct in both April and May. However  Eurostat said the EC was still beaten by Japan  where prices were provisionally 0.1 pct lower in May than a year earlier."
"2","Talks between the European Community(EC) and the United States have failed to settle a trade dispute over pasta  an EC Commission spokesman said. Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new trade friction unless it was settled soon. Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take an increasing share of the U.S. pasta market. The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound on pasta exports. The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on the question of how much the subsidy should be cut."
"2","Consumer countries should notintervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas  Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.  Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional   Dauster  a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here  told journalists.  When consumers want to get involved  talks are much more difficult.  The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February. Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact  defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries.  We have sacrificed a great deal already   he said.  this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags  we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours."
"2","Ecuador will produce crude oil in excessof its 221 000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year  Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference. Ecuador plans to produce 280 000 bpd in August  rising to 320 000 bpd next January  the minister said.  We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela  Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months   he said. Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year. Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna  when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221 000 bpd from 210 000 was approved.  They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement   he said. Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250 000-260 000 bpd  with 144 000 bpd exported. While its production was down  Venezuela  Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products  Santos said."
"2","A specially convened Franco-Germanmeeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies  diplomats said The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand  his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac  and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community's worst-ever budget crisis.  The Germans clearly do not want to budge   an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting. Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex  green  currrency system  designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies. Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against  along with Britain  Denmark and the Netherlands. EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package  which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow. Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks. The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget. The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group  and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987."
"2","The International Monetary Fund saidit approved a 48 mln dlr loan to assist Ecuador in meeting its foreign exchange needs following the earthquakes that struck in March. The loan  which the IMF provides countries under special circumstances  is equal to 25 pct of Ecuador's quota  or economic standing  in the Fund. The IMF said that according to recent estimates  the earthquakes will hurt the country's balance of payments this year because of the loss of oil revenues due to destruction of part of the oil pipeline."
"2","World oil prices would remain stabledespite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the Gulf  Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday. He described the situation as  extremely tense   but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal. Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd  he told a news conference. Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued. Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were  overproducing in an exaggerated manner  above their assigned quotas  he said. OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd."
"2","Malaysia's national oil company Petronas  has advised the government to raise crude oil output to 540 000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500 000 bpd  a senior company official said.  We have the capacity to produce the amount   Rastam Hadi  Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said. The government will announce its decision on Friday when it unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month to current levels from 420 000 bpd after reviewing the world oil market. In May  Malaysia cut output to 420 000 bpd from 459 000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices."
"2","Oil prices would skyrocket for a time ifconflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz  but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf. But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association  he said   If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off  I believe the world oil supply  given time to adjust  can take care of the situation.   But this is not to say that prices  at least for a short duration  will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation   he declared. Tensions in the Gulf  however  usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices  he added. Assessing future price trends  he said   Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate  but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel.  The upward deviations  however  are likely to be greater than the downward ones.   The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate   he added.  Non-Opec production may still go up  competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand.  Subroto  a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members  said speculation may play havoc with spot prices  but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers. In the medium term  non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s  leaving Opec much stronger  he said."
"2","East and West on Monday decided to goahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Representatives of the U.S.  The Soviet Union  the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor  to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants  but by joining them. Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich  West Germany  and is scheduled for completion by 1990  an IAEA statement said. Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday  known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built. The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation  but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries. Dieter Sigmar  a leading U.S. Fusion researcher  said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years. Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste. While today's nuclear power plants need uranium  mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste  fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium  an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water  according to experts."
"2","A Council meeting of theInternational Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) has been adjourned until Thursday as tomorrow is a Malaysian national holiday  officials of the organisation said. The main issue at the talks  which opened here yesterday  has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the current international pact for the commodity expires on October 22  they said. The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989. Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period. Other issues discussed include ratification of the new accord  the officials said. Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming member countries had ratified the new agreement by the beginning of this month. The meeting is due to end on Thursday."
"2","Australia's Minister for TradeNegotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on reducing the large subsidies which the European Community and United States grant their farmers. Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform the EC Common Agricultural Policy and U.S. Plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction.  I am hopefully optimistic... There is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the USA  the EC and the Cairns Group   he told reporters. Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks on farm subsidies. The group  which includes Australia and Malaysia  advocates free farm trade and says U.S.  European and Japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets. Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in North and South America  the EC and Thailand  and leaves for Indonesia on Wednesday."
"2","European Community (EC) ministersbacked a commission plan for the reform of world farm trade  which is due to be presented to GATT later this month  EC diplomats said. The plan has been drawn up by the EC executive Commission in response to U.S. Calls in GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) for an end to all farm subsidies within the next 10 years. EC foreign ministers agreed that despite reservations by some member states  the plan should be presented to the next meeting of the GATT farm negotiating group in Geneva on October 26  diplomats said."
"2","Indonesia told the oil industry onTuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate  but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto  in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association  said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.  In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry  the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws   Suharto said.  Apart from that  the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry   he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration.  As we all have heard this morning  the President is fully aware of this situation   Subroto said.  The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia  albeit on a selective basis.  Indonesia  one of the 13 members of OPEC  must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade  oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems  including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies  and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly  the President of state oil company Pertamina  has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas  such as when a field is designated commercial  and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical  and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts  even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years.  This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.  Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001  industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective  based on how much capital would be invested."

"2","Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen in the same months last year  with most of the rise coming in soymeal  the Hamburg based publication Oil World said. Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987  up 4.2 pct on the same year-ago period  with the increase in soymeal at seven pct  it said. Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310 000 tonnes in July and 330 000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months following a huge increase in soymeal imports. Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately but went into stocks. With imports again large in September  it estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800 000 tonnes by October 1 from around 130 000 at the same time last year. EC oilmeal demand rose 100 000 tonnes in August from a year earlier  with soymeal up 45 000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed  sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record 5.9 mln tonnes  up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln at that time last year."
"2","Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830 492 bpd in August  according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here. Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output  a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway  not an OPEC member  decided in June to extend the production restraints  enforced since February 1 1987  on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field  which pumped 168 023 bpd in September against 48 195 bpd in August  field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields  which use the Ekofisk pipeline  were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd  operator of the Ula field  said September output rose to 86 727 bpd after dropping to 27 237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall  operated by Amoco Norway A/S  flowed 74 694 bpd last month compared with 69 748 bpd in August  the company said. September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord  which extends into the British North Sea sector  was 611 138 bpd against 552 646 bpd in August  operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which  like Statfjord  extends into the British sector  yielded 15 388 bpd in September  a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month  Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109 670 bpd in September  compared with 100 188 in August. Norsk Hydro  operator of the Oseberg field  said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1 719 bpd last month  down sharply from 16 170 bpd in August. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well  cutting September production to just two days."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month  although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal.  We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway   Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains  and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years  and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However  the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism  Lyng said  The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.   I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.  Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started.  All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us   Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils  he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC. The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz  recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture."
"2","The European Community's farmers'pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the EC Commission. Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes. He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers  who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues. Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers. This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds  peas and beans  but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions. A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC price fixing. However  the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax. Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices."
"2","Britain's highest court has decided theInternational Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC documents in court actions. On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what extent ITC documents  whether circulated or not  are admissible as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days. On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early January  they added. The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988. The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member governments of the tin council. Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the Court of Appeal legal schedule."
"2","The American Soybean Association (ASA)denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation. ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference:  It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.   These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962   he said. The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory. The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free  in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then. The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax. The subsidies  are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell   Adams said. The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint  Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC  which will be considered by the EC Commission in December. U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982  primarily as a result of EC policies  Adams added. Lord Plumb  European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference  said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products."
"2","The United States is prepared to  pull outall the stops  to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  U.S. Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said. Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community's (EC) agricultural support policies  he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association. He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee. The U.S. claims the EC directive  due to come into effect on January 1  threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC. The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime  which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax  Samuels said. Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations   is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected   Samuels said. Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000  proposed at GATT in July   visionary  and  very serious.   The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic. The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform  expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week. The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes  dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies. The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures  as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions  Samuels said. Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then.  We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access   the U.S. Ambassador said. The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal  he added. The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated  while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports  Samuels said. If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation  he added. Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint  the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT."
"2","The International Coffee Organization(ICO) Executive Board is to hold a meeting on November 3/4  its first since export quotas were re-introduced early this month. An ICO spokesman said the session  for the first time under the chairmanship of Bruno Caron of France  will review the market situation and the operation of quotas. On November 5 the six exporters making up the ICO Board of Management of the Promotion Fund will review its program for the 1987/88 year (Oct/Sept) and items left over from 1986/87. On November 2 a six nation working group will consider stock verification in Papua New Guinea."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said the United States will continue its policy of subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is a global agreement to end such subsidies. In an interview with Reuters  Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.  Yes  I'm troubled with that a little bit   he said.  There's no question about it  the longer you feed the calf on the cow  the longer it is to wean it.  In recent months  USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries. Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies  just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy  and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP.  I'm sure there's an end to the expansion  but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we've lost  to keep our products competitive and to let those  particularly the European Community  who  we are convinced  are the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization  that we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to some agreement to put an end to it   he said."
"2","The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group  EC officials said. Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers  Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat  fish and cereals by-products. But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again  the officials said. The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef. Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes  but they were outvoted by the other states  the officials said. Under the deal  Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4 500 tonnes to 34 300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3 000 tonnes to 53 000 tonnes. Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5 000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550 000 tonnes of wheat bran  the officials said. The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership. Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada. Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation. Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports  to improve tariffs for some other farm produce  to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists:  We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough.   We hope that there will be an improvement   he said."
"2","Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers  called for action to help the Spanish maize market  Spanish diplomatic sources said. Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year  they said. They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year. Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases. The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market. They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help. The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the meeting."
"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday  Danish minister Laurits Tornaes told journalists. Acceptance of the scheme  by which farmers would suffer price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms  known in EC jargon as stabilisers  is seen by diplomats as vital if the EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis. Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day meeting of farm ministers  Tornaes said:  It is no longer a question of whether we are to have stabilisers. It is now a question of how we are to implement them.  However  EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism  it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6. This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked to agree a new system of EC financing  ending the bloc's hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable to agree a budget for 1988. Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit. Under the most important stabiliser scheme  EC guaranteed prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln tonnes  a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of producing in a year of favourable weather conditions. Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to hammer out an accord  and Danish diplomatic sources said the meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation. But Tornaes said any thought that success was not ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this stage. EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems were appeals from Southern member states for protection for their small and relatively poor farmers  and calls from France and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission proposals for arable crops. They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states. Meanwhile  the ministers made little progress in agreeing a scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct payments  which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers on them. British minister John MacGregor told journalists : The proposals as they stand have very few friends.  He said a number of countries fear they could simply encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the cash to improve production methods."
"2","Canada will propose at the new round ofinternational trade talks that most trade-distorting farm subsidies be phased out over a five year period  Trade Minister Pat Carney said.  Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a vicious circle which continues to cause problems of overproduction and low commodity prices   Carney told the House of Commons. Carney was outlining the government's new position on the farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). While few details were released  Carney said the government would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial barriers.  Under the Canadian proposal  all countries would have to ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade   a government background paper said.  Furthermore  in assessing the trade impact of programs  credit could be given to countries which effectively control the output of farm products   the papers said."
"2","British foreign secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary resources. British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting in December.  We require numbers as well as words in all the commodity regimes   Howe was quoted as saying. The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for  budgetary stabilisers  under which there would be reductions in guaranteed prices  restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities exceeded certain levels. Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea  although several other EC states back it in outline. Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on the issue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from which it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the system by which it is financed. The sources quoted Howe as saying:  An interim or partial solution covering some elements of the Commission package would be unacceptable to the United Kingdom.  They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same marketing year as the overproduction  rather than resulting in a price adjustment the following year. Howe also said there should be no question of a special fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the dollar. The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with emergency situations. French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists that his country could not accept the idea that there should be no emergency reserve.  The British position has become tougher   he said. Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers  which discussed the future of EC finances  and which took place simultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider the Commission's farm spending proposals. Before his meeting got under way  British agriculture minister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposal to set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes."
"2","Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttersaid on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system. He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este  Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact  signed by two sides two weeks ago  has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts  other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market  they had better get serious about improving the GATT.  The pact with Israel  he said  is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said   increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.  He said   a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity  not only for advanced industrial nations  but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.  Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist  but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said   President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws  and I believe that veto would be sustained."
"2","EC agriculture ministers attackedplans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that cereals output is above standard norms  EC sources said. They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing spending on the cereals regime. The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices or raise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest rises above 155 mln tonnes. The sources said several ministers complained that changing price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage the financial security of farmers. But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security regardless of market circumstances. The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need for some output ceilings. However  the French and Dutch ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of cereal crops  rather than for cereals alone. The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings for individual countries with excess production being paid for from national exchequers  but received no support for this idea. British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he detected more support for his position against the penalties on farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility levies. He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for farmers could help in this direction."
"2","Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid toraise its OPEC quota above 221 000 barrels per day (bpd) because it is a justifiable demand  Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday. He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an earthquake last March.  For this five-month period  Ecuador did not exercise its right to produce 221 000 bpd   he said.  We should recognize Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of justice in that country's petition.  He added however  the quota increase should be gradual to avoid harming the market  he added. Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna."
"2","The European Community is willing tooffer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year  an EC commission spokesman said. He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq. EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones  the spokesman said. Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers. It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year. Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France  Britain  West Germany and Spain  the countries involved in the Airbus project."
