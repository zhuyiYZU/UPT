"1","Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone  alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao  although normal humidity levels have not been restored  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155 221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers  middlemen  exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1 750 to 1 780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1 850 and 1 880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july  Aug/Sept at 1 870  1 875 and 1 880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4 340  4 345 and 4 350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May  June/July at 4 400 and 4 415 dlrs  Aug/Sept at 4 351 to 4 450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4 480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec  Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S.  Covertible currency areas  Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April  785 dlrs for May  753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S.  Argentina  Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2 325 and 2 380 dlrs  June/July at 2 375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July  Aug/Sept at 2 400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec  Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27."

"1","BankAmerica Corp is not underpressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance  banking analysts said. Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering  which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. BankAmerica stock fell this week  along with other banking issues  on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. The stock traded around 12  down 1/8  this afternoon  after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone  BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.  The circumstances at the time will determine what we do   said Arthur Miller  BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications  when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.  I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could   said Lawrence Cohn  analyst with Merrill Lynch  Pierce  Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits  the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer  most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders  noted Daniel Williams  analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter  the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless  BankAmerica  which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans  stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt  and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year  said Joseph Arsenio  analyst with Birr  Wilson and Co. He noted  however  that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt  the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured  similar to way Mexico's debt was  minimizing losses to the creditor banks."

"1","Venezuela and its bank advisorycommittee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February  bankers said. They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms. The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today  the bankers said.  A number of details have still to be finalized  but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place   one senior banker said. The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates  but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987  1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela. The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks  which have been going on intermittently for several months  follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel. And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package  including a 7.7 billion dlr loan  will be signed on March 20. While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental  bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swift deals  banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil."

"1","ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract ahigher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste Management Inc &lt;WNX>  Wall Street arbitrageurs said. Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1 mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.  This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs  maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder   an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer  announced before the opening today  expires March 25.  This is totally by surprise   said Debra Strohmaier  a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready. She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.  I think they will resist it   said Elliott Schlang  analyst at Prescott  Ball and Turben Inc.  Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would.  Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management. Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested. ChemLawn  with about two mln customers  is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers  pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes. Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system. Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed. Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year  and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter. Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice."

The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year (January-December) has been set at 1 001 430 short tons compared with 1 850 000 tons in the 1986 quota year  which was extended three months to December 31.

"1","inflationplan  initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy  is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices  widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis. Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices  fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate. But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.  The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation  at least the economy worked   a leading bank economist said. The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat  with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln."

"1","A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. Januarydurable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of 1987  economists said. With total orders  excluding the volatile defense sector  falling a record 9.9 pct  economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy. But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment.  It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy  said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc.  I'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought.  The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.  It's more expensive to invest than it used to be  so people just aren't doing it as much   Wyss said. Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws  economists said. November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's increased 1.5 pct  revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct. But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform.  The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December   said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.   The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters   said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November  order backlogs rose 0.6 pct  but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct  he said.  It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting  which may quickly translate to a drop in production   Midland Montagu's Maude said. Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of January's report  given that other reports have reflected strength. But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders  compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December. He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments  compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.  Given these numbers  there's no reason for the Fed to tighten   Data Resources' Wyss said.  But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see   he added. Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter.  People aren't talking recession or Fed easing now  but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth."
"1","Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) andDaniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.  Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security  and eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority over the licensing process   Cranston said.  Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to 70 pct   he told reporters.  I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports.  U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities.  By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology  technology that is truly critical  we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports   Cranston said.  We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place   Evans told reporters."

Baglini said that as a result  today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed. He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil  which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt. Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth  which has been targeted at four pct in 1987  Baglini said.

"1","The chairmen and senior Republicanmembers of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991. If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26  1987. The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill)  Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn)  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore). In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years. He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement   The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die.  He added   The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however  the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated.  He added   The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose."

"1","Iran announced tonight that its majoroffensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the Baghdad government. The Iranian news agency IRNA  in a report received in London  said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over. It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had  dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war.  The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq.  The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...   said the statement quoted by IRNA. It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to  come to their senses  and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq. Iran said its forces had  liberated  155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands  townships  rivers and part of a road leading into Basra. The Iranian forces  are in full control of these areas   the statement said. It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed  along with 700 tanks and 1 500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed  250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers."

"1","U.S. bank discount window borrowingsless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25  the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs  with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25  the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day  down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been  acting a bit strangely  for this time of year  noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday  for which he could give no reason  to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float  but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole  he said that float related as of adjustments were  small   adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday  two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However  he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday  45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks  with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday  55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks  with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday  Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period  he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge  almost all of which were at the smallest banks."
"1","American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc  but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor  as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value  thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8  up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting  company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson  according to analysts. Yesterday  Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer  Jeffery Lane  to the added position of president  which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense  contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts  however  disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express  contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year.  I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson   said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than  a very profitable securities firm.  Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash  which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson  and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past.  Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization   said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally.  They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road   said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.  They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future  which goes heavily into the international arena   said Lewis.  ...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way   he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson  its stock might better reflect other assets  such as the travel related services business.  It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company   he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings  up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985."

"1","A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays  administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments  a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)  former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report  which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash  is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates  said the GAO source  depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures  then the net cost of the program would go up. However  if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease  the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded  the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates  will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program   an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program  while USDA remains firmly committed to it."
"1","venezuela is seeking a 'constructive andflexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt  finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say   they are progressing.  Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments  but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today  which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor  azpurua said only   that is good news.  According to banking sources  the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants. Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction  deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988  lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule  and debt capitalization schemes. Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling  and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal  both public sector. He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year  but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year  but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans.  debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed   azpurua said. However  he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments   because circumstances change too quickly.  At the same time  he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt  based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank."

"1","OPEC may be forced to meet before ascheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices  oil industry analysts said.  The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems   said Daniel Yergin  director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.  OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way   said Paul Mlotok  oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.  OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas  fixed prices and set differentials   said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named.  The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again   he added. David T. Mizrahi  editor of Mideast reports  expects OPEC to meet before June  although not immediately. However  he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.  They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil  but in late March and April when demand slackens   Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.  Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.  OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then   said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.  Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production   he told Reuters in a telephone interview."

"1","Liquefied natural gas imports fromAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible  U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi  director-general of Sonatrach  the Algerian state petroleum agency  indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year.  Contract negotiations  filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989   Daniel Tulis  a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers  Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas  a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export  company officials told Reuters. A third  El Paso Gas  a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>  has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible.  On a marginal cost basis  the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment    Frank Spadine  an energy economist with Bankers Trust  said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices  Shearson's Tulis said. In this context  Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production  he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values."
"1","The chairman of the Senate Agriculturesubcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its regulator do not ask for help by then.  We're going to have a bill to markup  I guarantee you  before the Easter recess   Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said. Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11  when Congress is scheduled to break for Easter  Boren said. Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA)  the system's regulator  to quickly make a formal request for aid. Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress  the FCA  as regulator  is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. However  FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action  he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of the three-man FCA board  Marvin Duncan  agreed. But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify aid is needed  it should request help informally.  We all know we need a capital infusion   Boren said. Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing  Brent Beesely  chief executive of the Farm Credit Council representing the system  said that at the end of 1986 the system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years. While he did not ask for government aid  Beesley indicated the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.  A significant number of banks and associations in the most economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer extraordinary losses   Beesley said. Jim Billington  Democratic member of the FCA board  said the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay loans. The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year. FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.  The bondholders have no worry at this time   Billington said. Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation of the system into a centralized national lender  to de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions. But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors. Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent could be developed without Congressional legislation."
"1","Switzerland's economy  combining lowunemployment  financial stability and a large external payments surplus  is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government  it said. The OECD  in its annual report on Switzerland  picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year  but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce  leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct  the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year  against 1.69 in the second half of 1986  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last  reflecting buoyant private consumption  meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But  given Switzerland's large external surplus  there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which  if only in a small way  would contribute to improving international balances   the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year  with a 3.25 pct growth rate  after several years of relative weakness  it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate  but should still outstrip overall GDP  it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987  and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors  it said. As a consequence  growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry  two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc  and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets  could lead to a loss of international market share for both  it said. Particularly for the banks   recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system  which has shown substantial flexibility in the past  is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position   it said."
"1","The U.S. Treasury said it was willingto participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina. The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply. Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.  Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position   the Treassury statement said. In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze  Argentine officials said the country needed  a more serene climate  to carry out structural changes in the economy. But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts  as neighboring Brazil did last week. The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18.  Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program   the statement said. The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze to restrain inflation. The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days. Along with new financing  Argentina reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of the money is loaned in Argentina."

"1","Dow Chemical Co's &lt;DOW> Merrell DowPharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose mother took the drug during pregnancy. The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the drug caused birth defects. Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials involving the drug  10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany. It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were obtained in eight of the trials  one of which included about 1 150 plaintiffs. In two trials  Merrell said  verdicts were in favor of the plaintiffs. In one  it said  the trial judge overruled the jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of this case by the full Court of Appeals. Of the remaining two trials  one ended in a mistrial and in the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict. At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging the drug caused birth defects  said a company spokesman. He said about 300 lawsuits are pending. Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s  and the Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the company decide it wants to reintroduce it."
"1","The U.S. Agriculture Departmentprobably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year  an aide to USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month. But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.  How are you going to stop the tide   he said  referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups."

"1","The Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants  which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial plants in New York and New Hampshire. The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation standards of its own. Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham  Long Island  N.Y.  and Seabrook  N.H.  had refused to take part in evacuation planning  as required under existing NRC rules. They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe evacuation plan  holding up the NRC's authority to issue full power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants. A group of prominent politicians  led by New York Governor Mario Cuomo  charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting the utilties'investments than protecting public safety. An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan. In a statement today announcing its vote  the commission said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency evacuation planning."

Currently a farmer  to be eligible for corn program benefits  must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop. Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits. USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not extend the exemption to all farmers  Lyng's aide said."

"1","The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks  accelerating in recent days  has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels  down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher  prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However  much of that export demand seems to have been met  with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter  so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest  soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks  setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.  Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May  looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow  which would cause March to gain on deferreds)   one CBT crush trader said.  But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered  if not tomorrow  then later in the month   he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal  the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today  dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents  so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level  the trader said. Hopefully  they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand  he added. With futures down  processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans  further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices  down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production  cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation  with little talk of taking temporary down-time  so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins  they added."

"1","Japan has pledged to try to increaseits purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases  the Commerce Department said. U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade. Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases  a Commerce department official said. He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders. The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that  statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers.  It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985  U.S. firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market."

"1","Japanese life insurers  trust banks andcorporations  largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years  are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S.  Britain  France and Hong Kong  fund managers said. After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years  Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments  they said. Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986  Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd  said. Matsumoto  who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy  said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year  but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs  he added. This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets  Matsumoto said.  The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market  first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years   said Eugene Atkinson  managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity  enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk  he added. However  few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay  fund managers said. Institutions  particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders  are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries  but will put in less money  said Shinichi Kobuse  manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities. There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors  but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive  he added. Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations  he added. Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies  which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities  hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S.  But will now invest in Britain  West Germany  France and other countries  Hashimoto said. Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen  the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks  he added. One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds  he said. Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase  said Andrew Sheaf  general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan.  Last week was the busiest week we had   he said. Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms  fund managers said. Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest  but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc  they said. Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability  they added. Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany  particularly as German firms  like their Japanese counterparts  are concerned about the recent dollar fall. Australia also poses some risks due to currency values  they added."

"1","Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris  Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law  which should be approved by parliament on March 3  abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses  they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank  People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates  the sources said. However  it was impossible for them to follow the last cut  to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28  because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy  they said. On Tuesday  the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct  effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau  the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare  the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate  the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds  minus 0.1 percentage points  is the likeliest choice  they added."

"1","Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today  with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However  delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme  delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers  want to have the ball only in their court and it isn t fair   minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1  using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares  with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30  delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo  allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market  Colombia 17 pct  Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct  with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability  using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share  and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share  delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package.  Anything is possible at this phase   even adjournment of the meeting until March or April  one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas  the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result  industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled  so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either  they said."

"1","Britain s ruling Conservatives haveenlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party  according to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday. A Market &amp; Opinion Research International (MORI) poll conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a six point lead  while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead. The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of Greenwich  near London. The MORI poll  conducted in the six days leading up to the by-election  showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote  Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and Liberals with 21 pct. The Sunday Express said its poll  conducted on Friday  found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote  Labour with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct. A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over Labour. In that survey  the Conservatives had the support of 39 pct of the voters  Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct."
"1","Indonesia s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987  against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines  the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia s staple food  rice  is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986  according to the annual report on Indonesia s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes  with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.  Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane  rubber and copra show little or no gain   the report says.  The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans  palm oil and palm kernels.  Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds  limited fertile land  insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops  the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as  wereng  or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties  and to use lower-yielding  more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee  tea  rubber  plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln  with exports rising to an estimated 720 000 tonnes from 695 000 tonnes in 1986  the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980 000 in 1986/87  imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat  soybeans  soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate  the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump."
"1","Kuwait s Oil Minister  in remarkspublished today  said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying:  None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Kuwait  they said  was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.  This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability  it will do so   the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.  If we can sell more than our quota at official prices  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share  it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever   he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar  which industry sources said was selling less than 180 000 bpd of its 285 000 bpd quota  because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered  a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.  Because it was charging its official price  of 16.67 dlrs a barrel  it had lost custom  he said but did not elaborate. However  Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad  he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body s members. Ecuador s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude  and was to seek this at talks this month of opec s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members  in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar  he said:  We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.  But he expected the situation would later improve."
"1","Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy  the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues  the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia  the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer  has been severely hit by last year s fall in world oil prices  which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.  (It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation  both as it pertains to investments and imports   the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia s agricultural sector  but also reviews the country s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation   there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.   This group strongly favours an import substitution economy   the report says. Indonesia s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected  and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May  which broadened areas for foreign investment  reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero  and the economy may even have contracted a bit.  This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s   the report notes. Indonesia  the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million  is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook.  For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.   Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity  real declines in construction and trade  and a reduced level of growth in agriculture   the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform  the Bank said."

"1","The Gulf oil state of Qatar  recoveringslightly from last year's decline in world oil prices  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today  Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals  down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings  social services  health  education  transport and communications  electricity and water  industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar  an OPEC member  has an output ceiling of 285 000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said:  Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends  foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth  have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."
"1","Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade  but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind  &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate  foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.  Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts   he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets  stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.  Nevertheless  bond and stock markets remain  to a large extent  fragmented and lagging behind   he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange  while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf  governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges  Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had  clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.  In addition  family firms are reluctant to go public  financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain  Kuwait  Qatar  Oman  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction  with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is  no bond market to speak of  in Saudi Arabia  Qatar  Oman or the UAE  with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up  establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar  Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent  Azzam said."

The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September  they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system  delegates said.

"1","The U.S. Economy continued to expand inFebruary but at a slower pace than in January  which saw a spurt of activity  the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report. The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January  the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The  NAPM report  based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies  also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. But production remained vigorous  with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month  but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production. The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth straight month  more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices  this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz  chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee  said:  The economy continued to expand in February  but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter.  The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure  based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders  production  vendor deliveries  inventories and employment."

It hasn't been abolished at all   he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and  he hoped  would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector  he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders  and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar."

"1","European Community (EC) agricultureministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers  Community officials said. The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's Brussels Commission  which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses  which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy  demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals  over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil  Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year  an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices  coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms  which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the  green  exchange rate system  which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax  of up to 330 Ecus per tonne  would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds  but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States  which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes  which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line."

Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express's 1.25 billion dlrs net in 1986. American Express remained silent last Thursday and Friday as rumours drove its stock up a total of 5.50 dlrs in two days. It closed Friday at 74."
"1","Indonesia is unlikely to import coprafrom the Philippines in 1987 after importing 30 000 tonnes in 1986  the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said. The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah  an increase in import duties on copra and increases in the price of Philippines copra have reduced the margin between prices in the two countries. Indonesia's copra production is forecast at 1.32 mln tonnes in calendar 1987  up from 1.30 mln tonnes in 1986."

"1","An earthquake measuring 6.5 on theRichter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas  officials and seismologists said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas. The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated. A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16 000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged. No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip. Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes  the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks. The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island. Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week. Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links. Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam  32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina  the largest earth dam in the North Island."

"1","Saudi crude oil output last month fellto an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January  Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week  the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage  which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers  the four ex-partners of Aramco  the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>  Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month  when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100 000 bpd last month  compared to zero in January  while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200 000 bpd each."
"1","Indonesia's palm oil output is expectedto rise and exports to increase  the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector. The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in 1988  up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln in 1985. The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes. A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes  against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.  More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes   the report said. The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax  the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year. Exports are forecast to rise to 720 000 tonnes against 695 000 tonnes in 1986  the report added."
"1","Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoawill continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality  the U.S. Embassy said. The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86. In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags  but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags. The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the  probable  re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation. Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32 378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10 284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50 000 tonnes by 1988. Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35 000 tonnes  as against 38 000 tonnes in 1987. The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35 000 tonnes this year  from 33 000 tonnes in 1986 and 31 000 in 1985. The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans. The report forecasts that in calendar 1987  Indonesia's CTC (crushed  torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants. Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea  the main component of tea bags. Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125 000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123 000 tonnes in 1986. Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95 000 tonnes in 1987 from 85 000 in 1986 and around 90 000 in 1985. The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market."
"1","The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System  banking sources said. The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York authorities. Gordon Macklin  president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington  said he was very optimistic about an early agreement  possibly by the end of this month. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges  and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed. Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading  with Singapore filling a gap when no trading takes place. A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start of three-centre trading to determine investor interest. The Singapore  London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones  but some details still have to be worked out  a senior Singapore bank director said. Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres. But if agreement is reached  Singapore will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong  Toyko and Australia  he said. On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ)  modelled on NASDAQ. At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company  the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd (SNP)  but its turnover has been fairly active  and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon. Market sources expect the next few companies listed will also be government-owned entities  which would have no problem meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon  they said. SNP  previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd  issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times. In SESDAQ trading  SNP shares have advanced from an initial 1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far more than 900 000 shares have traded."

"1","After an onslaught of new paper  fewermark eurobonds issues are expected this week  bankers said. Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.  We want to have a week's pause   one manager said. Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks  including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks  from 3.6 billion in January. The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.  I think the D-mark market is still good  but only if you can give a good coupon   another manager said. But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone  bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday  although prices had recovered from initial lows. Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price  and Iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed  but traded Friday within fees at 98.15  98.50 from its par price. Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues  a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens  traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price  thanks mainly to its shorter maturity  dealers said. The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system  which they say is too inflexible. Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar  but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished.  I don't think the Bundesbank would give that up   one banking analyst said.  I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system   the analyst said  adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues  but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket  he said. For this reason  few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday. Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt  banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon."

Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5 506 billion yen from a projected 5 328 billion this year  NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1 770 billion yen in 1987/88  including 109 billion for research and development  as against a total of 1 600 billion this year. An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January  were the major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.

He said the airline planned to reduce its yen borrowing to 36.4 pct of overall debt by September 1992. It is currently 64.3 pct of overall debt. He said dollar borrowing should rise to 56.2 pct of overall debt in the same period  compared to 15.7 pct now. Other company officials said the state-owned airline had no plans to go private. They said the airline is studying a government proposal for it to merge with Thai Airways Company  the state-owned domestic carrier. A report presented to the conference showed the airline expects passenger sales revenue to be 13 pct higher in 1987 than in 1986. This follows a 20 pct jump in passenger sales revenue in the past four months.

"1","Iraq has secured agreement to deferoutstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan following five months of negotiations with creditor banks. Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world oil prices. Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last September it could not meet the remaining four principal repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs  and missed the first of these for 71.25 mln due on September 29. The 500 mln dlr credit  under the lead management of Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF)  has a five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not deferred. One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of the accord  expected in late March  with the remainder in three more instalments to be made every six months. The remaining three principal instalments - originally due in March 1987  September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be deferred for two years from the due date  banking sources said. The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty interest is being imposed  the sources added. Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one of resignation  with many bankers seeing little alternative for Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs  although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies  particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit  a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank  was signed in October  1985 and is still in a two year grace period. The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing. But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit."

"1","Japanese securities houses will issue newcorporate bonds more quickly  accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1  to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market  securities managers said. Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash  but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues  they said.  Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds  but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds  to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets   a Nikko Securities house bond manager said. Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now  the securities managers said. Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system  in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end  and accept issue requests during the month  they said. Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market  securities managers said. Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April  with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>. The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms  securities sources said. The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds. Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic  they said. The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market  securities house managers said. The finance ministry  commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1  securities managers said. The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now  securities managers said. The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system  more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process  securities sources said. It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system  which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds  and for deregulation of private placements  they said. Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect  the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law  expected in 1988  the sources said."

"1","Japanese importers bought some 95 000tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment  under the semi-annual trade accords  trade sources said. The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne  up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment  but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment. Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium. Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans  including spot buying  may have totalled 240 000 to 250 000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment  down from some 300 000 tonnes the previous year  the sources said. Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240 000 to 250 000 tonnes a year  the sources said. In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers  but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing  they said."

"1","Sweden's Wallenberg group fought backa bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>  one of the companies at the core of their business empire. A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>  in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake  about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option  the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns  share analysts said  making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier  an arms and chemicals group  to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies  Atlas Copco &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>. Since then  the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg  a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon  also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company  the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>. During 1986  the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities."

It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target. Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190 000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270 000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295 000 tonnes in 1985/86. Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980 000 in the current year and 890 000 in 1985/86  the report said. Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988. China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share  while the U.S. Provides the rest  it said.  This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them   it said. Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.  Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds  along with pest and disease problems   the report said."

"1","Japanese banks are expected to giveNigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks  banking sources said.  We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling   said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank. A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt  bankers said. The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans.  The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation   said another Japanese bank official. He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details. Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria  representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions  banking sources said. They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here  the sources added.  Otherwise  our response will be very negative   the senior official said. Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal. Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems. Barclays Bank plc &lt;BCS.L> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem  the banking sources said.

Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines. It was not stated how the union would  seize control.

It said the quota allocation was based on a national tapioca pellet stock of 4.34 mln tonnes surveyed last week  up from 3.05 mln in mid-January."
"1","Mine and industry officials frommost member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96 000 tonnes in the year started March 1  according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports  agreed in January  is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50 000 tonnes from 70 000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan  Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28 526 tonnes  Indonesia 24 516  Thailand 19 000  Bolivia 13 761  Zaire 1 736 and Nigeria 1 461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However  the tonnage allocated to it  7 000 tonnes  is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia  the world's leading producer  said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31 500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3 000 tonnes after exports of 28 500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24 516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24 636. In Bangkok  Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19 000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence  the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles  and income tax exemptions would be permitted  he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production  industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo  Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18 367 tonnes in 1986  up from 17 359 in 1985  Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13 761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9 000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20 000 of the 28 000 workers at the state mining company Comibol  which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines  Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1 461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1 000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106 000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21 000 and 7 000 tonnes respectively during the quota period."

"1","Disagreement over management of &lt;SanMiguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board  investment analysts said. They told Reuters the presence of &lt;United Coconut Planters Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean changes in SMC management  which for decades was controlled by the family of its president  Andres Soriano. Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of San Miguel's stock  after another nominee resigned. The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds six seats on the 15-member SMC board  which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by Eduardo Cojuangco  then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos  and he left the country after Marcos's fall. Before the seizure  Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares  paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit. The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded at 93 pesos today  down from 95.50 at Friday's close. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the objections of some directors associated with Soriano.  I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such   he said.  I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner   Ongpin added. The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. UCPB  however  sought board representation before Sy's appointment  petitioning the PCGG  so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected.  Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. The analysts said Sy  backed by the government  would probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual election is scheduled for May. A UCPB spokesman declined to comment  saying it was up to the PCGG to decide whom to appoint. One analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago.  It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano   he said. SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales of 10.36 billion."

Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>  which currently holds a 50.1 pct  and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities  one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes  obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco  suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people  with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit  which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York  where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day  and in London where it has 15 billion. It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day.

"1","Hungary is to embark on a new series ofausterity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints. But Zoltan Boesze  chief of the Finance Ministry's budget financing division  told Reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided  quite severe  measures were needed.  All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures   he said. Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Boesze said:  The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results  and of course the Fund would support these efforts.  IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year. Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms  which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall  Boesze said. Subsidies to state firms  including grants to maintain low consumer prices  exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986  up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.  I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies   Boesze said.  The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful.  Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities.  I believe these reserves should not be used at all   he said. Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product  which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987  but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. This would mean a severe cut in living standards  as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1. About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies  but that social considerations made this difficult. But he added:  I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.  He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims. Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. Between 100 000 and 150 000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures. Istvan Nagy  a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law  told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. After subsidies to state enterprises  the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986  Boesze said. Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs  according to provisional figures  while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank  mostly from abroad  and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a  very difficult  situation  but not in crisis. There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year  however  and borrowing must be used more effectively.  Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous   Berecz said."

"1","Japanese consumers hesitated about buyingthe controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today  but said the DAT player's near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.  The sound is great  but I'll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100 000 yen before buying one   said Terumi Fujitsuka  35  a steel firm employee. Aiwa  Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks  retailers said. Aiwa's machine  the cheapest  is listed at 188 000 yen. Machines by Sony  Hitachi  Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March  industry sources said. DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines  they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the DAT player's debut  the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.  Nobody can tell the difference   one salesman said. DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese hardware makers  hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition  are eager to carve out a profitable niche. Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly  possibly to around 70 000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market  industry analysts said. They said by 1990  sales could reach six mln units per year. Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year."
"1","Italy's strong economic revival has ledsome observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects  but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.  I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism   says Luigi Spaventa  one of Italy's leading economists and a professor at Rome University. According to Spaventa  these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years  with Italy one minute seen as the  bad boy of Europe  and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration   I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room.  Spaventa  in tune with other economists and industrialists here  stress Italy's recent achievements  particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises  but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.  &lt;FIAT.M> and &lt;ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming  the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses  inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. Only this week  it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States  Japan  West Germany  France and Britain. Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy  economists and industrialists say.  We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy   warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti. He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism  the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. The country's huge state sector deficit  high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems  experts say. The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109 561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100 000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again  says Carlo Scognamiglio  head of the private Luiss university in Rome. Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running at 4.5 pct  but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness  economists and industrialists say. And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last October according to the latest official data. Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in October 1986  almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct  more than double that in the industrial north. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product (GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last year  when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3 717 billion lire  by year end from 23 085 billion lire in 1985. But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations  it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities  economists say. Italy has no controls on insider trading. The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures  economists say.  Even today  if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse  I doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that   says Spaventa."

"1","Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks  held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations  will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus  U.S. Officials said.  We appreciate their frustration   a senior Japanese government official said.  But we are also frustrated.  The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard  forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade  but it will  he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.  It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments   a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance  which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days  the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing  and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government  which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports  as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices.  It condemns Japan without due process   one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen  he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill  particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S.  Officials said. Nevertheless  Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position  especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.  We have no leverage   one official admitted. As a result  Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields  including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers  officials said."

The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings  and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years  Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870 000 pounds  up from 833 000 for the 300 series  and offers an eight pct fuel saving  he said.

"1","The European Community Commission saidit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices. The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint  Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers  forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses  it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs. The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority."

"1","Taiwan plans another round of deep tariffcuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.  A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming  vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development  told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1 700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.  We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially   he said. The United States  Taiwan's main trading partner  has said the island's import tariffs  still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct  were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs  which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas  particularly for shoes  textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord  Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

"1","Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year  chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year  equal to 26 cents per share  adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison  which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals  earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs  partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post  the leading English language newspaper  compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>  itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately  Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish  which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free  with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January  the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The report  based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies  also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. However  production remained vigorous as more than three times as many members reported it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month  but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X> gradually resumed production. An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth month  more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices  this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz  chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc &lt;PBI> said  the economy continued to expand in February  but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter.  The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure  based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders  production  vendor deliveries  inventories and employment."
"1","Brazil would not have suspendedpayments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.  It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't finance a little bit more quickly and easily   Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy. Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds  he replied   Yes  because our country did not receive financing from these agencies.  Asked how long the payment suspension would last  Funaro said  It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side.  Brazil  with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs  stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks. Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans. He said the net transfer was hurting the country's continued growth and capacity to import goods.  Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil   Funaro said. He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see  automatic  official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves  now reported to be below four billion dlrs. Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs. But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions  the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt.  We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment   Funaro said. He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years  leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available. Funaro said U.S officials understand his position  but they don't like it.  Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain  West Germany  France  Switzerland and Italy. Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines."

"1","American Express Co  rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc  said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement  American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week  rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson  but the plan was considered highly unlikely  analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday  as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage  which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however  the need for added capital is puzzling.  (American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to   said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added  previously vacant  post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions  a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts  contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm  however  that the financial services firm  which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year  is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year  Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton  and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage."

"1","Switzerland recorded last year its firstoverall surplus in government finances since 1974  ending with a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs  the Finance Ministry said. The surplus  including cash transactions and long-term investments  contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. All categories of revenues were higher than forecast  and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. Tax receipts  at 25.11 billion  were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast  378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more  the ministry said. The ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. But economic factors  including the low rate of inflation  the weak dollar  falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt  which accounted for the difference between the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln franc overall surplus."

"1","Apple Computer Inc today willannounce the addition of two new machines to its profitable Macintosh line of personal computers  both aimed at the business market. The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new machines  the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II  will be faster and more versatile  but considerably more expensive than earlier models. The Mac SE (SE stands for  system expansion )  which Apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus  goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2 899 to 3 699 dlrs depending on its features. The Mac II  designed to run about four times faster than the Mac Plus  is to be ready for shipping in May and priced between 4 798 and 6 998 dlrs. Mac Plus  which went on the market one year ago  sells for about 2 200 dlrs. Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld Conference in Los Angeles. Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on Friday  especially the high-performance Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations. John Sculley  Apple chairman and chief executive officer  declined to estimate anticipated sales  but he said the Mac SE should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.  I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for most people   he said.  My sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue.  Bruce Lupatkin  senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco  said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well.  Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation   he told Reuters.  The graphics interface on the Mac products is significantly better than anything IBM has to date.  International Business Machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring. The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor  an  open architecture  that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices  a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory  expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor. In a demonstration of its speed and power  company executives said they thought the Mac II would push the development of software for Apple computers in new directions that could include sophisticated video editing  electronic mail systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use. The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray. The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte RAM  expandable to four megabytes  and a nine-inch monochrome screen. Both new computers have two optional keyboards  a new feature in the Apple line of products."

"1","LL and E Royalty Trust said LouisianaLand and Exploration Co &lt;LLX>  the working interest owner for its oil and natural gas properties  is entitled to start placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue to the trust. LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the necessity of doing so.  The trust said  If the working interest owner does begin to escrow funds  the effect on the royalties paid to the trust would be significant.   Royalties from the properties are the trust's only source of income. The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices. It said  however  that oil and natural gas reserves have actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates reflect prices and costs only through September 30. The trust said using the September figures  the engineers determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices received in January 1987  however  it said the estimate would have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has been some weakening in prices since January. The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama and Florida  a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986  as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production costs after expenses of nitrogen injection."

"1","New Jersey-based overnight messengerPurolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid  but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO  a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc  will be majority owner of the company. Hutton said the acquiring company  PC Acquisition Inc  is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition  containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered  shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash  six dlrs in debentures  and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s  at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs  and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division  which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called  bridge  financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans  Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business  its president Warren Idsal said.  Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations  which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future   said Idsal. William Taggart  chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division  will be chief executive officer of the new company. The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions. The offer will begin Thursday  subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended."

"1","The U.S. asset-backed debt securitiesmarket  which grew explosively last year  is broadening and investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.  It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed deals of the year were done by commercial banks   said Anthony Dub  who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group. BankAmerica Corp's &lt;BAC> Bank of America unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the offering sold out quickly  mostly to institutional investors. The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman  Sachs and Co ran the books on that deal  with First Boston acting as co-manager. However  Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called  cars deals  that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.  The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast  the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle   he said. In a grantor trust  investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust  analysts explained. The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A  which the bank established for that single purpose  investment bankers pointed out. The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct  or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life  the deal was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively.  AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal   one said. However  Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies  unlike many of last year's cars deals  which were rated by S and P alone.  Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months   Dub detailed. Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half  the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables  backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables  making it one of the biggest in the U.S.  analysts said. Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into the young asset-backed securities market  analysts noted. In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold  via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A  514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc. Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp  a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc  via First Boston  and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp  a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>  via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.

In that case  Canada decided pasta imports  which take about ten pct of the Canadian market  did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market. Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986  but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated."

The employers' invitation to restart the talks comes on the day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf for a resolution of the dispute expires. De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the sector. No comment was immediately available from the employers' organization."

"1","European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market  which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of  manifest crisis.  But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries  with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead  in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures  they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a  voluntary  basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area  that of hot rolled coils  and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program  particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240 000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes."

"1","Directors of the Chicago MercantileExchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index futures pit  an exchange executive said. The petition calls for elimination of dual trading  a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account. But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called  front-running   where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers. Leo Melamed  CME special counsel  said directors will rule on the petition on Wednesday  but added that a special S and P Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days. In addition to a recommendation on dual trading  Melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit. Melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because  most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations.  CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board accepts the member's petition this week  a rule change will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval. If the board does nothing  or rejects the petition request  a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days  Beyer said. Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made  it will confuse the issue.  Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading. Although Jonathan Wolff  senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette  noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges.  It's a question of the integrity of the person you do business with   Wolff said. Futures traders who act as brokers  however  maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits.  To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors   said John Michael  vice president at First Options of Chicago.  What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved   he said. Furthermore  the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood  he said.  If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running)  or even suspected him of doing it  I would cut him off   Michael said. An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit  for instance  will fill orders for 5 000 to 10 000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract  floor sources said.  Even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative. Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move  but also the risk of losing the brokerage business  Michael said."

"1","The staff of the federal Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on 2.25 billion dlrs of bonds  a WPPSS official told Reuters. WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was selling the bonds. English  in a telephone interview  said the SEC staff planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants  which were to built with the bonds' proceeds. English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made no public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.  We at all times told the public everything we knew about the costs   he said. English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC might meet on the staff's recommendations. The SEC  as a matter of policy  never comments on its enforcement activities. The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and the agency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized on several occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell  the Michigan Democrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC's budget and operations. Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS  one has been completed  two remain under construction  and two others--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- have been terminated."

It will include recording additional trade data  checking  comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply initially to delivery against payment transactions  AIBD said. The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and confirmation systems by September this year. Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a  trade date-plus-one  matching capacity  reporting on a given day on trades entered by 1000 London time  designed to work with a planned AIBD rule requiring the entry of previous day's trades by that time.

"1","OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused oil market manipulators  of drawing down their own stocks and spreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its 15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling  set last December.

People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPEC by drawing down more on their stock than normal  and this is having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the market which we know is not real   Lukman said. Lukman  Nigeria's oil minister  said that despite probable  minor deviations  by one or two member countries   basically OPEC is producing around what it said it would produce.  After OPEC's price and production accord last December  the market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to around 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization was producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February. But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain its discipline  in view of past experience.  We have the experience of what happened in 1986 behind us  when violations of agreements led to the collapse of the market   he said.

The company will not set up its own dealer franchises  but intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation. Lutz commented   We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar.

"1","Ford Motor Co's program to introduceair-bags in its compact cars is facing widespread resistance from both consumers and dealers  a trade paper said.

Ford has projected output of 12 000 Tempo and Topaz models equipped with airbags in the 1987 model year  but Automotive News said the current inventory of unsold cars represents a disastrously high 1-1/2-year supply at current selling rates. Most of Ford's sales of the compact cars equipped with air bags have been made to fleet buyers such as the U.S. government  the paper said  with 11 000 having been sold since they were announced in late 1985.

"1","More than two mln tonnes of surplus maizedotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic headache for the country. The grain  Southern Africa's staple  has been bought by the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it was planted  and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month in storage and interest payments to make the purchases. Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests  the surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly. Some deals have been made with aid donors  such as European countries and Australia  to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique  where the United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the hungry. But transport constraints keep those figures low and the only significant dent was a sale of 250 000 tonnes to South Africa last year. Because of the costs it has incurred  the GMB cannot afford to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been accumulating  economists here said. But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets is damaging Zimbabwe  as it needs foreign exchange to finance imports for other areas of the economy  the economists added.  At present  it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some of the extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for at the weekend will be spent here   a Western aid specialist said.  At least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the situation too badly   he added. Rainfall during the current rainy season has been far below average  ravaging all but the irrigated lands of large commercial farmers. While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year to the GMB  the government also acted late last year to slash maize production and force diversification. Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds  Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viable price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half the amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986  and above that growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs. The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops  such as sorghum  soybeans  groundnuts  tobacco and cotton  the Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February."
"1","U.S. semiconductor manufacturers struggling to stem a river of red ink  are increasingly looking toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for future profits. The market for customized chips - semiconductors designed for a very specific application or product - is expected to expand by 25 to 30 pct this year  compared with only about six pct for the entire integrated circuit industry. Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales of customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year  about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990  however  customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market  about 25 pct of total chip sales. More important for their vendors  because they are not a standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market  and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly. High volume memory chips have become  a perfect commodity market   Robert Brodersen  a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley  told an industry forum.  The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer and another and customers base their buying decisions almost entirely on price   Brodersen said. He predicted that  in the next few years  only a handful of the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese) will produce memory chips  the standard electronic component found in everything from digital watches to computers.  The rest of the industry just won't be involved.  Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference  the chip industry's annual forum for new developments  seemed to support Brodersen's prediction. Of the 116 papers presented at the conference  some 40 pct had Japanese authors  the first time they have outnumberd the United States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the memory category  including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co's attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory (dram) chip  16 times more powerful than anything now available. The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company was International Business Machine Corp's &lt;IBM> four mln bit chip  and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use  not for the open market. The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on the same  well known design standards  so they are easy to copy and inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese conglomerates as Sony Corp &lt;SNE>  NEC Corp  &lt;NIPNY> Matushita and Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics product lines  they also have a guaranteeed internal market for their chips  so they can produce huge amounts at a very low cost per unit. Customized chips  however  are designed for a specific customer  manufactured in small quantities and expensive relative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy  thus making the final product harder to clone as well. Intel Corp &lt;INTC>  the leading manufacturer of the microprocessors that form the brains of most computers  alerted the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips last fall. The company  which just reported a loss for 1986  said it will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips. Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage that the others do not. IBM  which owns a 20 pct stake in Intel  has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15 000 chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those designs and sell them to others. It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer system for designing chips  considered by experts to be one of the most advanced in the world. Intel's success is still not guaranteed  however. Industry analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market item than a customized chip that requires a close working relationship with the customer. Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time  and much lower development costs  will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed."
"1","Continental Illinois Corp settled anadministrative complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission by agreeing to recharacterize 425 mln dlrs previously reported in the second quarter 1984 as a  loss of sale on loans.  Under the settlement  which was announced simultaneously with the filing of the SEC's administrative action  Continental agreed to restate earlier financial reports to single out the 425 mln dlrs as a separate loan loss item instead of lumping it together with another item. The bank holding company said the change does not affect its operating results for 1984. The SEC stressed in the complaint that it was not challenging Continental's reported net loss for the second quarter of 1984. But it said it was misleading for the bank to split the 950 mln dlr loan loss provision in half  attributing 425 mln dlrs of it to the event of sale. The 425 mln dlrs should have been part of a 950 mln dlr billion dlr loan loss provision required by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  the SEC said. Continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs as a loss on sale of loans  the SEC said. It was misleading for the bank to list the 425 mln dlrs as loss on sale  which implied the loss would not have occurred had there not been a sale of distressed loans to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  the SEC said. The bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans  the SEC said. Continental agreed to the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying any violations  the SEC said. But it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to accommodate the SEC's objections and to report to its shareholders a summarized version of the SEC's administrative action against it  the agency said. A Continental official stressed that the settlement in no way will result in any change or restatement of the company's earnings for that period."

In a complaint which was issued simultaneously with the settlement  the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dean Witter  the fourth largest U.S. brokerage house  with failing to report more than one mln dlrs of cash transactions. In its administrative complaint  the SEC stressed that was not charging Dean Witter with taking part in a scheme to launder cash.

We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However  we believe that further study is needed before the department can propose a definitive response to this recommendation   the DOT report said. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied the issue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant. It recommended a ban in August after concluding that tobacco smoke  when confined to an airliner's cabin  posed potential health hazards to cabin crew members  irritated passengers and crew  and created a risk of fires. The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration and distribution of pollutants on various aircraft types. It also called for more study of possible changes in aircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend more time considering whether a ban should be extended to international as well as domestic flights."
"1","American Motors Corp said it will takesteps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified  alternative location  after the weekend breakdown of talks with the United Automobile Workers union on a concessionary contract covering workers at AMC's Wisconsin operations. AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the company will not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at its Kenosha  Wisc.  assembly plant as a result of the talks' failure.  We sincerely regret this outcome  but the responsibility for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining committees   the company said in a statement.  We will  therefore  initiate the actions necessary to place the new Jeep product in an alternative location rather than at Kenosha.  UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regard the collapse of talks as final after the company's  final  proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union bargainers. But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessions package means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose 6 500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha  will not be getting new work  as had been proposed with a new contract.  This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining existing working and bringing new work to existing U.S. operations   AMC said. Asked if the company considered the decision to phase out the Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final  Northard said:  If the union came to us and said they would accept our final proposal  that's another matter.  But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75 had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower labor rates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated a concessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations. AMC  which last week reported its first profitable quarter in two years  said it wanted a contract for the plants with labor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between the UAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S. Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse by driving down AMC's stock price.

"1","The major U.S. Government bond brokersare likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors within the next 18 months  making their direct-dealing screens available to many of those firms that are not now eligible to receive them  said Richard Lacy  Chairman of Exco International Inc. Earlier today  Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ Holdings Corp  one of the largest of the four bond brokers that dominate the business. In a telephone interview  Lacy said  Within 18 months  we think the number of players will be expanded.  Currently  the four major brokers will sell their direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S. Government securities or those that have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer. The U.S. Justice department is looking into whether limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers is a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws. Primary dealers  of which there are now 40  are an elite group of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly from the Fed. But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the brokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as far-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens available to any firm willing to pay for one  he said  it is more likely that a  second tier  will be established. He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from the group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens widely available to any one who wants them. Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major competitors. Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any time soon. In late 1985  transaction fees paid to brokers were cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs. Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that with further increases in transaction volume  fees can be cut without hurting the brokers' profits."
"1","European Community  EC  agricultureministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at high guaranteed EC prices  diplomats said. The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations. The accord  which is due to operate from the start of the new milk marketing year on April 1  was hailed as the most significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses. Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened if the proposals are altered too radically. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into public stores when market prices and stocks are high. Faced with a butter  mountain  of a record 1.2 mln tonnes costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store  EC farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged to cut production to meet demand. He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales to other sectors such as cereals."

The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop  worry over Brazil's export availability  and increasing Soviet demand  analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery  and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes.

"1","The New York Mercantile Exchange setApril one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one  NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate  after the exchange closes  a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market  according to an exchange spokeswoman.  This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world   said said Thomas McKiernan  McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices  McKiernan explained. The expanded program  will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does   said Frank Capozza  secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change  which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX  is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures  according to traders and analysts. Currently  at least one trader in this transaction  called an exchange for physical or EFP  must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement  neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day  according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December  NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden  said   Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for  in effect  24-hour trading.

"1","A bidding war for Viacom InternationalInc  one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies  pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc  a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal  a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week.  It would take 20 days from the day we mail   said the source. The source predicted National Amusements  controlled by investor Sumner Redstone  would need  half a year  to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan  he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation.  We think we're at the end now  in terms of bidding   said the firm's arbitrageur  who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock  convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash  a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs  and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings  representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash  exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group  led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes  were offering high prices.  Redstone really wants to own the company   one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>  which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year  inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share  dipped to nine dlrs  and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week  Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>  which owns a stake in Warner  rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4. Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>. The company has 940 000 cable television subscribers  operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films and other programs for television."

"1","Canada's decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence  a public policy study group said  It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period  when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world   the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries  the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks  with a deadline of October for an agreement  are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said  in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement  fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.  But at the same time  it added  Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks  Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking  insurance  telecommunications  and the so-called  cultural industries  - publishing  broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation   acid rain  and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage."

We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base   Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company  ICI Pharma  which  with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit  it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said   Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not.  ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs  which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990  ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.  The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return   said A.W. Clements  finance director of ICI  who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline  expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually  were Statil  a treatment for diabetic complications  Zoladex  a treatment for advanced prostate cancer  and Carwin  a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex  both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>  is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs  but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints  which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions  the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as  too expensive.  Henderson said that in his new role of chairman  effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire  the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses."

"1","Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said hehas had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened  1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders  including the biggest investor  the Bass family of Texas. However  the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer  he said. Pesch  in an interview with Reuters  said based on the conversations he held with shareholders  he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said  however  there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc  the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today  Wedge Group  which has a 5.5 pct stake  said it held discussions with Pesch  American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge  in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be  highly desirable and appropriate at this time.   That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share   said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort  in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash  four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical  but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg  an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical  and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch  who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year  continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt  and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm  another cause for concern to Wall Street. However  Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson  Lufkin  and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.  I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed  provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment   Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts  compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer.  I think it's much more doable   he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs."
"1","Marvin Warner and two fellow officersof the former Home State Savings Bank were convicted on charges connected with the collapse of Home State. Warner  the owner of Home State  was found guilty of six counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home State money without authorization from the board of directors -- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985 collapse.

There had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming  but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued.

Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share. analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday. Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser  Dillon  Read and Co since late December  a Hutton spokesman said. Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares. If all shares are tendered  shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash  six dlrs in debentures  and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S. courier operation.

"1","Kidder  Peabody Mortgage Assets TrustFive  a unit of Kidder  Peabody and Co Inc  is offering 500 mln dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes  including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches. Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR  with an 11 pct cap. Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs  this floating-rate class contains a so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture possible lost interest  according to Kidder Peabody. For instance  if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the 11 pct cap  investors would be paid back  dollar for dollar  the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did not carry a maximum interest rate  a Kidder officer said. Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12. The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60 basis points over three-month LIBOR  with a 13 pct cap. This tranche does not have a catch-up provision  the Kidder officer said. The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of 1.8097 times three-month LIBOR. Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs  the balance of the 500 mln dlr issue  range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct  or 90 to 160 basis points over comparable Treasuries.

"1","French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year  the same rate as last year  unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988  from its present 10.9 pct  it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was  increasingly ill-adapted to demand  selling goods at  uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.   France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months   it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986  it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to  a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.  This could result in further major losses of market share  particularly in the non-OECD area  which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports  it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved  the authorities would have  little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre  even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly   it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands  contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next  the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year  the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987  and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices  caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.  We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises  and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost   one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report  indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct  against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year  with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area  the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival  West Germany  could fall to just one pct this year  it said. On the other hand  the report noted  consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.  For the disinflationary process to continue   and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability  it is essential that wage restraint continue   it said."

"1","The federal Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp  attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said. During the takeeover attempt  a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc  a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition  a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies  and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally  Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE  according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys  who asked not to be identified  said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation  as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE  since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America  had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe. The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers. A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.

To the best of our knowledge  Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation  in connection with the TRE bid  he said.

"1","Contracting for future constructionwork declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of 236.1 billion dlrs  a report on the industry said. The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding construction was largely responsible for the month's setback from December's higher level. Residential building eased three pct in January  while contracts for commercial  industrial and institutional buildings rebounded slightly  according to the report. Nonbuilding construction  which soared to an annualized rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only major electric power plant was started  fell back 10 pct to 43.1 billion. Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction advanced five pct in January. However  available funding for 1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending authority. Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional structures  such as schools and health facilities  was the reason for the gain  the report said.

"1","European Community (EC) farm ministerswere fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. Meanwhile  protests from angry European farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food production appeared to be gathering strength. In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from Brussels. The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of Malaga  citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at EC duties. Towards the end of last week  about 10 000 angry West German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed EC prices. In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review  at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies  Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas. Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. That decision  agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations  was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive  but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores  but the Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package. Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem  and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this year of some 5.7 billion dlrs."

Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct  equal to the record level marked in April  August  September and December last year. January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries  particularly in export-related firms  due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar  officials said. Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380 000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry  down 190 000 from a year earlier  and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders  down 170 000."

"1","The government's industry aid andprotection review body  the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC)  will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry  Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said. The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature  duration and extent of any aid  he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30  1989  when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.  The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes   he said.  The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry  as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time   he said. Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season. The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage  Handling and Transport  Kerin said. He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry."

"1","Earthquakes and aftershocks are stillshaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3 000 people homeless. Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT). No casualties have been reported and no further major damage  civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km  the seismologist added. A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force  with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe  Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted. Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale. The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks  declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared  with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired. Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference of foreign ministers. A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when the buildings are declared safe."

"1","Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices  and on calculations gilt prices will firm  bond managers said. Japanese  British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains  including city and trust banks  which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market  they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger  the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand  major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year  traders said. These investors  who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases  appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo  a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today  up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However  gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates  they said.  The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds  suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here   said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki.

"1","Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record  senior economists  including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan  said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.  There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment   said Takashi Kiuchi  senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government  which published the January unemployment figures today  did not make any predictions.  At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year  but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving   a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries  such as cars and textiles  have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring  economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down  said Koichi Tsukihara  Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However  other economists disagreed  saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations  methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare  economists warned.  The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used   one economist said. More than half of January's 170 000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24  Sumitomo's Tsukihara said."

"1","Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea  Hong Kong and Singapore  a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period  it said. Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end. Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year. The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985  official figures show. Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986  the same figures show. Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner  after electrical and electronic products. Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 6.2 billion in 1985.

The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress. Wallis  who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting  made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito. Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one  rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country. He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three  the spokesman said. Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy."
"1","The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade  but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate  but those without it will not automatically be denied licences  he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers  who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said   If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company  it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure.  MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987  spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move.  As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices  there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money   a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said."

"1","Thailand's improving economy will likelycause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February  private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat  chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank Ltd>  said Thailand's strong export performance  its relatively high interest rates  foreign participation in its stock market  and growing foreign investment  especially from Japan  contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year  bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987  up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached. Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold  special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports."

"1","Singapore's Finance Minister RichardHu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1  bankers and economists told Reuters. They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986  indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985  the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct  and income tax was reduced by the same margin. Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme  the Central Provident Fund (CPF)  to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.  I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving   said Clemente Escano  vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The government's economic report for calendar 1986  issued last week  said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce  financial  and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. The sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87  but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure  helped by the wage-freeze policy. Anthony K.P. Lee  vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express Bank Ltd  said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. Lee said   It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support.  Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction  so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget  economists said. The economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further decline is expected in 1987. But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988  so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts.

"1","Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said stronginternational growth had been the main feature of the group's 1986 progress  with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50 pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period. The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme  a larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of its Intal anti-asthma drug  which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct. The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985. The result was in line with market forecasts  but its shares nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from 643p. Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral  as well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products  was clearly indicated by a strong 1986 performance. The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full programme of capital investment. Action to protect the group against foreign currency movements resulted in a small net gain to profits."
"1","The Philippines must devalue the peso ifit wants its exports to remain competitive  Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.  The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive   Monsod said an interview.  No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan  South Korea  West Germany  Japan  all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.  The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance.  If the dollar rate goes higher  our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher  so the financing is very difficult   she said.  But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.  She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.  I'm just saying  keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.  Monsod said   The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing.  Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984."

"1","The Federation of Bankers' Associations ofJapan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo. The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available  the proposal said. It should provide currency and interest rate futures  and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. To make this possible  the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit  three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets. Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles  the sources said. Japan's only current financial futures market  in yen bonds  began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985. But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April."

"1","Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks toconduct securities business here  a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down  financial analysts said. But the timing of the approval remains uncertain  due to conflicting domestic interests. J.P.Morgan and Co &lt;JPM>  Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT>  Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp &lt;CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan  U.S. Bank officials said.  There is no reason for extended delay of approval   one official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months. To date  Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries  this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market. But if U.S. Banks win approval  Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status  since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the U.S. Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment. U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months. Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June. At the last round of financial negotiations in September  U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging. Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers  including two Japanese brokerages  last December. They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S. Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the U.S. Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984  but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses. Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests  but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields. Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan. The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market."

"1","Early dollar straight eurobond trade wasquiet with currency sectors  particularly eurosterling  continuing to perform strongly  closely reflecting current trading patterns on the foreign exchanges  dealers said. Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily  bolstered by the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals. The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January. The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be weak  placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading impetus  one dollar straight trader said.  It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how anybody is going to make any money   he said. Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of the domestic equity markets. Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point. However  some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels. Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany. There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week. FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian -- banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.  (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis after things had more or less quietened down following the first shock statements last week   one FRN specialist said. Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight secondary market  two new dollar issues were the only early features on the primary market. These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4 pct. The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 -- for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct  with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager. Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due mainly to a lack of fresh  good name paper in the market."

No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project  due for completion in 1988  is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market  mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast  and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz  additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline  an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz  Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project  he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product  he added."

"1","Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its returnto profit reflected reduced costs  improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final  dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity  though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>  permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs  it said.

"1","CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected topay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1  making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985  against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1  dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id. The company operates on a substituted tax year  not the fiscal year ending June 30  and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings  CRA said in a statement. Consequently  it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout  it said. Despite the higher net earnings  CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry  with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years  it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty  while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry  CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined  with supply and demand in better balance  but overcapacity continues  CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings  CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985  it said. Lead  zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985  CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln  while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions  CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level  being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow  coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances  enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax  included in the net interest cost."

"1","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that  since bilateral trade began in 1972  China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all  mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that  if China wants to obtain GSP status  it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  for which it applied in July 1986  and  not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.  The official said China was well aware of the laws  some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's  but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years  which the U.S. Side won  he said. But  for the first time  China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods  which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case  he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.  China has the potential to disrupt world markets  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT   the diplomat said. Poland  Czechoslovakia  Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT.  The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type   Shultz said.  China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation   he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs  especially for exports  and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month  China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with  guidance planning  and economic levers. The diplomat said that  to join GATT  China had much to do."
"1","The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday  as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks  money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact  from which funds will be credited on Thursday  when an earlier pact expires  draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday  because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday  and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic  making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week  and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.  I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little  to say 14 or 15 billion marks   one dealer said.  They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer   he added. An earlier pact expires next week  draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank  averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month  just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

"1","Britain's gold and currency reservesshowed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February  after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January  the Treasury said. The underlying trend  which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges  is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs  after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month  after 163 mln in January  while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln  a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January  capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs  with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations  but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman  commenting on the reserves figures  said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels. He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting."
"1","Comalco Ltd said its return to profitreflected reduced costs  improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend  delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity  though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington  and port facilities at Portland  Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed."

"1","The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday  as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks  money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact  from which funds will be credited on Thursday  when an earlier pact expires  draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday  because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday  and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic  making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week  and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.  I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little  to say 14 or 15 billion marks   one dealer said.  They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer   he added. An earlier pact expires next week  draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank  averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month  just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

"1","West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems  senior West German banking sources said. The sources  speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg  also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  who met Funaro yesterday. Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt  which totals some 109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening. Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund. However  the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a  rapprochement  with the IMF.  Consultations are the least that can be expected   said one banker. Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982. Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks  holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt  were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks  involving separate discussions with the regions. Such a move would be in Brazil's interest  since European banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions  such as interest capitalisation. The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach  saying:  There must be one committee and one solution.  But he added:  There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account.  German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered.  The menu must become richer   the banker said. Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States  because of their lower exposure. According to Bundesbank data from September last year  West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit."

"1","Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record  senior economists  including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan  said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.  There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment   said Takashi Kiuchi  senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government  which published the January unemployment figures today  did not make any predictions.  At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year  but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving   a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries  such as cars and textiles  have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring  economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down  said Koichi Tsukihara  Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However  other economists disagreed  saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years."

"1","Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices  and on calculations gilt prices will firm  bond managers said. Japanese  British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains  including city and trust banks  which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market  they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger  the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand  major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year  traders said. These investors  who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases  appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo  a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today  up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However  gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates  they said.  The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds  suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here   said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct  against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London."
"1","Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its carproduction could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary. A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's Unterturkheim plant  which makes axles and other components for Daimler cars  has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers. The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur. A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F]  which is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg  said he did not think Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on overtime by its own works councils. A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours. The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was currently around 2 500 a day."
"1","The price of Hongkong and ShanghaiHotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group  stock brokers said. They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau  Evergo's executive director  declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo  was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.  Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel  one of Asia's best known hotels  and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.  It is purely coincidence   he said. But analysts were not so certain  saying that the Evergo group  which has a reputation as a corporate raider  may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family  which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles.  Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family   said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share  though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun  Evergo  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday  China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs."

As a result  the merit raises will not be included in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change affects about 109 000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada.  GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for salaried workers  making pay increases based on merit alone.

"1","Employers and the port union  FNV  areto meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector  but neither side is optimistic  spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks  with both sides largely reiterating their positions.  There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV  and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking   a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman  Jacques Schoufour  accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.  The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all.   If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector  then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month   Schoufour said. The series of strikes  which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks  began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4 000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases  but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest."

"1","The Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.A> group sawimproved performance in almost all sectors during 1986  the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement. Very good progress was made last year  while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come. Earlier  Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg  level with the year earlier period  making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year. Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1  1987. Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2 575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal  though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts  dealers added."
"1","The U.S. index of leading indicatorsfell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain  the Commerce Department said. The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December. The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July  1984  when the index fell 1.7 pct. The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100  and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment. A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline. Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment  they were building permits  manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods  a change in sensitive materials prices  slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance. Four of 10 indicators were positive  including stock prices  new business formation  average work week and money supply. The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation. There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November. The index of coincident indicators  which measures the current economy  fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November. The index of lagging indicators  which measures past economic activity  rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of 0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November."

"1","This morning's sharp decline in coffeeprices  following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization  ICO  quotas  will be short-lived  Dutch roasters said.  The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas  but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again   a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.  The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present  there is a shortage of quality   he said.  Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks   the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction  it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.  There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement   he said.  There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation   de Vries added. With this in mind  and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover  the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb  roasters said."

"1","Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reportedimprovements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices  disposals and currency movements  Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy  aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses  had now been completed  he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on  with strategic acquisitions taking place  from time to time   he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms  however  profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However  it would not add much to profits  with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year  this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend  with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p  approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However  he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation  beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co  which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S.  Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business  considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However  he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss  with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents."

The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation."

"1","The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year  and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit  President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament  Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct  compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985  he added.  But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result  we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year   he said. The price of coffee  Kenya's main source of foreign exchange  fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil  which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel  has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes  coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world  made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history  he added.  This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts  and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development   he said.  It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs   the president added."

"1","Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducingfour information technology systems that will be led by today's highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval. The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme  The New Vision of Kodak.  Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company  Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986.  If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent  that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500   it pointed out. The objective of Kodak's  new vision  communications campaign  it added  is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector. Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today -- -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes). - The Kodak KIMS system 5000  a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both. -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000  an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems. -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500  a microfilm-based  computer-assisted system which can be a starter system. Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988. Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150  14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus  Kodak pointed out  150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity. Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies  including erasable optical disks  high-density magnetic media  fiber optics and even artificial intelligence  is expected to sell in the 700 000 dlr range. Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks  each storing 2.6 gigabytes. Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives  it will sell for about 150 000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year. The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000. It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150 000 dlr range."

The company said lower federal income taxes and lower capital costs prompted the filing. The second stage  Bangor Hydro said  effective when the MPUC makes a final decision  calls for an additional revenue reduction of 712 000 dlrs  or 1.1 pct. Bangor Hydro said  if approved  the cuts would reduce residential base rates by 8.5 pct  with 7.5 pct cut by April 1. The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1. Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some customers' rates."

"1","Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecastearnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities. Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986  it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements. Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets. The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations  mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc."

However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding  it said.

"2","The Tower Commission report  whichsays President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal  just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington  political analysts said.  This is certification of incompetence   private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today.  It's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials.  In one of the most direct criticisms  board chairman John Tower  a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas  told a press conference   The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.  The report  which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government  was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing. The three-member panel made up of Tower  former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie  does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.  We're falling by our own hand   said one Republican political strategist.  What can we say except 'we're sorry  we won't do it again'?  The strategist  who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified  said the report was like  an anvil falling on us.  Hess  with the Brookings Institution public policy study group  said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress  the press and the Washington bureaucracy. The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz  who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president.  They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences   it said. White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism  but the blows were expected in their cases. Regan  expected to resign or be fired shortly  was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid  chaos  in the disclosure process. Casey  who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December  had already resigned for health reasons last month.  This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes   Tower told reporters. While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers  including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation  analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats. The crucial remaining question  they said  is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair. Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November  his personal popularity is still relatively high. A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government  but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider  a Democrat  says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.  In the past  he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public   Schneider said. Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround.  The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met   said the strategist  who requested anonymity.  They have to recognize there is no quick fix.  Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats."
"2","Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilsonsaid he will use temporary authority under the Financial Administration act to borrow an additional 600 mln dlrs in next Thursday's treasury bill auction. In a statement  Wilson said the action would permit the government to proceed with its debt program during a period when there was not sufficient borrowing authority  which is granted by Parliament  to cover the government's needs. Ottawa announced previously it was seeking Parliamentary approval for the additional authority to cover the financing of an increase in the government's foreign reserves."
"2","Quebecor Inc  one of Canada's largestpublishing and printing companies  is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal  probably this fall  president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview. The company  which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue Inc>  will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane  Quebec  Peladeau said.  I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will   he said  adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week. Quebecor  which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs  already publishes three daily newspapers  including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal  the second-largest circulation paper in Canada. A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper  making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America  analysts have said. Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50 000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers. Peladeau  who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor  said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture. He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.  It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term   Peladeau said. Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue  which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct.  In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper   Peladeau said.  When I lived that  I said to myself...next time we'll be ready.  Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint capacity however  is already committed to other buyers. Quebecor uses about 100 000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell's company  which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper  uses about 200 000 tonnes. Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine  49 pct owned by the New York Times  (NYT.A)  adding to Donohue's 540 000 metric tonne capacity this fall  the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos  Quebec  or build another mill to meet their demands . He said a new mill  which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper  would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane  a depressed area with high unemployment  would be heavily subsidized by the government. Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell's company  either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S.  where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. He said Maxwell's sons  who are French citizens  would provide an entree into the French market  where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S. Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers  with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S.  and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada  Peladeau said. He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing."
"2","The Tower Commission's scathingcomments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure  but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November. But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger  who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it  had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.  Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or  if they could not in conscience do that  to so inform the president   the report said after a three-month probe.  Instead  they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.  The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan  a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and  perhaps more importantly  Reagan's wife Nancy.  More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory  he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser   said the report. Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission's findings next week. With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office  the report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole  a key Reagan ally  told reporters the report disclosed  colossal blunders  and said people who had not served the president well should step aside  but he did not specify who should go.  It would seem to me that if you don't protect the president  you don't serve the president well  then you should move on   the Kansas Republican  a likely presidential candidate next year  said. One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future."
"2","The U.S. Agriculture Department is notactively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP)  senior USDA officials said. However  grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made  though not in the very near future.  The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again   an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.  But there just isn't much talk about it  informally or formally.  Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets  even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow  it could take several months.  I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process   the aide to Lyng said.  An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight   said one former USDA official  who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress  a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday  House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group  comprised of subcabinet-level officials  has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP  officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week  the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of  calm  basic  factual economics.  Another USDA official said there was  not even an informal suggestion or hint  that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair."
"2","Latest Federal Reserve data suggest thatthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago  money market economists said.  The numbers were a little disappointing  but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed   said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy  has been unchanged up to today.  Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar  many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data  which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year  economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs  economists said.  The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday   said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago.  But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.   The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had  it would have missed its (reserve) projections   added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window  which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week  compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole  the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period.  There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday  so I am not too bothered about the borrowings   said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system  economists said.  For the time being  the Fed is following a neutral path  with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct   said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp.  I expect it to continue in that vein.   Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs   added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period  down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week  little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead  economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.  The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy   said First Chicago's Johnson.  Of course  it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak  it won't pull back from easing."
"2","France's right wing government is facinggrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation  budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members  raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year  perhaps in the autumn  to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.  The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago   said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais.  We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.   The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained   he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year  with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation  Edmond Maire  meeting with Chirac today  renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. Calling the government's policies  unbalanced and unjust   he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron  a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group  put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT  the largest of France's unions  declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month  and still rising  government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.  Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that   commented Michel Develle  economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year  partly blamed by the government for higher inflation  had undermined the unions power and popularity  he said. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast  perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.  But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed   he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that  so long as the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year  fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute  INSEE   Marais said. But the second half year should be better  he added. Ironically  one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit  several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down  higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth  they said."
"2","Monetary and credit growth rates inNew Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year  Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said. The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market  Russell said in a statement. The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year  Russell said. Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September. Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.  Available evidence suggests that corporate customers  including non-bank financial institutions  have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market   Russell said."
"2","Domestic demand is now expected to makeno contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87  ending June 30  while net exports will account for all of the overall increase  Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However  he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.  The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower  around 14 billion   he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track  Keating said.  They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time   he said.  On the other hand  net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time  and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.  Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.  Nevertheless  there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane   he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.  The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88   Keating said.  As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further  and given continued effective wage restraint  inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88   he said."
"2","The Philippines will offer its commercialbank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative to cash  the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said   It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.  Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country s 12-bank advisory committee  Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines  debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.  (The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative   Ongpin said.  Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund  the (World) Bank  the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received.   We don t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side   Ongpin said.  We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."
"2","A majority of Americans disapprove ofthe way Ronald Reagan has handled the presidency and one-third believe he should resign  a new poll said. The poll conducted by Newsweek magazine said 53 pct of the respondents gave Reagan a negative performance rating  nearly double his disapproval rating before the Iran/Contra scandal. The magazine said  however  that Reagan remained personally popular. By better than a three-to-one ratio  a majority of those polled said they liked Reagan on a personal level. And Newsweek said 52 per cent of those questioned believed the administration s accomplishments outweighed its failures."
"2","Opposition politicians  businessmenand newspapers criticised India s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees. They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform. But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express  the country s biggest selling paper  said:  The defence cow has never been holier.  The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget  shamelessly political.  It said in a front page commentary the  budget is bad for growth  bad for prices  bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else.  Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them. Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. Reaction in Bombay  India s business capital  was generally unfavourable. Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. Nalin Vissanji  President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange  India s biggest  fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax. Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come."

"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerreiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market  the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices  Nazer said Saudi Arabia  is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.  Nazer  quoted by SPA  said recent pressure on free market prices  may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.  Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord  under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets  which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica  OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman  who is also Nigerian Oil Minister  said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.  We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market  but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions   he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister  Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah  said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing."
"2","Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpinstarts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory committee in New York tomorrow  buoyed by an economy on the mend and political stability one year after President Corazon Aquino took power  central bank officials said. The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs  rescheduled in a 1985 accord  to any new agreement  the officials said. Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the Philippines  despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week  the officials said. Manila  which has not made any principal repayments since 1983  wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue. Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate  which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct. The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7. Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments. One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type accord  which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing to endorse five months after it was signed. In Manila's case  about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks on the advisory committee  while about 180 smaller banks have average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likelyto leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package  political analysts said. They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988.  Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration  which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican   Rei Shiratori  professor of politics at Dokkyo University  told Reuters.  Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax  probably in the summer   Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax  which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax.  There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies   he told a meeting of government and party leaders.  If the party discipline is broken  I would like to see punishment considered.   A proposed sales tax has become a political issue  partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it   Shiratori said.  Moreover  the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging   he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2 500 local elections scheduled for April  involving governors  mayors  town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated  since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP  the political analysts added. Shiratori said   In the worst case  implementation of the sales tax  now scheduled for next January  may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision.  Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct.  A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs   he said. Seizaburo Sato  professor of politics at Tokyo University  thought the last possibility most likely.  I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills   he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House. To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills  the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign  Sato said.  Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed   he said."
"2","Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty  economists  politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88  ending March  is 56.88 billion rupees  down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87  based on wholesale prices  is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday  Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure  he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani  president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party  said Gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy  as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply  may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects  after bad weather last year  may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88  up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes  which will discourage savings  economists said. Avinash Purulkar  chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India  said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said   There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure.  But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene.  Just now there is acute nervousness in the market   he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues  both convertible and non-convertible  rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85."
"2","The Philippines will offer commercialbank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash  the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said   It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.  Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country's 12-bank advisory committee  Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.  (The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative   Ongpin said.  Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund  the (World) Bank  the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received.   We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side   Ongpin said.  We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."
"2","Argentina's chief debt negotiatorsaid he was confident of a prompt accord with international creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.  I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and quick negotiation   Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world financial officials. Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit. Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable  but Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt. He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to meet the targets  adding that the banks' attitude had improved following Brazil's decision. The United States and a group of other industrial nations on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan. Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Michel Camdessus."
"2","A rift has occured among Philippineofficials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement. Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs.  He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted   Monsod said. Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period. Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Monsod said    Right now we are saying to the banks  let's share the financing burden.  Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap. He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis. He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility. Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.  Secretary Monsod and I get along famously   he said.  She talks and I listen but I don't necessarily agree.  Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates  the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years.  If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?  she said  adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.  It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets   Monsod said.  Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day   she said. Monsod  the government's chief economic planner  stressed Manila's policy was growth before debt. She said if the banks refused to lend the new money  the Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing all debt repayments.  If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad  then of course you have an option   Monsod said.  You just don't send it abroad. You do a Brazil."

Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices  Nazer said Saudi Arabia  is fully adhering by the ... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.  Saudi Arabia was a main architect of December pact under which OPEC agreed to cut its total oil output ceiling by 7.25 pct and return to fixed prices of around 18 dollars a barrel."
"2","The French inflation rate is expected toshow a substantial improvement in February after January's very high 0.9 pct monthly rate  Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said. He told a French television interviewer that half of the high January rise  which took year on year inflation that month to three pct  was due to higher oil prices.  Now  taking account of this inflation index  our forecast for price rises this year is two and a half pct   he said. Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target  which the government had initially set at two pct for this year  should not affect wage expectations for this year.  There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy   he said  referring to the government's aim of holding public sector wage increases to three pct this year. Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in 1985."
"2","After a week that left his presidencyshaken and his popularity at a new low  Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal. Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker  whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise  will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon. Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates  a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat  would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote  Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said. Appearing on the NBC News program   Meet the Press   the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination  could be in some difficulty.  Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority by Baker. Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal  lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and  even if won  would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair.  He has the smell of Iran on him   said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt.  He is a victim.  Laxalt  appearing on the ABC News program   This Week With David Brinkley   bluntly admitted  the Gates nomination is in trouble.  Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates. When asked on the syndicated television program   John McLaughlin: One on One   if he thought Gates would be confirmed  the Georgia Democrat shot back:  I wouldn't bet any money on it.  I think this report hurts that   Nunn said.  It indicates that the National Security Council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with Mr. Gates. Only a day after it was issued last week  the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff. Regan  the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years  was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale. The report blamed Regan for the  chaos that descended on the White House  since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two  pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal  have refused to testify. Reagan  who freely admits disliking details  is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership  a record low  and a third believed he should consider resignation. After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower  Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency."
"2","Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks  he said  adding  This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.  The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983  however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S.  Japanese and European banks  Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis   Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors   central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks  followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions  worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain  France  West Germany  Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans  giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus  its chief means of servicing its foreign debt  started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt.  What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service  because we cannot service all that   he said.  I really think we have to change the old rules.  Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments  rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis  Funaro said  We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks  because the banks have some limits.   It is a political discussion from our point of view   he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks  If I've got some solution from the governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks.  He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982.  You must open these mechanisms   he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments  they understood Brazil had no other choice  as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed  because we can't stay as we were the last few years.   I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.  he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy  Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year  against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world  Funaro said  although its share of international trade was only one pct.   The solution is linked with growth  not recession   he said  noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments  as opposed to commercial banks  now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves  a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support. Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. Funaro  accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros  is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy  arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium  because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view.  Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis  describing the meeting as an initial contact. He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request. After travelling this week to France  Germany  Switzerland and Italy  Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks."
"2","Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaroflatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters  Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris  he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago  put Brazil in a very big recession.   We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF   he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks  the statement  which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands  said.  That was not my impression of the meeting   Funaro said;  But if the (British) answer is more or less like this  then that means nothing is helping to find a solution.  Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies  rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.  Since 1982  all official agencies have been closed to my country   he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington  Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved  Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.  We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme   he said   We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens.  Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies  which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year.  Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort   he said.  What we have to offer is our cooperation."
"2","All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed  two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions   but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions  on world grain trade  the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers  NAWG  and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities  a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved  and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be  the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals  which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and  quarantine  U.S. wheat stocks  would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers  they said. Other countries  including Australia  have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs  the organizations said.  We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers   Jim Miller  president of NAWG said.  We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture   Miller said."

"2","U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats  another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture. In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors  Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers  who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.  This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market   Yeutter said. Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT. He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans  making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine  and closer in price to expensive European butter.  I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal   Yeutter said.  It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks)   he said."
"2","Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker  a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal  will serve a third term  sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment  which must be filled this August  has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan  who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement  was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker  first appointed in 1979 by President Carter  will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration  Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker  kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay  the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story  quickly shot down by others in the administration  that Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the council of economic advisers  had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire  it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican  Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.  This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get   said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question  Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership  foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry  but recent statements by Volcker  in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation  signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw  exactly eye-to-eye  on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985  he decided to ensure a good working relationship  in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan  Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term  was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker  whose political skills undermined that ambition  and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay.  Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise   said one.  He'd have to be asked   said Stephen Axilrod  formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise  the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut  he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous  coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor  therefore  would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz  whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal  while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan  frequently an informal presidential economic adviser  New York Fed President E.

"2","Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union  while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports.  It's pure fiction   said one senior official at USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service  referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks. An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation  which he said was started by  somebody fanning the (wheat) market.  Wheat futures strengthened today  partly on the basis of the speculation. One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat  much of it before mid-year  if it was  competitively priced.  Alexander Ivlev  an official with Amtorg  a Soviet trading organization  told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer  but said that Moscow  would consider  buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced.  We don't care if it is EEP  what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices   Ivlev said.  If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat)  they should find ways to do it."

"2","Opec remains within its agreed outputceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day  and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock  he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now  he replied:  Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).  He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market  but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price.  We hope the weak price will be overcome  and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.  Refiners  he said  appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together."
"2","The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today  coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now  they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set  delegates said. Quotas  the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement  were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight  heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue  the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring  coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil  the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively  each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum  U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks  said in a statement after the council adjourned   A majority of producers  led by Brazil  were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.  We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market  instead of their political influence in the ICO.  Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered   Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas  not negotiate them.  Previously  quotas were determined by historical amounts exported  which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks  which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia  the second largest exporter  to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems  illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt  have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings  particularly some African nations and Colombia  are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas  analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year  producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31  but the full council is not due to meet again until September  delegates said."

"2","President Corazon Aquino announcedgovernment plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24 billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the sale of failed businesses taken over by the government.

Whatever laws will be enacted  I say that nobody is above the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are enacted as far as sugar land is concerned   she told reporters. A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan  including the question of whether land operated by multinational companies should also be covered  she added. Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform programme. The plan  requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs  now also covers sugar and coconut areas  apart from rice and corn lands  he said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless peasants  he added. Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break up her family's 6 000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of the most pressing problems facing the Philippines. It was not known whether government would wait for the Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or have Aquino carry it out through an executive order. Under the plan  government will purchase land mainly from landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50 000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos."

"2","Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker  a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal  will serve a third term  sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment  which must be filled this August  has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan  who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement  was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker  first appointed in 1979 by President Carter  will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration  Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker  kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay  the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story  quickly shot down by others in the administration  that Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the council of economic advisers  had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire  it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican  Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.  This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get   said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question  Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership  foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry  but recent statements by Volcker  in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation  signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw  exactly eye-to-eye  on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985  he decided to ensure a good working relationship  in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan  Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term  was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker  whose political skills undermined that ambition  and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay.  Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise   said one.  He'd have to be asked   said Stephen Axilrod  formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise  the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut  he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous  coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor  therefore  would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz  whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal  while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan  frequently an informal presidential economic adviser  New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman  and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege  Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House."

"2","The White House said President Reaganwould make an announcement at 1530 EST/2030 gmt but the topic was undisclosed. A spokesman said officials would brief reporters on details of the announcement afterwards. Athough Reagan's topic was not disclosed  speculation centered on the possible naming of a nominee to to head the CIA or a response to the Soviet Union's offer to negotiate a separate arms control agreement on medium range missiles in Europe."
"2","President Reagan said the UnitedStates would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile reductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow. Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for consultations later this week. He said they will then return to Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact. Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces (INF) separate from strategic and space weapons  Reagan said:  This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF reductions.   To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text at Geneva tomoorrow   Reagan said. He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles   none is more important than verification ... Any agreement must be effectively verifiable.  The United States has been working closely with allies and friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual elimination  the president said. He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in Reykjavik  Iceland  which was shelved when the Soviet leader insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.  I remain firmly committed to these objectives   he said. He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985."

"2","President Reagan  seeking to salvagehis Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal  said a major U.S. economic program for the region was working but needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned. In a report to Congress  he called for immediate approval of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992. The report  mandated by Congress  explains how the administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission  which in 1984 developed a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels. The commission  headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.  The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat   Reagan said. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams  who briefed reporters  said the administration will not try to link approval of military aid for the rebels  known as contras  with the vastly more popular economic package for the region  as some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested. He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra scandal  Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr allotment in military aid for the rebels  who are fighting Managua's leftist Sandinista government. Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest fight in the Democratic-controlled House  but said he believed a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time in six years -- would back the military request."
"2","Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowingto 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986  and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments  the Governor of the Bank of Greece  Dimitris Halikias  said. He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs  but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost. Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986  up from 15.2 billion at end-1985  Halikias said. He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures. He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October  1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985. Halikias said he was  fairly optimistic  Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year. He said domestic demand has fallen  reducing the need for imports  while Greek exports are becoming more competitive. Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period  while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion."

Talks with commercial banks will take place at a later date. Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end Brazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy. Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to its debt crisis of 1982  which he said had provoked the biggest recession in his country's history  he added. He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more flexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks and it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.

"2","Former White House spokesman LarrySpeakes said he and President Reagan misled the public unintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because they themselves were misled by others. In a televised interview  Speakes was contrasting the defensive  much-criticized efforts Reagan made in early attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he expected when the president addressed the nation tonight.  When we went into those press conferences and that nationwide address in November right after the (Iran) story broke  the president did not have the proper information   Speakes said.  And that's why we were misled. And consequently  the president and I misled the public  to a certain extent.   We were badly served by the people that were involved in the Iranian crisis and running the show.  Asked whom he meant  Speakes said former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter; and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North. Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of events  that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts ...  McFarlane has said that he  North and Poindexter had doctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimize Reagan's role in the arms sales.

It will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say he accepts the need for change   said an official who asked not to be identified.  I think the president wants to give his side of the story.  The official said Reagan would tell the public what he is doing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorching Tower commission report on the origins of the scandal. It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of many of his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policy was wrong and he personally made some mistakes. Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would say he erred  White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters   His views are intensely personal and I won't give you any advance on what he intends to say in that area.  He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length and that Reagan would  look beyond the horizon to a revitalized White House that will pursue an active foreign policy.   The president will discuss the Tower board report and its recommendations. He'll focus on changes he's making in the structure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goals for the next two years   the spokesman said. To date  Reagan has defended his decision to sell arms to Iran and conceded only there were errors in implementation. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said tonight's speech might be Reagan's last chance to repair his presidency.  It's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us on another course. It's hard to do that  he probably won't be able to do it   Dole told reporters."

"2","Trans World Airlines Inc complicatedthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or  alternatively  to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today  and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont  but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena.  We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else   said one arbitrager.  We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon.  Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir  but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements.  They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer   said Timothy Pettee  a Bear Stearns analyst.  I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals   said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment  and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont  which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8  also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment  but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.  Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines   said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.  I don't know whose going to buy them  but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package   said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt  in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc  because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns.  It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement   said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA  which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont  dominant in the southeast  to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.  They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy   he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget. Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership  Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT  which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade  would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries  he said.  That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business   Yeutter said.  I think China will develop into a fine market for us   he added."
"2","Rep. Jack Kemp  a New YorkRepublican  urged President Reagan to oppose any legislation to impose a tax on stock transactions. In a statement Kemp called the tax  a money grab to permit Democrats to begin another government spending spree.   I call upon President Reagan to signal immediately that he will veto any tax increase on stock transfers   Kemp said. He added that the tax would punish the 50 million stockholders. House Speaker James Wright  a Texas Democrat  has asked congressional tax analysts to look at a 0.25 to 0.5 pct tax on stock trades along with other tax proposals to help reduce the federal budget deficit."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given the dollar's decline in the last 18 months.  I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the import side. I'm more concerned about the export side   he told a House Appropriations subcommittee. Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating competitive exports  he said."
"2","President Reagan  fighting to regainpublic confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal  admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an arms-for-hostages deal and   It was a mistake.   When it came to managing the NSC (National Security Council) staff  let's face it  my style didn't match its previous track record   Reagan said in a television address to the American people.  I have already begun correcting this   he added in his prepared remarks. Reagan's speech  widely regarded as critical to his hopes of repairing his presidency  was his first detailed response to last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed contra rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he waited for the truth to come out and admitted   I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence.  He said that a few months ago  he told the American people he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert operation.  My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true  but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not   Reagan said.  There are reasons why it happened  but no excuses. It was a mistake   he said. Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government.  It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.  I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan   he said. The commission  headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower  said Reagan's  intense compassion  for Americans being held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy. It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide-ranging  probably illegal activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff  which hatched the operation. Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's recommendations about the running of the NSC  adding   In fact  I'm going beyond its recommendations  so as to put the house in even better order.  He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress   especially on foreign and national security policies.  He said his new national security adviser  Frank Carlucci  was rebuilding the national security staff  with proper management discipline.  Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now consisted of new people. He said that FBI Director William Webster  his new nominee to head the CIA   understands the meaning of 'rule of law' . Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board  which acts as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities. But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations --  No ifs  ands  or buts.  Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong defense of his Iran policy. In a televised speech last November 13  Reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on terrorism  utterly false.  As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union speech  Reagan said that  serious mistakes were made  but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals. By contrast  tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat  confident demeanor. He said he took full responsibility for his own actions  and for those of my administration.   As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge  I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me  I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior   Reagan said. Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress  from allies around the world --  and if we're reading the signals right  even from the Soviets.  His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe."
"2","President Reagan said improperrecord keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran arms initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved arms shipments by Israel before or after the fact. In a televised address to the American people Reagan said he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a complaint made by the Tower commission. The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel.  I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when   Reagan said. Reagan added:  Rest assured  there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House).  The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated various laws  including the Arms Export Control Act."
"2","Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents anounce  following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran  was a mistake   dealers said.

Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities  they added. However  Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price  which is now stabilising at 409.10/60 dlrs  dealers said. On the local market  the metal traded in a narrow range of 3 800 and 3 805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3 778 close."
"2","President Francesco Cossiga meets politicalleaders to discuss how to form a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti  who has been prime minister five times previously and whom the majority Christian Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again. The Socialist Party  the second biggest in the outgoing five-party coalition  said it would accept only Ciriaco De Mita  Christian Democratic Party secretary  or the party's president  Arnaldo Forlani  for the job of prime minister. Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister  the Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general elections are likely unless agreement can be reached. Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding talks with party leaders  including the opposition Communists and the junior coalition members -- Republicans  Liberals and Social Democrats.  After the consultations  Cossiga will name a prime minister-designate who will try to form a government."
"2","Indonesia heads for general elections insix weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20 years  economists and officials said. The government expects no spillover of  people power  from the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of President Suharto  victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the coming parliamentary elections is assured. However  Western diplomats said it is the country's deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its stability. Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia  halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5 billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas account for 70 pct of export income. The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections  Suharto  far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay increases or tax cuts  is busy slashing budget spending. The government has also recently increased transport fares and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the second year running  despite inflation now estimated at 8.8 pct. The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985  while the debt service ratio widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986. Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for almost a third of the 1987/88 budget. A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in 1985  and predicted only a one pct rise this year. In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct  the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings. Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its share of new projects being built with overseas money  because it cannot afford even to meet local costs. In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans totalling 1.55 billion dlrs  on top of its external debt of 37 billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed  and the country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors. A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments. Last month  Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are on the way  including two more from the World Bank worth a total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation. U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's fundamental stability. The largest Moslem nation in the world  Indonesia has so far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless it is tackled. It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that unless economic growth is revived  unemployment could reach what it termed  unacceptable levels.  Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of last year  but those considered underemployed number around 35 pct. What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute within Suharto's government  with his Western-trained technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported by the international financial community. But another group supports a protected economy  with more import substitution  the U.S. Embassy report said. The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the dollar last September to help exports and curb imports  and is currently working on a series of measures to further encourage foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector. The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's ability to raise new loans in the future  Western bankers say. So far  despite three packages of economic measures over the past nine months  he has not touched key monopolies that are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by business associates  diplomats and bankers say. Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems."
"2","Republicans in Congress hailedPresident Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid and constructive while Democrats  who control both houses  said Reagan would now have to match his words with action. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes.  But one speech is not enough to rebuild trust.   President Reagan told the American people what they needed to hear  that mistakes were made and he made them   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said. Reagan  responding to the Tower Commission report criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal  said for the first time the Iran arms policy  and not just its implementation  was a mistake and accepted responsibility for the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels. Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the administration would  remain under a cloud  until several key figures in the scandal  including fired National Security Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John Poindexter  have told  the whole truth.  Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as chief of staff  and the replacement of Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC. Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi  said he believed Reagan took the right measure in admitting mistakes without apologising for them. Some House Democrats  including Speaker James Wright of Texas  said earlier they would delay their reaction until tomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess its impact."
"2","OPEC countries are all sticking firmly toofficial crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter  Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto  attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference  blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand.  If we stick to the production limitation  the third quarter will be in better balance.  He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices  Subroto said:  Apparently they have taken care of that.   They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they'll help each other   he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.  Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices   he said."
"2","Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke andTreasurer Paul Keating said the government's 1986/87 Budget deficit could hit four billion dlrs against the official forecast of 3.5 billion. Hawke told a Sydney radio station the deficit  may turn out at four billion.  He and Keating last week warned that the budget deficit was running above target and vowed sharp decisions on spending in a May 14 economic statement. A four billion dollar Budget deficit would be in line with private economists' forecasts and compares with a 1985/86 shortfall of 5.73 billion dlrs. Hawke said the 1986/87 deficit would be equal to 1.5 pct of forecast Gross Domestic Product against five pct when he took office during the 1982/83 year.  In money terms (the deficit has been reduced) from the 9.6 billion dlrs that we inherited ... Down to about 3.6 billion  it may turn out at four billion dlrs   Hawke said. In a separate interview Keating said:  The deficit for this year  projected  was 3.5 billion .... It is in fact running ... Over four billion and we will be trying to bring that in close to target."
"2","Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Partystarted moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament  deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable. In the absence of the opposition  LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14  parliamentary officials said. The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan. Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based. A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  who has vowed to push through the tax reforms  told reporters:  Watching closely negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties  I would like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly.  The five pct tax  part of Nakasone's tax reform plan  is planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual income and corporate tax. The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower House plenary session  political analysts said. The four opposition parties called the LDP move  an unforgivable  rash act  and said they would fight to scrap the sales tax."
"2","The Bank of France is likely to cut itsmoney market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall  dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22  which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23  the day after the Paris accord  and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3  where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point  the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2  when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates  while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut  and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday  although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning  banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France  discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target  giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply  the government's key aggregate  finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target  rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985."
"2","USAir Group Inc said its board hasrejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders  employees or passengers. The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was  highly conditional.  USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each  valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said  In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer  the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made  USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.  TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont  a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders  employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests.  USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont.

"2","Responsibility for the appreciation ofthe Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries  said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society  Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea.  An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term  but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community   Yeutter said. For Taiwan  Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S.  much larger than that of Japan's  and with huge foreign exchange reserves  it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals   otherwise in two or three years' time  Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan.  Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs  Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable.  Something must give soon. If not  there is a great threat of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend   Yeutter said."
"2","Congressional ire is rising againstthe multinational development banks which make loans to help other countries produce goods in direct competition with beleagured U.S. farmers and miners. With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year and a farm economy in the doldrums  Congress is pressing to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.  American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct competition with our producers   Senator Don Nickles  an Oklahoma Republican  said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans. Nickles and Senator Steven Symms  a conservative Republican from Idaho  have introduced legislation that would strictly limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus commodities or minerals. Current law requires that the United States vote against such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately approved by the banks. Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S. policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised at two Senate committee hearings last week. Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations   As a policy matter  we oppose loans for production of commodities in oversupply.  The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989. Nickles  Symms and others also have cited other loans such as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at low interest rates for agriculture. Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S. funding of development banks by the amount of these loans. But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal  the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared Congress. This year's version  called the Foreign Agricultural Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote against loans designed to increase production of surplus commodities and minerals. Also  the recipient countries would have to prove that the production  marketing and export of the commodities could be handled without government subsidy. If the loan is approved over U.S. objections  the United States would not increase or replenish funds for that institution until it agrees to stop making such loans. Objections to such loans have most often been raised by conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S. funding for these international development banks. But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised similar concerns among more moderate senators. The administration opposes any legislation that would tie its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be instances in which a country needed the money to continue its moves toward U.S. policies in other areas. Baker said the United States would continue to use its leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization measures  often in the form of elimination of subsidies. Two House Republicans  Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho and Beau Bolter of Texas  have introduced the bill. But it faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has blocked its consideration by the House in the past. Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any related legislation this year  an aide said."

Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices  Wilson said it has to be recognized the area was a  prisoner of market forces outside the boundaries of this country.  Wilson  appearing before the committee to discuss the government's spending estimates released earlier this week  said the government is doing what it can in the region  citing more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.  Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on our part in dealing with a very difficult problem   Wilson said in response to questions about management of the economy from opposition party members. He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States  which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada."

"2","Brazil has no set target forits coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas  President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets  he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations  but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags  he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers  exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy  but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions.  We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic   Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.  Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch   Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks  Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.  It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover   he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas  he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks  noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers  particularly Colombia  Mexico and Francophone African countries  but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts  although  no hypothesis has been abandoned.  Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance  as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags  more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that  although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop  the IBC would not make any estimate until late April."
"2","Securities and Exchange Commissionchairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping insider trading  but the chairman of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about conditions on Wall Street.  Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey   Rep. Edward Markey  D-Mass  the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities.  Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come   Markey said.  The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing.  Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky  Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment  high fines and disbarment from the securities industry.  Insider trading has not been eradicated  but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders   Shad said in his statement. Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years. Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts. N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo  the senior subcommittee Republican  said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.  Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy of existing surveillance systems and government oversight operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws   Rinaldo said."
"2","Leaks of a major Dutch officialeconomic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year  political and market sources say. Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase  zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government's response  the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm  they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy. Merchant bank Pierson  Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany  the main Dutch trading partner  and the lower dollar  Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50 000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market  noting  the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates.  Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate  and interest rate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital  they said  noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment. Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut  but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder. Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank  with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first. One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden. A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank.  The cabinet's policy is steady  the guilder has to stay with the mark   he said."

"2","A reduction of the U.S. federal budgetdeficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit  U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said. Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry  Yeutter said  Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now.  Unless we get the budget deficit down  we will not get the trade deficit down.  He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits. Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and  to a lesser extent  other U.S. securities as well.  We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987  but there's still a long way to go   Yeutter said. He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth  U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a  level playing field  for trade. The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down. On the fiscal side  Yeutter said  the budget deficit is still our biggest problem  and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit. In the international area  he said that  our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.  Commenting on Japan  which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States  Yeutter said  Japan is just not doing the job on the import side.  Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner. In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting  Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies  but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.  The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end   Yeutter said. However  he added that  if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit   the dollar will be the equalizer.  Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers. He said  there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem.  Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners  Yeutter said.  There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation   Yeutter said  adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems."
"2","World Bank president Barber Conablesaid he believed that Brazil would come up with a medium term economic plan and that the current debt moritorium would be temporary.

Brazil would like to come up with such a plan   he said  adding:  the moritorium is likely to be a temporary affair.  During his formal remarks  Conable made it clear that he believed Brazil must take some specific internal action. He said  they have everyone's attention but it must be followed by a construtive plan.  He said that he expected Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro  who he met with last week to discuss the Brazilian debt suspension action  to return for further discussion but did not currently have a specific meeting arranged. Conable also told the gathering of mostly commericial bankers that in order for the Baker debt initiative to work all parties to the program must be on board."
"2","Charles Haughey  leader of the Irishparty Fianna Fail  said if he becomes prime minister following last month's Irish general election  he will seek the advice of the EC Commission on management of the country's 24 billion punt foreign debt. Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17 poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt management was made to him today by Commission president Jacques Delors. Haughey said:  Delors assured me we could have full recourse to the Commission for advice  guidance and expert skills in dealing with our overall financial problems  particularily in the matter of debt management.  Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion punts a year  he added : If we could achieve any significant improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of servicing  it could have significant budgetary benefits.  He added that he would seek advice  not a Community loan. However  Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at favorable interest rates  notably for onlending to its farming sector.  It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before and we would look at it again   he said. Haughey said he regarded as  almost paramount  the maintenance of the punt's current position within the European Monetary System. He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight pct last August.  Until 1983  the policy of the Irish government was to was to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I believe that policy was right   Haughey said."
"2","Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid forUSAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc  which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday  Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont  which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today  USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963 000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.  The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal   speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor  Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock  and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers  however  believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir  they said  is the least likely to be bought. Icahn  who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry  also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination  including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer  which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still  he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.  You can't discount him   said one arbitrager. Analysts  however  said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir  Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer.  It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing   said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles  but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately.  TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work   said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure  since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger  TWA would have to be the surviving entity  analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA  they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year  and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However  other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA."
"2","Finance Minister Michael Wilson saidlarge inflows of capital into Canada  principally into the country's bond market  is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar. He said the inflow of funds  mainly from Japan  Europe and the United States  is the result of  confidence in the direction this country is going in.   That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts   Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period. Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986  more than double the previous year  with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market.

"2","Top U.S. and European farm trade andgovernment representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production.  It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe  the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful   U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting  which ends tomorrow  demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the  imbalance and tensions of the world economy   the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices  allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand  and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids  proposed James Howard  Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA)  one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter  agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However   differentiated policy treatment is required  to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC  he said.  Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community   he said."

"2","Brazil's recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987. The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans  and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets  economists said.  That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation   Aldo Roldan  Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics  said. Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets  but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable.  Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates   Roldan said. The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil  where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs. But he added:  They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels.  Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee  and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance. Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence.  Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations  which others wanted changed   one senior coffee dealer said. The dealer  who declined to be named  said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks  he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer. Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales  the dealer said.  If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar  ninety or eighty cents   he said. New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb  while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit. President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute  Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas. Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts.  They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been   according to Richard Loewy  analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem  a good crop  plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop.  Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops   he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields.  We are going to see a very rapid decline  earlier than usual  this year in our (U.S.) exports   Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman  economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA)  said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes  versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate  offered to farmers who give crops as collateral  Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate  which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan.  We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export   Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration.  The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage   he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops  Melicias said it would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets  Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest  which could limit exports to the world market  analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments  and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar  will give it little room to stretch exports  they said. Brazil's other major crop  cocoa  is in its third year of surplus.  Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell  so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it   one analyst said.  If they come out as aggressive sellers  the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that   she added."

"2","Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funarolast night concluded this week's tour of European capitals having gleaned little in the way of concrete support from governments for his country's attempts to find a radical solution to its debt payments crisis. However  banking sources noted the existence of considerable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its commercial bank creditors  manifested in the widespread belief that adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems while patience might pave the way for an eventual reconciliation. Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks  followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions. The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration in Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter of 1986  along with a marked acceleration in inflation. Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs. Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week visited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government officials and agencies. This week they have sought official support in the U.K.  France  Germany  Switzerland and Italy. They have now decided to extend their tour  flying on Sunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials  with a possible visit to Canada before they return home. Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to government representatives  believing that problems with Brazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution. However  banking sources noted that their attempts to enlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been met almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks. This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for Brazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme  with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also recommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly."

Baker  when asked if the policy was changed in view of comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the dollar by 10 to 15 pct  replied   No.  Yesterday Robert Ortner  Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs  said he thought the yen was undervalued but said that was his personal view. This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions. Baker  who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper Association  declined to elaborate on his statement about U.S. policy."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakersaid the Japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this year. He told the National Newspaper Association  You're going to see a reduction in the Japanese trade surplus -- some of it this year .

We as a government are overspending   he told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex) has proposed a transfer tax to be paid by buyers and sellers of stocks."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is  very disappointed  by a Canadian government finding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.  This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing U.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations   Lyng said in a statement. The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports. Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers  adding that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.  Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising faster than consumption   Lyng said."
"2","U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. corn imports injure Canadian farmers is  totally unjustified.   U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any reasonable measure   Yeutter said in a statement. He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it could result in  a rash of protectionist actions throughout the world.  French corn growers have recently indicated they will challenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe. Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision closely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on facts   will carefully evaluate appropriate responses.  Yeutter did not say what steps the U.S. may take in response."

"2","The House and Senate committeesinvestigating the Iran arms scandal said they would like to review tapes of phone conversations between President Reagan and White House officials  if such tapes exist. The committees were responding to a magazine article that quoted unidentified  sources with first-hand knowledge of U.S. communications intelligence  as saying there is an archive of recorded conversations among Reagan administration officials  including the president. The article in Progressive magazine also said the government had secretly monitored the home telephone of former National Security adviser Robert McFarlane after he had left government service in late 1985.  According to sources with first hand knowledge of U.S. communications intelligence operations   the story said   the McFarlane intercept grew out of a program that has produced a still-undisclosed archive of recorded conversations involving ... Reagan  Vice President George Bush  (fired National Security Council aide) Lt Col Oliver North  (former National Security Adviser) Adm John Poindexter  (former White House Chief of Staff) Donald Regan and other key figures in the Iran-contra arms scandal.  It said the monitoring was done for security and record purposes by the top-secret National Security Agency (NSA)  and was apparently done with the consent of those monitored. But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied one premise of the article  saying   The National Security Agency said it did not monitor any of McFarlane's conversations.  He did not comment on the other recorded conversations the Progressive article said were included in the program.  Clearly we would be interested in taking a look if indeed such tapes exist   a Senate Iran committee aide told Reuters in response to the magazine article. A spokesman for the House Iran committee said the panel would consider a request to the NSA for copies of the telephone-tap archive described in the article. Several legislators said the tapes  if it is confirmed that they exist  could prove invaluable to the special House and Senate committees that were created in January to investigate Reagan's most damaging political crisis.  This sort of evidence could be absolutely crucial in getting to the bottom of the affair   said Rep. Robert Kastenmeier  a Wisconsin Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee  told Reuters."

"2","Brazil's economic crisis is forcing awholesale re-examination of the established strategy for dealing with developing-country debt  leading bankers say. While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeed in his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the debt problem  Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least some bankers that new ideas are needed.  The time has come to look at the alternatives   one seasoned debt rescheduler said. Even before Brazil's move  the difficulty in syndicating the 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to in principle last October was prompting top bankers to examine the way they are managing the debt crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker  too  spoke recently of  debt fatigue  and the need to breathe new life into debt rescheduling procedures. There are already signs of change. Japanese banks are setting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer some LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets  improve financial management and get tax breaks. But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role will be gradual.  The process is such that you cannot expect tangible progress in a short period of time   one banker said. Certainly  Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and several European capitals in the past week when he called on government officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a political dialogue on debt. Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford  for instance  criticized what he called large-scale solutions such as debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending agencies.  While such approaches may have some political appeal  they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive   Mulford told a House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any proposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks would be a non-starter in Congress. But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote accounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps and debt securitization and to enable banks to consider interest capitalization as an alternative to new loans. Experts say the government must also make it easier for banks gradually to write down their third-world loan books. Mulford  in his Congressional testsimony  urged the banks to explore different options.  The banks should be encouraged to look at the so-called menu approach   he said. Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates intact or  conversely  to allow small banks to write off their exposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders. Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to receive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to new loans. In effect  large banks say they are making new loans that fund the interest payments on the old debt. To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome negotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of  exit bonds   which would be issued at a discount to small creditors in exchange for their existing debt  bankers said. The banks would be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss. Amid the swirl of new ideas  even the role of the commercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny. The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was challenged recently when Citibank - ironically  the original architect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a time to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile. The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington.  There does seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the bank advisory committees   a U.S. official said. Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on Monday  charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and that U.S. banks are over-represented on them. Hannes Androsch  chairman of Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein  said there was some truth to the charge.  Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer prepared to bail out the U.S. banks   he told reporters in New York this week. While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently  some have started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still the right tool for the job.  The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity of commercial banks alone  at least in some cases   one top New York rescheduler said. But  with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger role  bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.  It's the worst form of government there is apart from all the others   one banker said  paraphrasing former British prime minister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy."
"2","Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid the export enhancement program (eep) could be funded from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) if the one billion dlrs appropriated for export bonus by Congress is exhausted. Lyng told reporters lack of funding should not be a constraint on the program because USDA has the authority to use CCC funds to continue the program. He noted Congress authorized up to 1.5 billion dlrs for eep. Earlier this week  Leo Mayer  associate administrator of USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service  said 865 mln dlrs of the one billion in appropriated funds for eep have been used. USDA officials said if all the eep offers announced are accepted by importing countries the one billion dlrs would be exhausted soon. Some Congressional sources have expressed concern that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) might try to block USDA from seeking more than the one billion dlrs appropriated for the program. These sources suggested the lack of funds might force USDA to halt the program  which some commodity groups believe has given a boost to U.S. exports of some farm products  particularly wheat and wheat flour. However  Lyng's comments seemed to suggest that USDA could at least temporarily continue the program using CCC funds and would not be forced to curtail eep."
"2","Senior officials in the West Germancoalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks  in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler  General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party  detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party  said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform  which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks  would be introduced next year  ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that  while the economy would continue to expand this year  the rate of growth was uncertain. The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct  but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below. Stoltenberg said:  We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct  as some people believe  or around 2.5 pct as some others expect  or even closer to three pct  as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago  remains open at the moment."

"2","Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehltold a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move  banking sources said. The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited. The sources  speaking separately  said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany.  It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates   said one banker who attended the symposium. A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks  made at the private meeting. But  according to a second source  who also declined to be identified  Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.  He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly   the second source said. In reply to questions  Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance  the sources said. Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded  by cuts in German rates  to come to the bargaining table as early as last September  one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying   No  they wouldn't have been. We checked that.  The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates. Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting  saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar  the sources said. For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies  including the U.S.  Poehl had said. The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation. One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany's economic growth. Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation. This led  for instance  to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January. The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs. Latest data for central bank money stock  the Bundesbank's main measure of money supply  showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January  outside its three to six pct 1987 target. Share prices rose in very active trading today  with dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks  coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium  brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels."

"2","Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said thegovernment was considering selling Petro-Canada and the sale would proceed if it were in the national interest to do so. Mulroney told the House of Commons assets of the huge oil company would be examined before a decision was made  just as other state-run companies were studied before being sold under Ottawa's privatization program.  The government is going to examine assets of this nature to ascertain if they continue to play an appropriate role in public policy and we will make a determination as we have in other cases   Mulroney told the daily question period. Asked by opposition members to clairify Finance Minister Michael Wilson's statement on Friday that Petro-Canada no longer has any pubilic policy role  Mulroney said his government has long promised to sell off companies that could be better run by the private sector. Outside the House  Energy Minister Marcel Masse said Petro-Canada would be worth between three and four billion dlrs and  because of the size  could be difficult to sell. He also said he would prefer to see Canadians participating in any privatization  but would not give any details on timing of a sale."
"2","The Philippines' bank advisorycommittee meets tomorrow to discuss its response to a novel proposal by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest bill with investment notes instead of cash  bankers said. Ongpin outlined his plan today to the 12-bank advisory committee headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Bankers declined to comment on today's meeting but said the panel's response could be crucial to the fate of the talks  which are now in their second week.  The ball's in our court now   one banker on the committee said. Under Ongpin's rescheduling plan  the Philippines would offer to make interest payments in cash at 5/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. Banks which found this rate unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of LIBOR payments in cash plus a margin of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes  PINs  bankers explained. These tradable  dollar-denominated zero-coupon notes would have a maturity of six years  but they would be redeemable at any time at par for pesos to fund investments approved as part of the government's debt-equity scheme. Because banks would be able to sell the PINs to multinational investors at relatively small discounts to face value  their total yield would be boosted well above the 5/8 pct cash margin  according to the Philippine proposal. Although bankers are eager to foster foreign investment in the Philippines  the PINs idea is likely to run into stiff resistance by at least some members of the bank advisory committee because it would establish the precedent of some interest payments being made with paper rather than cash. Ongpin has said that U.S. regulators and accountants had given a green light to his idea  but bankers are not so sure. U.S. bankers fear that they would not be able to account for the notes in the same way as accruing cash interest payments and that their profits would suffer accordingly. If the banks reject the proposal out of hand  however  they run the risk of scuttling the talks  for Ongpin has insisted that he would not accept a margin above 5/8 pct. The Phillipines is asking the banks to reschedule 3.6 billion dlrs of debt falling due between 1987 and 1992 and to grant easier terms on 5.8 billion dlrs of previously restructured debt."
"2","President Reagan signed an orderallowing sales of U.S. nuclear fuel to the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) to continue for a further year  even though they do not comply with a 1978 U.S. law. Under the law  which is designed to combat the spread of nuclear weapons  foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel must get American consent to any reprocessing. The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11 rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear cooperation agreements  signed more than 20 years ago  to conform with the 1978 law. Since 1978 the U.S.-EURATOM nuclear coooperation accords have been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders. State Department officials said negotiations had made more progress in the last two years after the United States had offered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement  rather than requiring EURATOM to have U.S. consent for each fuel delivery. In notifying Congress of today's order extending U.S.-EURATOM nuclear cooperation  Reagan said:  A disruption of nuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance of progress in our talks with EURATOM related to our agreements  it would also cause serious problems in our relationships.  He said further progress in talks with EURATOM was expected this year."

Currently  some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S.  down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4 500 in December 1981.

"2","New Zealand's total foreign debtwill continue to decline as major energy projects are refinanced  Finance Minister Roger Douglas said. Statistics Department figures show total debt fell to 32.94 billion N.Z. Dlrs in the December quarter from 33.42 billion in September  although the government's share rose to 21.32 billion from 20.75 billion. Douglas said in a statement this was due to the boosting of reserves to refinance so-called  Think Big  projects.  These reserves do not add to New Zealand's total indebtedness.... They are money in the bank   he said.  As negotiations to refinance each Think Big project are completed  existing loans will be replaced with debt currently held in reserves for this purpose   Douglas added. This in turn will result in a drop in quasi-government and private debt  he said. He said refinancing of projects allowed the government to borrow on more favourable terms and to manage Think Big debts more effectively.  Both of these will reduce the cost of Think Big to the taxpayer over time   he said.  The refinancing also paves the way to deregulation of the oil industry."
"2","Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.  The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy   he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris  Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand  which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity  he added."

"2","King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wantsoil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied:  Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.  Non-OPEC countries  must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone   he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices  King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure  due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia  the world's largest oil exporter  was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer  Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output. The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war.

The socialist winner  backed by other opposition parties  had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax  the main plank of the reform plans. The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax. They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1  which includes the tax plans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of parliament since February 4.  If I were Nakasone  I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled  attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans   the aide said. Under law  a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other option would be to extend the current session  he said.  The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another.  One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform.  Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election   the aide said. That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512-seat Lower House  necessitating by-elections. The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July. There are five independents and three vacancies.  The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats  but at the expense of fierce media criticism   the aide said. He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26. About 2 600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.  Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.  Possible effects  if any  will be on gubernatorial elections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and Fukuoka in southern Japan   he said. The two posts are now held by opposition socialists."
"2","Prices rose on the Danish bondmarket after Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said the government was prepared to impose further austerity measures to limit domestic consumption if the economy did not improve over the summer. A typical 20-year mortgage bond had risen to 81 by noon from 79-1/4 at the close last night.  It is because of possible optimism that the government will intervene if necessary   one dealer told Reuters. Schlueter said after a routine cabinet meeting yesterday  If economic tightening up is necessary  we will do it.  The government has already imposed three austerity packages since December 1985  in an attempt to bring down the external current account deficit  which rose to a preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion the previous year. Schlueter made clear that an autumn general election would not make the government postpone any austerity measures. The government has to call an election by January 1988. He expressed surprise at concern in some financial quarters over the level of private and public wage settlements last month  worth a minimum three to four pct a year. These would lead to higher productivity  Schlueter said."
"2","Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.  The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy   he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris  Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand  which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity  he added."
"2","European CommunityCommission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan for changes to Community financing. In a speech to the European Parliament  Delors said some EC leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves pruning their own spending. Others called for major spending cut in the EC's controversial farm policy in order to free money for regional and social development. The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a second two-year term. Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the EC should be based on their gross national product instead of on the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of sharing the financial burden. He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about increased payments  he had told some heads of government the Community needs more money. Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to reform the EC farm policy  which currently accounts for over two thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget. We have to ask for sacrifices but we have to create a future for those farmers.  He added   I was forced to say to some heads of government - Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when you are asking for a common market in goods and services?  EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine internal market in industrial products and services. Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes."
"2","Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneyannounced a major shakeup in the ranks of his key advisers after weeks of continuing criticism of his government. Mulroney announced the departure of his senior policy advisor  the resignation of his press secretary and the reassignment of his communications director. Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government  shaken by a series of cabinet resignations and allegations of corruption  has been trailing the opposition parties for months in public opinion polls. The prime minister  who led the Conservatives to a landslide victory in the 1984 general election  had been urged by party loyalists to make major changes within his office. A cabinet shuffle is expected later this month in advance of more personnel changes within Mulroney's office as the prime minister seeks to regain public confidence. The next election is expected sometime in 1988  although it could be delayed until mid-1989."
"2","The Reagan administration is totallyopposed to recent Democratic suggestions that securities transactions should be taxed to help curb the budget deficit  an administration official said in an interview.  We're totally opposed to a securities transfers tax. It would impair the efficiency of some of the most efficient markets in the world   he said. He declined to be named. In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright  a Texas Democrat  has called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs he estimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets.  It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthy individuals but on middle income people who occasionally invest and trade. So I think it's a very bad idea   said the official  who is an administration economic policy-maker. The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that the administration delay next year's cut in top tax rates  called for in the recently-passed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system.  It is breaking faith with the American people ... It would be a real breach of faith   he said. The Gramm-Rudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budget by 1991  but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court. Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass President Reagan's budget proposals for the fiscal year starting this October  they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108 billion dlr target for the budget deficit set under the Gramm-Rudman law. The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrs in the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts and revenue increases will achieve the Gramm-Rudman goal. The official  who is knowlegeable on budget strategy  also said President Reagan was still opposed to a so-called 'budget summit' with Congress to resolve the deficit issue. The suggestion of a 'budget summit' emerged again recently after Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed a deficit reduction package and an arms control accord with Moscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal. But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as an attempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase. He accused them of being overly critical before they had written their own budget proposal  due out on April 1.  It's easier to write a book review than it is to write a book. We've written a book and the Democrats are writing a book review every day. Let's see their book   he said."
"2","Senators and a special prosecutorwere in dispute today over a legal maneuver to force quick answers from key figures in the Iran arms scandal and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. Senators on a special Senate committee investigating the scandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution to force early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and John Poindexter. North is the National Security Council (NSC) aide President Reagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iran arms payments to the so-called contra rebels. Poindexter  who was NSC director and North's boss  resigned the same day. The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexter was ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the funds diversion  contrary to Reagan's denial that he knew of it. Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said he asked a special House committee yesterday to delay limited immunity for North and Poindexter for at least 90 days  and would make the same request to the Senate committee today. Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delay granting immunity for a third key figure  retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord  a close North associate. Walsh  whose job is to determine whether anyone should be prosecuted for criminal misconduct  said premature immunity could put the three beyond the law before a grand jury can decide whether they should be prosecuted."

"2","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)is reviewing whether Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> and Chairman Carl Icahn violated federal antitrust law by failing to seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal Trade Commission for his extensive open-market purchases of USAir Group Inc &lt;U> stock  a DOJ official told a Senate panel.  This is a matter that is being looked into   Charles Rule  acting assistant attorney general-antitrust  told the Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee. Rule declined further comment while the review was continuing. Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio)  who had asked why the department was not acting against  what appears to be a clear violation of the law.  Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15 mln dlrs' worth of USAir stock. But Rule said that  for airline companies  a purchaser would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Icahn filed such an application with the DOT  but the filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday. The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it lacked the necessary data for the government to review the proposed USAir takeover bid. Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday. Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation were found."
"2","With troops in place in Brazil'sports and oil installations  the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force. Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production. The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55 000 oil industry employees. The government had already dispatched more than 1 000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40 000 seamen  now in its 13th day  represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike  which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships  but the military presence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship  the Docemarte  seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal  the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders  Elmano Barbosa  said  it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods.  Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos  the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal  were working. At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro  spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports. Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro  seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food. The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's civilian government since it came to power two years ago. Yesterday  in a separate protest  hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates. The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze."
"2","Canadian Foreign Secretary JoeClark  winding up a two-day visit to Washington  said he expected the Reagan administration to take some action on reducing acid rain.  My impression is there will be some movement by the United States administration on acid rain (but) how much movement I can't judge or predict   he told reporters. The meetings with American officials are part of a routine U.S.-Canada consultation but are also expected to lay the groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month between President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Clark today held discussions with Treasury Secretary James Baker and Democratic Sens. Patrick Moynihan of New York  Christopher Dodd of Connecticut  Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and George Mitchell of Maine. Yesterday  he held talks with Vice President George Bush  Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. Among its priorities  Canada is seeking evidence that Reagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year to implement in the United States a five-year 5 billion U.S. dlr program to test cleaner ways of burning coal. This issue was discussed at length with Baker and several of the senators  including Mitchell who urged Canada to  keep the heat on  the Reagan administration to force action  Canadian officials said. Also taken up with most of the senators and Baker were trade issues  including the need for the United States and Canada to establish a better mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries  who are each other's major trading partner  Canadian officials said."

The vote was seen as a temporary defeat for Reagan  who has made aid to the  contras  a key initiative. Congressional Democratic leaders have conceded that despite today's vote  they can not muster a two-thirds majority to override a certain Reagan veto. But they have said it is likely they can win a battle expected this fall over 105 mln dlrs iin new aid Reagan is requesting."
"2","House trade lawmakers took theirfirst votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session  the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt  a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination  said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan  South Korea  Taiwan  West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.  My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down   he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright  a Texas Democrat  said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.  I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill   he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology  to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition  to stimulate research and development  to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining  safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country's economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday   I am cautiously optimistic   that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill."

The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested   he said.

Douglas said   Net expenditure to this point in the year was about as we would have expected it to be  while revenue was slightly ahead of forecast.  He said   Revenue before provisional tax flows is looking encouraging at this stage in the year.  But he said considerable uncertainty remains about the year-end revenue result  because of difficulty predicting the size of March tax collections."

"2","Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said heheld  frank  discussions with the Canadian province premiers on the pace of free trade talks with the United States  but the longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be settled. Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers  Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal. But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago.  It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the talks)   Mulroney said. Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed   Things are running pretty quickly now.  The talks  launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S.  are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world's largest trading partnership. But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement  and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula.  It's my view that we should be thinking about these things right now  along with the questions of the substance of the agreement   commented Ontario Premier David Peterson  who has been highly critical of the talks in the past. But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a  hard and fast formula.  Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas  such as agriculture. Canadian published reports  quoting government sources  say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is hoped to be presented to Congress in October.  It's a very tight time frame   Ontario's Peterson said last night.  But at this moment it is tough to say what will transpire."
"2","Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen toits lowest level in more than a year  giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel  as agreed by Opec last December  oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait  compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world  which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia  the world s largest oil exporter  was insisting on getting Opec official prices  even at the cost of lower production  the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs.  Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions   he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday  down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers  the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil  Exxon  Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices  the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve  the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations."

He noted that in fiscal 1986 the federal government disbursed 42 billion dlrs in new direct loans and guaranteed loans totalling 159 billion dlrs. Under the reform bill  Fitzwater said the subsidy element in direct loan and guaranteed loan programs would be established and Congress would appropriate the amount of the subsidy to the lending agency.

"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month. In an interview with Reuters  Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef and citrus exports. Lyng  who plans to be in Japan April 14-27  said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market.  We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market   he said. The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the U.S. would request.  We've got none of it now. If we got one per cent of it  it would be a big improvement   he said. Last year  the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions. However  the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice exports. Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas  but that his visit  may be a forerunner in a general way  to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988. He said  however  that the U.S.  will ask for a definite liberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When you translate 'liberalization' into Japanese  it means do away with the quota."

Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the department's export enhancement program  Lyng said   No. We haven't made a decision on it  haven't even talked about it  haven't even looked at it.  Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy U.S. wheat if competitively priced  Lyng responded   If they (the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat  would we accept it? It would depend on what price they offered.  Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat was far off the world price. Asked about persistent speculation that the administration would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy  Lyng said   Some people think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in the market.  Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S. wheat subsidy offer was imminent."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.  It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it   Lyng said in an interview with Reuters.  It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing   he said. However  Lyng said he did not want to make a  definitive commitment one way or another at this point.  Under the accord covering 1983-88  the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain  including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat. Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153 000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year  which ended last September  and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn. Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow would buy this year.  I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know how they know  unless they talk to the Soviets   he said.  I have no knowledge  and I really don't think anyone other than the Soviets have any knowledge.  Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last month because  they needed it and because the price was right.   Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think they've always found that our corn was good   he said."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price. Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans  Lyng said   I don't think so. I don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway.  However  the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted  it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan.  I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans   he said.  It might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan)  if there were a world market that was lower than our market."
"2","Director of the Office of Managementand Budget James Miller said the Reagan administration had no intention of raising taxes in order to reduce the federal budget deficit.  There will be no tax increases   he said three times before a Management Briefing luncheon of Southern Methodist University's Edwin L. Cox School of Business. The budget deficit  which is currently slated at 173 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988  is supposed to be reduced to 108 billion dlrs under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act  which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991. Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reduced but added   the surest way to put us in a pickle  would be to raise or ease the Gramm-Rudman goal.  If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform  it would create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets   he said  adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficit would also create uncertainty. Miller reiterated the president's budget proposal that the deficit could be reduced by a total of 42 billion dlrs through increased revenues and spending cuts. An additional 23 billion dlrs from economic growth is expected to result in the budget deficit being reduced to the 108 billion dlr target. Miller said it was possible the Administration might support an oil import fee  but added that the President was concerned that such a move might have more adverse results than benefits. He also said the Administration was seeking to spin off Amtrak  which costs the government about 500 mln dlrs a year  but added that he did not expect it to be accomplished this year."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.  The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been reversed   Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here. However  Volcker said there are encouraging signs  particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year  achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad. Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debt. He said the process of restoring external balance to the U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of financial and real resources into internationally competitive industry.  More of our growth will need to be reflected in net exports and business investment and less in consumption   Volcker said."
"2","President Reagan today had talkswith Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi  who afterwards appealed for more U.S. investment in Kenya and a deeper American commitment to ending apartheid in South Africa. A senior administration official said that during the talks Reagan stressed to Moi the importance of Kenya's maintaining its high standards on human rights. The official said South Africa had not been a contentious issue in the talks and that the two leaders had found a lot of common ground on the issue. The administration has practiced a policy of  constructive engagement  with South Africa and accepted trade sanctions only after they had been imposed by Congress."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said severe problems remain in some sectors of the U.S. economy despite progress in others.  Severe problems in some sectors of the economy are all too obvious   he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon of business leaders here. He said oil exploration and development  as well as agricultural prices  have been heavily affected by worldwide surpluses. Commercial construction  he said  is suffering from earlier over-building in many areas. More broadly  he said  there are distortions and imbalances in the U.S. economy that cut across many sectors.  Unless dealt with effectively and forcibly  they will undermine all that has been achieved   Volcker warned. He said one problem is that economic activity over the past two years has been supported largely by consumption. He said that rising consumption was achieved at the expense of reduced personal savings. At the same time  he said  the huge Federal budget deficit is absorbing a disproportionate amount of the savings generated in the U.S. Volcker said the adverse consequences of the combination of low savings rates and high Federal budget deficits have been escaped by drawing on capital from abroad. He noted that the net flow of foreign capital into the U.S. in 1986 exceeded all the savings by U.S. households.  That is a graphic demonstration of the extent to which our financial markets are hostage to possible changes in external attitudes and circumstances   Volcker said."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.  A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern  both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve   he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders here. He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets  which would push import prices up sharply. He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.  Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy  the consequences for interest rates  for exchange rates  and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy   the Fed chairman said. Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk dissipating the flow of foreign capital."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said that Brazil will need more external financing to work its way out of its current debt crisis than earlier anticipated.  External financing will have to be found in larger amounts than anticipated a few months ago   he said in remarks prepared for a business leader luncheon. Volcker said that financing  however  must take place along with policies that come to grips with Brazil's internal difficulties. Volcker said Brazil has a lot more negotiating to do with international institutions and its bank creditors but added that a solution to its financial problems can be found.  The predicate for these negotiations has to be effective policy at home (in Brazil)   Volcker told reporters.  Brazil  it seems to me  has a strong self interest in restoring a more normal situation (on interest payments) so that it can continue to participate freely in trade with the rest of the world - and it has so indicated   Volcker said in his prepared remarks. Brazil suspended interest payments on its debt last month."
"2","Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker said a combination of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  FDIC  and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp  FSLIC  could be contemplated in the longer term but is not an answer to the thrift industry's immediate problems.  I don't think it's an answer to 1977 or 1988   Volcker said at a press conference. But a merger of the two deposit-insurance agencies could be an option as part of a general structural reform of the U.S. banking system. The aim of a merger would not be for commercial banks to subsidize ailing savings and loan associations but to improve official oversight of depository institutions  Volcker said.  The attractive element is that you get almost by definition a consistency of supervision and regulation that you don't have now   he explained."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a bill passed this week by the Senate banking committee is too restrictive regarding the Federal Reserve.  I don't think our hands should be tied so much as in that bill   he said. The bill would set a one-year moratorium on approval of certain powers that banks have already applied to the Federal Reserve for -- selling insurance  securities and real estate. Volcker added  however  that comprehensive new legislation dealing with such issues is needed."
"2","Debt talks between the Philippinegovernment and its bank advisory committee were delicately poised after a brief meeting between the two sides today  bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said.  We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress   a banker said.  The banks are anxious to come to an agreement.  But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talks would end successfully. Caution was also evident in the Philippine camp.  We feel the ball's in the banks' court   one source said. The two sides will meet again on Friday. The talks  in which the Philippines is seeking to reschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt  are now dominated by a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment Notes  PINs  instead of cash. Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in cash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR. The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday  but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought to satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the notes would yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash. The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the new proposal. Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm support for the PINs proposal this week  which gave Ongpin hope that the banks would embrace the idea. But the banks are still being circumspect  weighing possible accounting consequences as well as considering the precedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS. One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal  U.S. lawyer Lee Buchheit  is adamant that the banks have nothing to worry about.  To the extent that it's a precedent  it's a precedent to be encouraged   Buchheit  a partner with Cleary  Gottlieb  Steen and Hamilton  told a debt-equity swaps conference sponsored by Euromoney magazine. Under the proposal  banks would sell the dollar-denominated PINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert them into pesos at face value to fund government-approved equity investments in the Philippines. In effect  international firms would be paying part of Manila's interest bill  allowing the government to conserve much-needed hard currency. One of the beauties of the scheme  according to Buchheit  is that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations  which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past 4-1/2 years.  There's another pool of cash at the table now   he said. David Mulford  Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury  told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be part of a  menu  of options available to banks instead of pure new-money packages. He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.  We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may  in effect  be essential to future bank syndications   Mulford said. In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal  he said that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program and criticism of communication and coordination within the bank syndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to participate in the loan. This refusal  for a time appeared to jeopardize the prospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks   Mulford said. The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20  but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new life into the financing process  especially with crucial negotiations with Brazil  about to start. The banks for their part insist that they are more than willing to discuss Mulford's  menu   and say it is the debtors that need to be more flexible. For example  they say financing talks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires dislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions that the banks are promoting. But whether the banks are ready to endorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told apress conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long.

Asked to comment on remarks by some U.S. Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar  Miyazawa said only the U.S. President and the U.S. Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates."
"2","Senior U.S. Economic officialsdisagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast  Rudolph Penner  Director of the Congressional Budget Office  said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto  which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it  to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable  Sprinkel said   It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.  He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate  adding   It looks like they're on track.  While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit  Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives  he said.  Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform   Sprinkel said.  In 1986  this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.  Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September  federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP  while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP  leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct  he said. Sprinkel said that  compared with fiscal 1978  the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.  Contrary to the conventional wisdom  therefore  the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years   Sprinkel said.  This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981   he added. However  the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.  Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress  indeed with increases in defence spending  now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant   he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the  biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history   which helped foster widespread distrust of government.  The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level   Penner said.  But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.  Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed.  I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it   Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures  such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets.  Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes  like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs   Penner said."

In a speech to the National Press Club  Hawke said business  must not puncture the spirit of community restraint  evident in low wage increases and suppressed consumer demand. Hawke said the Federal Government would coordinate with State administrations to monitor prices and profit margins.  At a time when a concerted national effort to restrain costs is required  profit margins should not be increased   he said. Direct price control did not appeal to the government  but it would act to ensure market forces operated fairly and businesses were reminded of their obligations to Australia  Hawke said. The government would demonstrate its commitment with spending cuts in its May 14 economic statement  he said. It would also limit increases in government excises normally indexed to inflation to about six pct  Hawke said."

Yeutter said  if nations do the right kinds of things in financial  monetary and tax policies  then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates  and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable.  But he said  on the other hand  that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation   It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment."
"2","President Reagan told a group ofsupporters his pledge to veto a tax hike is solid  adding   There will be no tax rate increase in the 100th Congress.  While he did not mention House Speaker Jim Wright by name  Reagan said that some members of Congress were urging that taxes be raised.  I'm sorry but that's just not going to happen   said Reagan.  We're not going to break faith with the American people.   I promise you  tax reform will go ahead as scheduled   the president added.  All these tax hike schemes have as much chance of flying as a dead duck   he said. Reagan combined his strongly-stated opposition to a tax hike with a warning to Congress to meet the deficit reduction targets set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget control law. Failure to do so  he said  would jeopardize a continuation of the current favorable economic climate."

"2","President Reagan for the first timeadmitted he was wrong to sell arms to Iran in an initiative which four months ago plunged him into the worst crisis of his six-year-old presidency. He made the admission in a weekly radio address while defending the role played by Secretary of State George Shultz and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the affair. He said:  In the case of the Iranian arms sale matter  both Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger advised me strongly not to pursue the initiative. I weighed their advice but decided in the end the initiative was worth the risk and went forward.   As we now know  it turned out they were right and I was wrong. But they discharged their responsibilities as my advisers and as my subordinates   he said. Since the scandal broke last November  Shultz and Weinberger have said they told Reagan of their opposition to the deal and were not fully informed of the effort  carried out by National Security Council members. They also said they were unaware of the diversion of millions of dollars in profits from the arms sales to the Nicaraguan contra rebels  who have been fighting the leftist Managua government for six years."
"2","West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg was quoted as saying a possible currency fraud at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> may affect government plans to sell its 20 pct stake in the carmaker this year.  It is all very unpleasant for us because we have decided to privatise the VW shares this year. We will now have to ask ourselves the question whether we can keep to this date   he told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview. Bild am Sonntag released the text ahead of publication Stoltenberg did not elaborate on the share sale. The West German government owns 20 pct of VW ordinary share capital and has said previously it plans to sell it either in 1987 or 1988. Stoltenberg told Bild am Sonntag the possible fraud showed there had  clearly been reprehensible criminal conduct below the level of the responsible management board.   I do not want to prejudge results but the immediate and serious question which poses itself is whether certain management board members have kept their areas of business under appropriate control   he was quoted as saying. VW said last week it had discovered possibly fraudulent currency transactions which could cost the company 480 mln marks and had asked state prosecutors to investigate. It said on Friday it had dismissed the head of its foreign exchange department  Burkhard Junger. VW also said it suspended six staff  including financial transfer department chief Guenther Borchert and the head of the central cash and currency clearing department  Siegfried Mueller."

He said Iranians should guard against internal dissent and try to prevent it in a situation where foreign powers aimed to  smash Islam...And destroy every one of us.  His audience at a Tehran mosque included President Ali Khamenei  Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Hojatoleslam Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  influential Speaker of the Majlis (Parliament) as well as military leaders  the radio said. It quoted Khomeini as saying:  Everybody around us is pursuing the aim of destroying us from within.

Urging support for Parliament and the armed forces  Khomeini said it was a  religious duty  to control negative feelings about others and to behave in a friendly way.  We must support the Majlis. The Majlis must take sides with the nation. We must support the government and it must serve the nation   he said.  We must support the armed forces...They  too  should support you.

It said IMF Managing director Michel Camdessus made the pledge during talks with Moi in Washington yesterday. Earlier this month  Moi told parliament Kenya would face a difficult balance of payments situation this year as a result of falling income from coffee exports and a higher oil import bill. Foreign bankers in Nairobi have said a new loan agreement with the IMF would be Kenya's first option for dealing with the expected deficit. According to KNA  Moi thanked Camdessus for the IMF's help to Kenya during difficult times in the past.  Mr Camdessus assured president Moi that the IMF would continue to give Kenya maximum help   it added. Moi pressed the U.S. To increase its level of aid to Kenya  which fell to 53 mln dlrs this year from 111 mln in 1984  and called for more U.S. Investment in the country."
"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer  in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews  said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil  well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia  the world's largest oil exporter  will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact  Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer  in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October  said:  I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.  Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.  We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified   he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.  As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December  Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement   he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait  but not sales from floating storage  Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia  in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11  said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.  Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability   he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of  swing producer  within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.  Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC   Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed  I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.  Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway  Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.  We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions   Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit."
"2","Finance Minister MohammedAli Abal-Khail said a committee will be set up to examine the problem of late government payments to contractors and companies operating in the kingdom. He told a working session on the first day of a businessmen's conference yesterday that the committee  made up of Finance Ministry and Chamber of Commerce officials  will be formed shortly. He said the committee will also investigate disputes between contractors and the government  but said the foreign press had to some extent exaggerated payments problems. Abal-Khail said   It is only natural that among those thousands of contracts some problems perpetrated by disputes over specifications  contractual obligations  project-handovers and duration of contracts arose.  Late payments  or in some cases total absence of payments  have been a major source of concern for both the Saudi private sector and foreign contractors operating in the kingdom. Businessmen said the minister's remarks were a rare admission of problems in the contract sector and the first concrete sign of government action to tackle payments delays."
"2","Philippines finance minister JaimeOngpin said he was cautiously optimistic an accord on debt rescheduling would be reached with commercial bank creditors  as he prepared for the third week of talks starting Monday.  One can never be too optimistic  but I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get an agreement....We think we're close to a deal   Ongpin told Reuters by telephone. He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late Friday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other members of the Philippine delegation. Ongpin declined to disclose details of the banks' new offer and bankers also declined to be specific ahead of their next meeting with Ongpin on Monday. But one senior banker said he too was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck  possibly by the end of the week. Still at the heart of the talks is Ongpin's offer to pay part of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment Notes  PINs  instead of cash. The bank creditors' advisory committee led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co rejected the concept as it was originally drafted  but the counter-proposal made on Friday contains a revised version  bankers said. Manila  seeking to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of its total debt of 27.2 billion  wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in cash and a margin above LIBOR in PINs. These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at a discount to multi-national firms which would then convert them at face value with the central bank  thus receiving subsidized pesos for use in funding government-approved investments. Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest margin above LIBOR. The Philippines would conserve foreign exchange and enjoy investment inflows  reducing marginally the need to seek new bank loans. But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original form  fearing regulatory and accounting problems. They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that interest should be paid in cash not paper  fearing that other debtor nations would emulate the idea  bankers said. Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing that his government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR if there was no buyer in the secondary market. Last week the banks came under pressure to accept this  when senior U.S. Officials endorsed it as fully consistent with Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy. But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was still a sticking point. After Venezuela clinched a revised rescheduling agreement last month at 7/8 pct over LIBOR  some New York bankers imediately claimed that 7/8 pct should be seen as a new benchmark for a debtor that needs no new loans  is current on interest and is repaying some principal. The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the third."
"2","New Zealand's inflation rate couldfall to eight pct in the coming year  Prime Minister David Lange said.

I predict it will be something between eight and 10 per cent   he told a news conference. Lange would not name the forecasting groups."

"2","A 250 mln dlr Philippine capital fundwill be launched shortly to encourage private sector investment  Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said in a report to President Corazon Aquino on his first year in office. The First Philippine Capital Fund will be launched jointly by New York investment house &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers> and the International Finance Corp  an affiliate of the World Bank  Ongpin said. He gave no date for the launch. Ongpin said the implementation of the fund had been delayed by his government's negotiations to reschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of its 27.8 billion dlr foreign debt. Craig Nalen  president of a U.S.-government backed Overseas Private Investment Corp mission which visited Manila in February  told reporters at the time the capital fund would amount to at least 100 mln dlrs. Ongpin proposed the 250 mln dlr fund during a trip to the United States last September. His plan called on private investors to raise funds to buy discounted obligations of Philippine borrowers from creditors and convert them to equity in local projects."
"2","Philippine government revenue isexpected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from 79.1 billion in 1986  Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said. In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's performance during the year ended February 28  Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year. He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs  adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987  up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986. Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details. He said treasury bill maturities  interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly.  In particular  short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985  are now down to less than 10 pct   he said. Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme  introduced in August last year  had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications  but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February. He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform. Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan. Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors. The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants."

"2","The Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton  repeated his criticism of City predators  describing them as  thoroughly irresponsible.   I have been concerned when predators have sought to use a minority shareholding to unsettle a perfectly well-managed company and to create an atmosphere in which a bid becomes daily expected   he said in a speech to the Industrial Society.  Such activity can amount to a thoroughly irresponsible exercise of shareholder power  and an abuse of the arrangements we have for the protection of shareholders' interests   he said. Leigh-Pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in a speech last week  when he attacked the practice of  putting a company into play.  This is when predators use a minority shareholding to force a company's management into action which will raise the company's share price. The predator then withdraws  taking substantial profits. In today's speech  Leigh-Pemberton said it was hard to find the right tightrope to walk between intervention and adherence to a free market philosophy."

Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons  Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries. Mulroney  who offered few new details of the talks  said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult   a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging.  In a 50-minute address  Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost.  Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades  we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising  one that is under-developed and under-employed   said Mulroney.  What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others  that they get their chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity.  Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners. Recent published reports in Canada  quoting senior trade sources  said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes  something that would give Canada protection from Washington's tough trade remedy laws. But Mulroney  sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S  said Canada was a  fair trader  and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market. He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.  We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal  one that is fair to both sides   Mulroney said."
"2","Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said hewas maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in retail prices for February. He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct  following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct. He said he was happy with  a good result  for February but stressed a need for continued  vigilance  against inflation. A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year differential between French and lower West German inflation rates  calculated on the last three months  had narrowed in February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January. If calculated on the last 12 months  the differential came to 3.9 pct  the statement said  adding  The tendency is therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main trading partner."
"2","The Securities and ExchangeCommission approved a request by two firms controlled by inside trader Ivan Boesky that allows them to take steps to protect hundreds of millions of dollars from potential claimants. The SEC granted requests made by Seemala Partners L.P. and IFB Managing Partnership L.P.  to withdraw as registered brokers  effective March 12. With the action  the partnerships are no longer subject to the SEC's net capital rules requiring them to remain solvent as brokerage firms. Seemala argued the move would be necessary if noteholders of Ivan Boesky and Co L.P. are to be repaid. In asking the SEC to speed its withdrawal as a registered broker  Seemala said it wold repay to Boesky and Co  which is also controlled by the former Wall Street arbitrageur  660 mln dlrs in subordinated debt  plus accrued interest. IFB Managing Partners  which was also given approval to withdraw as a broker  has no significant assets  the SEC said. Once it is repaid  Boesky and Co will pay 200 mln dlrs in senior participating notes and 440 mln dlrs in subordinated participating notes of Hudson Funding Corp to certain noteholders  Seemala told the SEC. Under the planned repayment scheme  Seemala told the SEC the noteholders would forgo claims of prepayment penalties and some additional interest amounting to more than 100 mln dlrs. The plan would be in the public interest  Seemala argued  since the noteholders  many of which are savings and loan institutions and insurance companies  would receive repayment of the principal on their notes. Seemala also argued that the plan would help the limited partners of Boesky and Co  who were not charged in the Boesky insider trading scandal  by protecting its remaining equity from the noteholders' claims. Unless the Boesky firms are allowed to complete the repayment plan  Seemala said Boesky and Co noteholders would seek total claims of 116.8 mln dlrs  plus 9.2 mln dlrs to 10.6 mln dlrs a month in addition  in addition to other claims. Such claims could wipe out Boesky and Co's assets before other creditors can establish their claims  Seemala said. The only opposition to Seemala's Feb 12 request to withdraw as a broker came from Berger and Montague P.C.  counsel for the plaintiffs in a class action suit against Seemala and other defendants. The suit involves charges stemming from Boesky's insider trading in the stock of several major companies. Berger and Montague told the SEC it opposes the Seemala proposal because it would allow Boesky and Co noteholders to settle their claims ahead of the plaintiffs in the class action and because Seemala did not disclose the total amount of claims against it and what percentage defrauded investors would get. Seemala has said that its repayment scheme would leave a pool of about 278 mln dlrs free of claims from Boesky and Co noteholders which could satisfy other claimants. The pool would be in addition to funds placed in escrow under insider trading settlement agreements  including 11.4 mln dlrs from Dennis Levine and 50 mln dlrs from Boesky. In approving the request  the SEC barred Seemala and Boesky and Co from making any distributions to its limited partners for one year and required limited partners who receive distributions to agree to make themselves liabile up to a point in any case filed the partnerships. The SEC also required Seemala and Boesky and Co to get confirmation of their assets from a nationally recognized accounting firm. The agency said Boesky and Co and existing and potential claimants against it have similar interests in eliminating major creditors and preserving assets for future claims."

I think Congress is moving in the direction of the president   he told Reuters as he was about to address a meeting of the Federal Managers Association. He did not elaborate on this but said a reported agreement by House and Senate budget writers calling for about 36 billion dlrs in deficit cuts was  six billion too short.  The administration proposed 42 billion dlrs in deficit reductions."
"2","West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker met Argentine President Raul Alfonsin for talks on the first day of the German leader's four-day visit. Local officials placed great importance on the meeting because Weizsaecker is considered a key backer here for more flexible repyament terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr foreign debt.  I suppose (the debt) will be unavoidable  in talks  said Juan Carlos Pugliese  speaker of the lower house of the Argentine Parliament and one of Alfonsin's top political allies  before the meeting. He said that  Germany in particular and most European countries  have supported more liberal repyament terms for Argentina's debt  Latin America's third largest. An Argentine mission is now in the United States concluding negotiations on debt repyayment with 11 creditor banks."
"2","A high-level meeting last week whichincluded the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA officials  along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups  failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level  participants at the meeting told Reuters.  We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week  but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary  and he didn't close the door on anything   a member of the soybean delegation said. At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn. But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn  soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers. Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting  but participants would not reveal what those options were.  There were no surprises in our package   one participant said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates. The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash. This would have the effect of lowering the world price  maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government's soybean inventory. A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last week's meeting  participants said. One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a  listening session  for USDA  and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department. USDA officials  however  would not commit to any time frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future.  USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could influence the market  so the Secretary was very non-committal   a participant said."
"2","Corporate raider Carl Icahnacknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws. Icahn  who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA>  made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group. The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12  1986  Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons  including Icahn  violated securities laws and related rules  Icahn said. Specifically  the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies  he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements  to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes  but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC  which is obviously already aware of its own probe  Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal  according to published reports. Making late filings of 13D forms  which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company  or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to  warehouse  shares of stock. In a warehousing scheme  a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert. Last year  the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc."

Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves. EC External Trade Commissioner  Willy De Clercq has already written to his U.S. counterpart  special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter  outlining the EC's concerns. The ministers' said they were  very disturbed  by the U.S. moves  adding   the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations.

"2","Latin America urgently needs more moneyif it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis  but fresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem to be in short supply. Bankers  officials and academics at a conference organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stressed the importance of proper economic policies and increased private investment. But they offered no glimpse of a grand design to banish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's 380 billion dlr debt.  Such a solution is still not in sight   said Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani. The conference was held against the background of the recent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador  but it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn who spelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused by the need to service billions of dlrs of debt. Brodersohn  who is negotiating currently with foreign banks for a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987  says Argentina will have to grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply to restore per capita income to the level of 1975. He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come partly from structural economic reforms at home  but this alone will not be enough.  We have to reduce the transfer of resources   Brodersohn said  adding that mounting economic strains in Latin America make this a matter of urgency. Brodersohn and other Latin officials  however  did not spell out how this should be achieved. The creditors' strategy  spelled out by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker in October 1985  is to spur additional lending by private banks and multilateral development banks in return for economic reforms. But there was a widespread recognition at the conference that the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations. Miguel Urrutia  a senior official of the Inter-American Development Bank  for instance  said IADB lending had actually declined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987. Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday that will be the first major facility under the Baker Plan  which called for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988  a target that Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund said is now optimistic. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan  has not yet succeeded as well as we hoped.  But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an official commitment to try a new tack  they must have been disappoiunted. Ted Truman  director of the International Finance Diviision at the Federal Reserve Board  said banks were short-sighted in not lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker. He said some streamlining of the lending process may be needed  but added   I see no alterantive to the present course of responsible cooperation.  A major theme at the conference  however  was that the world economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors and creditors muddle along. If export markets dry up because of recession or protectionism  speakers warned  Latin America will be even more hard-pressed to service its debts. Rimmer de Vries  chief international economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co  said he was very concerned that world economic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and that West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in the world economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its trade deficit.  There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain  and I don't know who's going to be rolled over   de Vries said. He called for a new lending initiative with a wide menu of options as alternatives to pure new money.  Can we not manage this lending a bit more imaginatively?  he asked the conference. But new ideas take time to devise and implement  and Brazil's suspension of interest payments shows that the aptience of debtors might be wearing thin. Persio Arida  a former director of the Brazizlian central bank who was a key architect of that country's Cruzado plan to curb inflation  said there is an  incentive problem  throughout Latin America."

The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than 1 000 billion yen. The Government is working on a provisional budget as the chances of passing a full one by April 1 are virtually nil as a result of the halt in parliamentary business  officials said.

"2","Prime Minister Poul Schlueter saidthe downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by the U.S. Standard and Poor's Corp was regrettable but of little practical importance. 3tandard and Poor's yesterday lowered the rating on Danish long-term external debt to AA from AA-plus  saying Denmark was less competitive with rising labour costs and this would worsen the external account deficit and increase external debt. Schlueter told journalists after the weekly cabinet meeting:  It is regrettable that they have taken a plus from us  but the change will not have much practical significance.  He was echoing comments by central bank governor Erik Hoffmeyer  who was quoted by the daily Politiken as saying the downgrading would have little effect on Denmark's borrowing capability or the interest it paid on loans. But some bank economists said the lower rating would increase the cost of national borrowing to finance the external current account deficit  which rose to a record 34.5 billion crowns in 1986. Denmark had total foreign debt of over 260 mln crowns at the end of 1986. Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said in a statement last night that the downgrading  the second in four years  should not be over-dramatised  pointing out that the government had already imposed a series of austerity measures to limit consumption and was willing to act again if necessary. Prices fell steeply when the Danish bond market opened but recovered somewhat after the central bank cut the overnight money market lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The bank said the cut was due to an inflow of foreign currency in March  following stabler currency relations after January's EMS realignment."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker urgedCongress to support the administration's financing requests for the multilateral development banks in the next two fiscal years. Baker told a House appropriations subcommittee the administration's request for a total 2.1 billion dlrs in fiscal 1987 and 1988 would meet administration shortfalls and fulfill Washington's annual payment responsibilities. In testimony that went over much of the same ground as his remarks to a Senate committee some two weeks ago  Baker said support for the MDBs was crucial to U.S. economic leadership. Baker told the committee   Our national self respect and our international leadership depend on our willingness to fulfill this responsibility.  The administration budget requests include a supplemental request for fiscal 1987 of 293 mln dlrs and a 1.8 billion dlr request for fiscal 1988. Baker noted these requests included funding requirements negotiated by the administration with this committee. Baker's remarks outlined why the development banks were formed and the stake the U.S. had in maintaining them. Baker pointed out the U.S. has successfully sought reforms in several of the institutions and was pressing for reforms in others aimed at making them more efficient  with policies oriented toward free markets. He also gave the House subcommittee a progress report on the debt strategy and emphasized the importance of continued financing for the MDBs if the U.S. is to continue to lead in resolving the debt crisis. In other remarks  Baker repeated the need to finance the general foreign affairs budget and underscored how MDBs have served U.S. national interests."
"2","President Reagan  ending four monthsof semi-isolation from the press  will hold a televised news conference on Thursday  the White House said. Reagan is certain to be questioned extensively at the 2000 EST/0100 gmt session about the secret sale of arms to Iran and skimming of profits to aid U.S.-backed  contra  rebels in Nicaragua. During his last news conference on November 19  1986 -- six days before the fund diversion came to light -- Reagan strongly defended the clandestine arms operation. During that session  the president also denied any third country involvement in the Iran initiative even though it was already known that Israel had played a key role in the arms shipments. The White House was forced to issue a correction following the news conference. Reagan's fumbling performance in that encounter with reporters helped contribute to a sharp decline in his job approval rating in various public opinion polls. Since the November 19 news conference  Reagan --who maintains he knew nothing about the contra diversion -- has revised his position on his covert Iran policy."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker while defending the progress of his 1985 debt initiative  conceded that lending by commercial banks to developing countries has not gone as fast as the administration would have liked. In testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee  Baker said  however   I think it is wrong to say that (commercial bank lending) has not occured in a meaningful way.  He added though that it has not  materialized as fast as we would have liked.  The Treasury secretary also said that it would be politically wrong for the United States or other countries to guarantee loans made by commercial banks to the developing country debtors because that would be  rightly perceived as a bank bailout.  Baker also said that it would be impractical for governments to mandate bank lending to the third world since this would have the eventual impact of turning commercial banks away from making all loans to the region."
"2","Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson  presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament  said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg  after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year  Lawson said.  As I forecast in the Autumn Statement  inflation may continue to edge up for a time  perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer  before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year   he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)  Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg  or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy  Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate  he said.  But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions  as of course will the exchange rate   the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87  is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general  and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.  On oil prices  Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said  it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues  coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure  puts the public finances in a very strong position.  Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future.  We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead   Lawson said.  Inevitably  this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation  which of course remains a major objective of government policy.   But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution  and to build a still firmer base for the future.  Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax  he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the  appropriate corporation tax rate.  He said that under the new proposed system  companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains.  Taken together  these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89   Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax   with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.   I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax  to be known as Pay and File.  This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection  and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today  companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields  until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second  there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment  Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future  traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days  he added  and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21 300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance  he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125 000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1  1987  but  genuine trading companies  will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans  also from April 1.  In future  banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan   he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence  to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound  but added  given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR  that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.  Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct  he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market  Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates  bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation  he said.  The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year   Lawson said. MORE &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"

"2","West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl hasinvited the European Community's 17-man Commission for talks in Bonn next month in a bid to repair strained relations  EC diplomats said. The Commissioners  led by President Jacques Delors  will pay a two-day visit to Bonn on April 1-2 when they were due for a meeting with the principal West German cabinet members. The meeting  the first of its kind between the Commission and the government of a member state  was originally meant to focus on problems posed by West Germany's federal constitution. But they said the meeting was now likely to be dominated by Commission plans to restructure the EC's exhausted finances and its costly farm policy  which have provoked strong opposition from Bonn. Kohl has written two letters to Delors  complaining that the plans would hit West German farmers hard.  His farm minister Ignaze Kiechle has publicly criticised the two German members of the Commission for failing to oppose them. This caused protest from Brussels where the Commission tries to guard the independence of its members from the governments that nominate them."

"2","Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson  presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament  said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg  after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987  he said  adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87  Lawson said. Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply  Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate. The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general  and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular. On oil prices  Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future  he said."

"2","Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oilproducers  announced today  are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry  the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today  companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date  full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself  when its income stream began  but was not immediately available against other development expenditure  the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today  and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed  it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf  which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred  to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field  the Inland Revenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures  and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs  it said. In due course  the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year  it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced  while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called  ring fence  of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November  it said. Gareth Lewis Davies  a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh  thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey  Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged  he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry  which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created  as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry  although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year."

The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil  but makes no recommendations.

Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that  although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years  this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.  The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September  citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel  referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.

The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviously one of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about  but they haven't any agenda as far as I know   Lyng's aide said. Private industry export officials have met periodically with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation. Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is uncertain  the aide said.  I don't know what they'll tell us that we don't already knwo  but we'll hear what they have to say   Lyng's aide said.

"2","Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35 000 barrels per day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100 000 barrels a day. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve  but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate  but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make  he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption  posing a serious economic and national security threat."

"2","The budget presented by Chancellor ofthe Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as being politically astute  combining tax cuts and fiscal prudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's standing with both voters and financial markets. The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the standard rate of tax  and a three billion stg reduction in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)  to 4.0 billion stg. Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a fall in domestic interest rates and an early election. Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget  is not glamourous - but it is sound and sensible.  Lawson told journalists later that it was  a budget built on success  for success.  But opposition MPs did not agree . David Steel  leader of the Liberal Party  said  this was a strangely deceptive budget. The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has chosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR  whereas we in the SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use those revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty.  Steel said  the cunning thing in this seductive budget is that all the good things will come in the pre-election period - the fall in interest rates  the fall in mortgage rates  the lower income tax  relatively cheaper whisky  beer  cigarettes and petrol.  David Owen  the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping  said  this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it has failed in its objective. It has given money to the  haves  as opposed to the  have-nots.  Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it  a bribes budget.  Kinnock said the budget  had little to do with the general good  and everything to do with the general election.  Roy Hattersley  the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman  said  the Tories should have used available resources to invest in industry  in health and in education.  He added that  we know that whoever is elected (to power in the next general election) will reverse these tax cuts.  But Lawson rejected that. Rather  he said the Treasury expected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for use in cutting taxes or raising public spending. Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the government would be forced to call an election by a deteriorating economy. In his financial statement to Parliament  Lawson had said that  the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than it has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh year of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been combined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and strong  and unemployment is falling.  He said that  these are the fruits of the government's determination  in bad times as well as good  to hold firmly to our policies of sound money and free markets.  Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to plump for an early election. Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would have on election timing  he replied  I think we will hold the election either late or early. I must confess I am rather relaxed about it all.  There is not any compulsion to go for an early election. But he added that  if the Prime Minister decides to go for an early election  it will bring to an end all this rather ridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is something to be said for that.  Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of British Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said  This budget will reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing means lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI wanted.   We have always said we would judge the budget on how it affects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick."
"2","House Ways and Means Committeechairman Dan Rostenkowski said he was ready to support an 18 billion dlr tax increase to help balance the budget but doubted it could pass Congress without President Reagan's support. Rostenkowski  the chief House taxwriter  said his committee was reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that it would pass the full House and this would require Republican votes.  Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unless the president signs on   the Illinois Democrat said in remarks for delivery to the Tax Executives Institute. Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate on increases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income tax intact. The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income tax rate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in 1988  he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct next year. In addition  he said  they don't have the energy or appetite to endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax)   which he also opposes.  The real question is where the Republicans will be when the tough vote comes   he said. Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax credits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or trade bill this year. He added that no extension or expansion of the research and development tax credit for business is expected since it would cost billions of dollars. And  Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Baker as Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the White House will ultimately back a tax increase this year.  There are strong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the president down the slippery slope of moderation   he said."
"2","The Senate Budget Committee  at itsfirst budget drafting meeting of the year  discarded President Reagan's economic assumptions upon which he claims his budget would show a 108 billion dlr deficit. In its place  the committee agreed to accept the non partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic assumptions in its deliberations for drafting a 1988 budget. The CBO says Reagan's budget--even if it were adopted without change --would show a 134.4 billion dlr deficit in fiscal 1988 and thereby miss the Gramm-Rudman budget law target of 108 billion dlrs."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told representatives of several of the largest grain exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a position to comment on their request that the Reagan administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union  according to participants in today's meeting.  He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the Soviet Union   said Glen Hofer  vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. Another participant in the meeting  who asked not to be identified  said Lyng was  unresponsive  to the group's request. Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc  Continental Grain Co  Louis Dreyfus Corp  Union Equity Cooperative Exchange  the National Association of Wheat Growers  the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives  among others  participants said. Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting. Hofer described Lyng as  sympathetic but noncommittal   and said he thought he detected  a sense of frustration  on Lyng's part at not being able to respond more positively to the group's urging. A grain industry representative said some participants were  puzzled  by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.  There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been   this official  who asked not to be identified  said  referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. This official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP offer to Moscow. Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an offer  this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject. But Hofer said other important matters at the White House  rather than an absence of political pressure  might have restrained Lyng."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said he expected British interest rates to fall soon in response to his fiscal 1987/88 budget  but he did not say by how much.  I would be very surprised if there is not a very early further fall in interest rates   Lawson said in a radio interview. Analysts said they foresaw U.K. Base rates falling as early as today by as much as one full percentage point after Lawson's announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing requirement in fiscal 1987/88 and 1988/89 was to fall to 1.0 pct of GDP  or some four billion stg. British banks' base lending rates fell a half percentage point on March 9 to the current 10.5 pct."
"2","West German finance minister GerhardStoltenberg suggested that the U.K. Should join the European Monetary System (EMS) and also urged some member countries to abandon their dual currency structures. Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee for a Currency Union in Europe  whose key members are former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing  founders of the EMS. He said   One failing of the EMS is important countries  like Great Britain  are not members. Other partners should give up their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations.  EMS member Belgium has both a  financial  and a  commercial  franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct against other member currencies  compared with a permitted fluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies. According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech  the finance minister also urged greater convergence of economic and financial policies among European countries. He added that monetary stability should be a priority for European countries and  with reference to the U.S. Dollar  he said it was wrong to presume that a  permanent devaluation  was the answer to economic problems. Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the dollar in 1985.  But an overshooting in the other direction now brings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. And other countries whose currencies have declined   he added. He said such a development could also produce further burdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreement last month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise the dollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks  he said."
"2","Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct. However  he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates  although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly. He told a briefing of economic journalists that  I don't think we should rush anything.  Lawson stressed the themes of  gradualism and steadiness  as economic policy. Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88  unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP. Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates  both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines  were  perfectly consistent  with monetary conditions now in Britain. He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was  safely inside  its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget  Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3. Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS)  Lawson repeated that  it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election.  He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls. Although Lawson denounced what he said was  the current wave of election fever  in Britain  he added:   It is more likely that there will be an election this year  than not. He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air.  Ideally  we (the government) should have a full term   but events could force a premature poll  Lawson said. The government  which has been in power since 1979  must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election  political sources said. The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88  was the right balance  economically and politically   he said. Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts  who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move. But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which  while advancing towards that aim  could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate. Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg. Returning to changing levels of interest rates  Lawson stressed that  they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy.  Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels  he said. But  there may be interest rate consequences  from changes in the level of government borrowing  he added. Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain. He said conditions created by London's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries. Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain  Lawson said. First  control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone  due to the freedom of its financial markets. He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party. Thirdly  he said  we do not have as long a track record of low inflation  as did the U.S.  Japan and West Germany. Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent financial centre  because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo."

As part of this study  I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review   Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing. The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75 000 barrels of oil per day to 35 000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money.  My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor the maximum fill rate (of 100 000 bpd)   Herrington said."

The announcement said the administration will request from Congress 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern Canada. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration had asked for 350 mln dlrs but that Ottawa had registered concern about the level of funding. He said the announcement was  obviously related  to an April-5-6 summit meeting in Ottawa between Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Reagan said that in addition to committing government money industry would be encouraged to invest a greatwer or equal amount to promote new technologies to cut air pollution. The announcement said an advisory panel  including state governmments and the canadian government  would advise on funding and selection of polllution control projects. Further  a presidential task force on regulatory relief would examine the effect of federal  state and local regulations on deployment of new emission control technologies."
"2","Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration.  These options boost production  while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee   Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing.  It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.   The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day   he said. The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports.  We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995   Herrington said."
"2","The Canadian government welcomedPresident Reagan's announcement that he would seek 2.5 billion dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.  This action on the part of the U.S. administration serves well our ultimate objective of a bilateral accord providing for a common resolution of this serious environment problem   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in a statement. Environment Minister Tom McMillan said the Reagan announcement was a major step toward elimination of acid rain and that Canada was pleased with the U.S. decision. The Reagan announcement earlier today said the administration would ask Congress to approve 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Canada has been pressing the Reagan administration to live up to a commitment made last year for 5 billion dlrs in spending by the U.S. government and industry to cut toxic emissions that cause acid rain. The acid rain issue has been the major irritant in Canada-U.S. relations for several years  with Ottawa accusing Washington of failing to act on the issue."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker andFederal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker have told House leaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work  but acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the worse  Congressional sources and U.S. officials said. Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks yesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders. But the two architects of the Third World debt strategy gave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote economic growth and reform.  They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs   one participant at the meeting said. However Baker and Volcker  accompanied by Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead  acknowledged there were risks.  And if things turned sour  they could turn very sour   a source quoted them as saying. They were responding to questions from Wright  a Texas Democrat  who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his concern the debt crisis was deepening  an aide said. The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin American democracy and the danger that demagogues of either left or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments. Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing more confidence in an optimistic outcome  Volcker was especially concerned about the political risks  and in particular the fatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolving the debt crisis would be a  struggle . Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year  Wright has shown himself an able political adversary of the administration on budget strategy. His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that Congressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more seriously now than in the past. More worrisome for administration strategists is the possibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially granting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.  When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office  they knew it wasn't just talk   one source at the meeting said. The two economic policymakers listened patiently to descriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility  backed by gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund. The agency could buy up or guarantee developing country debt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking economic reforms. The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countries for their views under a bill approved by a House Banking subcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce  a New York House Democrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by Bruce Morrison  a House Democrat from Connecticut. The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leaders also attended the discussions. U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by the administration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterday the concept of debt relief was misguided.  If we write it all off and declare defeat  these countries will decay and wither on the vine   the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital inflows that would follow debt relief. Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new innovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors. Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985  calling on commercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major debtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.  They sat down together to discuss the implications for Latin America and feel each other out on the best way out   a Wright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect the dialogue to continue. The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and an uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister  Dilson Funaro  after talks with western leaders. Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power over the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister Joao Sayad is further reason to worry. Another proposal  to allow regulators to grant commercial banks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans  has been presented by Senator Bill Bradley  a New Jersey Democrat  but did not come up yesterday. Wright  who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt   is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin American issue  at least on the surface appears to be a new danger   said an aide  who asked not to be named. There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance by commercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors following substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials. At the State Department  Secretary of State George Shultz is being advised the  Baker plan is going through a rough patch  while Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt more flexible approaches to guarantee their continued participation in the plan."
"2","President Reagan has sent Congressproposals to streamline high-tech export control procedures  the White House said.  These proposals are part of the president's energetic program to enhance America's competitiveness in the world economy   it said in a written statement. It said the proposals included exempting from license requirements a number of low technology items and allowing foreign manufacturers to re-export U.S. parts and components up to a certain level without U.S. government re-export authorization."
"2","Indonesia cannot spend its way out ofrecession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices  Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.  If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much  such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies  it might create negative effects not only on price increases  but also on the balance of payments   he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan. Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit. Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries  which are centered in Sumatra.  I see Sumatra has great potential  as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number   he said  according to the agency. Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices. It has projected its current account deficit will widen to over four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending March 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86."
"2","Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg saidhe was looking for ways to help finance a planned tax reform without increasing value-added tax but could not rule out raising some indirect taxes  for example  on tobacco. Stoltenberg also told parliament that closing tax loopholes would contribute towards the 19 billion marks the government is seeking to finance part of its 44 billion mark tax reform package for the 1990s. He confirmed that a temporary and limited increase in the borrowing requirement was also being considered. Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said a temporary rise in borrowing was acceptable but stressed his government would exercise strict discipline in spending. New net borrowing was 23.0 billion marks in 1986 compared with 37.2 billion in 1982."
"2","There is no question of stimulatingconsumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy  sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said. Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin  who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of  relaunching  the economy. This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn  but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move. The sources today said the government's policy remained one of  recovery   or sound finances and greater efficiency. They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital  21.4 billion francs  or two-thirds  will go toward paying off national debt. Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions  they added. The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country's internal debt  expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1 300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5 000 billion francs last year  broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct. The sources said that with France's economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners  the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies."
"2","Jefferies Group Inc said founderand chairman Boyd L. Jefferies has resigned and intends to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities laws. The company said neither Boyd Jefferies nor the company ever engaged in insider trading and neither he nor the company ever sought or communicated insider information or violated ny trust of confidence placed in them by customers.  It said no governmental authority has ever alleged any such activity on Boyd Jefferies' part or the part of the company. The company said Boyd Jefferies has consented to an administrative order barring him from the securities business for at least five years and he has agreed to place his 13 pct holding in Jefferies Group stock in a voting trust during that period. The company said  without admitting any allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission  Boyd Jefferies  Jefferies Group and primary brokerage subsidiary Jefferies and Co also consented to an injunction barring any future securities laws violations. It said Jefferies and Co has agreed further to undertake reviews to assure that its internal recordkeeping and other control systems are in compliance with federal laws. The company said president and chief operating officer Frank E. Baxter will assume the added duties of chief executive officer.  Boyd Jefferies had been chief executive. The company said the criminal charges against Boy Jefferies resulted from a transaction in which  on behalf of Jefferies and Co  he agreed to purchase stocks from entities controlled by Ivan F. Boesky and later resell the stock to the Boesky firms. It said  Within days of the purchase  the market value of one of the stocks fell sharply and  pursuant to their agreement  a Boesky entity paid Jefferies and Co three mln dlrs to offset the loss. The company said Boyd Jefferies will admit that following the loss he ordered that Boesky receive a bill for three mln dlrs for investment advisory and corporate finance services  although Jefferies and Co treated the three mln dlrs as an offset to the losses it experienced. It said by rendering the involice  Boyd Jefferies apparently enabled one of the Boesky entities to make a false entry in its books  resulting in the charge  to which Boyd Jefferies will plead guilty  of aiding and abetting one of the Boesky firms in making false entries on its books. The company said Boyd Jefferies will also plead guilty to a margin violation resulting from a transaction in which he caused Jefferies and Co to buy shares at the request of a customer in the company's trading account. It was expected that the customer would be responsible for any loss on the shares and would also receive any profit  and because the customer had not put up any funds for the purchase  Boyd Jefferies had in effect caused Jefferies and Co to finance the full purchase price for the shares in violation of margin requirements  the company said. The company quoted Boyd Jefferies as saying   I fully accept sole responsibility for these transactions.  I think it is appropriate that I suffer the consequences for my actions rather than the company.  Jefferies Group said it expects no impact on its operations or client base from Boyd Jefferies' departure."
"2","Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production. The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code. Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year. The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday. Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option:  that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.  He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U.S. economy."
"2","Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years. He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production  not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. On the grounds of increasing production  he said   I would rule out a gasoline tax.  Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400 000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs. He said an increased depletion allowance  to 27.5 pct  on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production. He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year. Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool. The White House said it would study the proposal  but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code  just passed last year. Herrington  asked his reaction to the White House reaction  said   If I were the White House  I would be cool  too."
"2","Federal regulators said BoydJefferies  who resigned as head of his Los Angeles brokerage firm  took part in schemes to manipulate the price of a stock and in a stock  parking  plot with inside trader Ivan Boesky. In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York  the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferies agreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up a large chunk of stock being issued in a public offering. Under the agreement  the firm  Jefferies and Co  drove the price of the stock up by one-eighth point by buying four blocks of the stock at or near the close of trading  the SEC said. Jefferies and Co's purchases of the unidentified stock accounted for 66 pct of the total trading volume of the stock on that day and were aimed at manipulation  the SEC said. The complaint did not identify the company whose stock was being traded  but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases took place sometime last year when another unidentified company  which owned a controlling interest in the company  sold several million shares of the stock in a secondary public offering. The stock purchases were made on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange  the SEC said. The person who made the alleged stock manipulation agreement with Jefferies was also not identified. But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in a phony invoice marked for investment banking services for the exact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold the stock on the open market  the SEC said. The payment  the amount of which was also not revealed in the complaint  was made later by another unidentified person after Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount  the SEC said. The firm recorded the payment as  other income   it said. William McLucas  associate director of enforcement at the SEC  declined to say why the agency decided against revealing the identities of other persons and companies involved in the stock manipulation scheme.  We just made a determination that this was the way to go at this time   McLucas told Reuters. The complaint went into far greater detail in its charges that Jefferies agreed with Boesky to  park  stock at each other's firms. Parking  or warehousing  stock  refers to deals where stock is held by one person or firm under an arrangement where it is actually under the control of someone else. Under the agreement between Jefferies and Boesky  Jefferies and Co would hold stock owned by Seemala Corp  one of Boesky's brokerage firms  for 31 days  after which Seemala would  buy  the stock back  the SEC said. Seemala realized all gains and sustained all losses on the stock held by Jefferies and Co during the period  agreed to compensate Jefferies and Co for carrying the stock and to pay more than twice Jefferies and Co's usual commission  it said. Seemala then agreed to hold stock owned by Jefferies and Co for a month under terms about the same as the deal in which Seemala agreed to park its stock at Jefferies and Co  it said. The agreement  which violated several securities laws  allowed Seemala to create a false appearance that no longer held the stock and could meet the SEC's net capital requirements  the SEC said. Jefferies wanted Seemala to hold some of its stock  the SEC said  so that Jefferies and Co could meet its net capital needs  the agency said. On March 12  1985  Seemala  sold  Jefferies 810 000 shares oc Cooper Laboratories Inc for 11.7 mln dlrs  600 000 shares of Southland Financial Corp for 17.3 mln dlrs and 500 000 shares of G.D. Searle and Co for 27.1 mln dlrs  it said. On March 20  Jefferies and Co  sold  Seemala 185 500 shares of American Broadcasting Co for 19.6 mln dlrs  210 000 shares of Ideal Basic Industries Inc for 2.9 mln dlrs  300 000 shares of ITT Corp for 9.8 mln dlrs  105 000 shares of Phillips Petroleum Co for 4.0 mln dlrs  70 000 shares of Pioneer Corp for 2.1 mln dlrs and 300 000 shares of Texas Oil and Gas Corp for 5.3 mln dlrs  the SEC said. The value of Seemala's stock at the time of the transfers was 56 mln dlrs  while Jefferies and Co's stock was worth 43 mln dlrs at the time  the SEC said. Within a month  Seemala and Jefferies and Co unwound most of the stock transfers with each others firms  the SEC said. But a major hitch developed in the deal when the price of Searle stock  which Jefferies and Co was holding for Seemala  dipped sharply  it said. On March 26 Seemala  bought  back its Searle stock for 23.4 mln dlrs  resulting in a 3.6 mln dlr loss for Jefferies and Co  the SEC said. Seemala then allowed Jefferies and Co to  buy  back some it the stock Seemala was holding for it at a 647 812 dlr gain and Boesky's firms later paid the Jefferies firm three mln dlrs  which it called  fees   it said. Among the violations Jefferies committed in the schemes  were net capital  record keeping  public disclosure and margin requirements  the SEC said. Under the settlement of the civil SEC's charges  which was announced simultaneously with the filing of the complaint  Jefferies and his firm did not have to admit or deny guilt. But they agreed to a court order barring them from further securities law violations. Jefferies also agreed to get out of the securities business for at least five years."
"2","Beryl Sprinkel  chairman ofthe president's council of economic advisors  said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines.  Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation   he told the Futures Industry Association. Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period.  Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery   he said. Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners  he said recent figures showed Japan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986   Not enough to sustain employment growth.  However  Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies  including tax reform.  I suspect there will be further moves   he said. Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases.  Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform   he said  adding that  a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform.  Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated. However  he said that  sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable   as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad.  I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987   he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance  he said  will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present  serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.  Western Europe  where manufactures output and employment have been weak  promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance  Sprinkel said. He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them."
"2","Council of Economic AdvisersChairman Beryl Sprinkel called on Latin American governments to adopt sounder economic policies and said U.S. banks' loans to those countries had already been written down in an economic sense.  Latin governments will have to adopt policies that promote growth for their own citizens   he said  adding that the record has been mixed. Brazil  he said  recently has backtracked from better economic policies and  obviously they have to change.  Asked if U.S. banks ultimately would be forced to write down portions of their loans to Latin America  Sprinkel said   In any realistic sense  economic sense  those loans have been written down.  The banks could not sell the loans at par  he said  and the price/earnings ratio of major banks' stocks has not been doing very well.  Clearly the lenders have suffered   said Sprinkel."
"2","Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan packagewill be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls from both creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuous process of raising such jumbo loans  bankers said. Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican deal has been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared. Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and even now  five months after the loan was agreed with a 13-bank advisory committee on October 16  dozens of Mexico's some 400 creditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate. The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the fact that it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor since the region's debt crisis flared up in 1983. Mexico will also sign agreements to reschedule 52.3 billion dlrs of debt. Moreover  as the first major package built on U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's strategy of offering loans to countries willing to implement market-oriented  pro-growth policies  intense market scrutiny was only to be expected. Still  the split within the banks' ranks came as a shock.  This is not an unsuccessful operation  but we've had more bickering than ever   one senior banker commented. Officers at small banks that have sold  swapped or or written down their Mexican loans say they see no reason why they should throw good money after bad. Major lenders counter that small banks must share the responsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keep receiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones. Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said recently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangered the entire Mexican package. Things have improved  but money center bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrant banks even once the 7.7 billion dlr target has been reached. The loan presently is about 98.5 pct committed.  People who are outside shouldn't think they've been saved once we get over 7.7 (billion dlrs)   one warned. But rounding up  free-rider  banks entails such a huge drain on management resources that more and more bankers are acknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink. One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis of current exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier  base  date - August 1982 in the case of Mexico. Another streamlining idea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loans for  exit bonds  that a debtor would issue at a discount. Argentina has pressed for this solution  so far to no avail  arguing that the smallest 120 of its 360 bank creditors account for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that the next 120 banks account only for a further six pct. Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentina may not receive the 2.15 billion dlrs in bank loans it is seeking until September  which would be a year after negotiations began with the International Monetary Fund. The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence of investors in Argentina  forcing up interest rates and spurring capital flight  he said.  We have to introduce some common sense into the discussion   Machinea said this week in Cambridge  Mass. He was echoed by Mexico's deputy planning minister  Pedro Aspe Armella  who said the delay in signing his country's loan has made it difficult to map economic policy with any certainty.  It's a sad affair   he told the Cambridge meeting. Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay in the loan that it suspended its debt-equity swap program last month to put pressure on the banks. Other strains have intensified between U.S. and non-U.S. banks  partly because U.S. regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns. Critics say this prompts U.S. banks to focus too much on ensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the short term  possibly to the detriment of longer-term solutions. Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexican deal are American  some foreign bankers think other U.S. banks should make up the difference. This issue of  national share  was defused on the Mexican committee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks with Argentina and Brazil  whose finance minister Dilson Funaro has already suggested separate negotiations with regional committees of creditors. Streamlining of the new-money process is running parallel with efforts to develop a broader  menu  of alternatives to new loans  such as trade credits or debt-equity conversions.  We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may  in effect  be essential to future bank syndications   Mulford said last week. He told the banks to stop complaining that there is no leeway in current procedures and to come up with ideas. Some steps have already been taken - interest payments for Chile have been stretched out and banks are debating whether to accept partial interest payments from the Philippines in paper instead of cash. Because the banks want to isolate hard-line Brazil by clinching a deal with Argentina as soon as practicable  bankers said the Argentine package is likely to be along the established lines of the Baker Plan. But some bankers are speculating that the Brazilian deal  when it comes  will be radically different. As such  the loan for Mexico could go down in the history books as the biggest but also the last jumbo.  I'm convinced it'll be the last one in this form   one banker said."

I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers) thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think they are very satisfied with the present level.

"2","President Ronald Reagan said hewould veto any tax increases voted by Congress.  My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid   Reagan said during a televised news conference. The president said he opposed efforts by some members of Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  It's time Congress cut the federal budget and left the family budget alone   Reagan said. He said the congressional budget process was in desperate need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S. constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.  This yearly deficit feeding process must stop   he added.  We must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  In the meantime  he said  Congress cannot back away from the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said."
"2","President Reagan denied he had beentold that profits from sales of arms to Iran had been used to aid the U.S.-backed  contra  rebels in Nicaragua.  No  that is not true   he said before a televised news conference when asked about reports that he had been told about the money diversion by his former National Security Adviser  John Poindexter. Reagan was giving his first formal White House press conference in four months since the Iran arms affair burst into scandal with the disclosure profits from weapons sales had been diverted  possibly illegally  to the contras. He said the secret approach to Iran had resulted in the release of three American hostages held by pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon and that it might have freed more if the operation had not been made public. Reagan told reporters -- as he had told a presidential commission that investigated the scandal -- that he did not remember when he had approved an August  1985  shipment of U.S. arms to Iran through Israel. Reagan opened the news conference -- seen as vital in rebuilding his damaged presidency and restoring his authority -- with a statement on the yawning U.S. budget deficit. He again stated his opposition to tax increases and called for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Asked if in hindsight he would again start a secret program to sell arms to Iran  Reagan said   No  I would not go down that same road again.  Tonight's news conference was widely seen as an opportunity for Reagan  76  to demonstrate he was in command of affairs despite the crisis. Reagan said  referring to the Iran arms program   If I hadn't thought it was right in the beginning  I never would have started it.  He said he went into the deal because he was persuaded that he was not dealing directly with the kidnappers.  You cannot do business with them   he said. But  suddenly you have a third party there (Iran) ... and it was not trading with the kidnappers   he said. The news conference in the White House East Room lasted 32 minutes -- two minutes more than normal -- most of which was devoted to the Iran affair. At the last minute  a reporter asked whether Vice President George Bush had opposed the arms sales as Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had done. Reagan replied   No   smiled  waved and walked away from the podium toward the White House residence."
"2","President Reagan said the U.S.government is still looking into the problem of acid rain.  We're still investigating this   he told a nationally televised news conference. Reagan added that the government will now work with U.S. industry to help address the problem. However  he declined to endorse the writing of federal standards for emissions that would help alleviate the problem. The Reagan administration yesterday announced a 2.5 billion dlr  five-year program to deal with acid rain  a problem that troubles U.S. relations with Canada. Reagan was asked by a reporter whether the government should set emission standards. He responded that the deeper that officials went in examining the acid rain problem  the more complex it appeared. He said the government did not want to rush into adopting a measure that might ultimately prove fruitless."
"2","President Reagan said the UnitedStates must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil. President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying.  We have to study this more   Reagan said.  This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve  but we have to do more   he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However  he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider  but made no specific recommendations."
"2","West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker called on creditor banks to ease pressure on Argentina's foreign debt repayment terms.  We cannot remain indifferent to the pressure of creditor banks  since there is correlation between political stability and the economic situation   Weizsaecker told reporters. Argentina said last month it would suspend debt payments if creditor banks did not loosen repayment terms and grant a new 2.15 billion dlr loan. Argentina's debt is Latin America's third largest at 51 billion dlrs. Weizsaecker  on a four-day official visit to Argentina  said:  Argentina's problems require joint action from creditor and debtors countries   and not prepared recipes from creditor banks. A group of ecologists staged a demonstration to protest Argentina's plans to build a fourth nuclear power plant and a German company's role in the project as a contractor. Earlier  Weizsaecker said that the potential of Patagonia  the barren tableland covering a third of Argentina  could assure the economic future of the country."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidJapan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament. The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget for the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over a proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business. Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington. Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June. Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in early April  Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on the matter  taking into account parliament debate. The package is likely to include a record amount of public works spending in the first 1987/88 half  Miyazawa said. Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8 800 billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1 800 billion for public works. Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help spur the economy  Miyazawa said. Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to the controversial sales tax without any revision. Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks by a top government official as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that  Miyazawa said."
"2","Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik.  The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s  when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement   he said in an address to Florida educators. He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance. The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation's trade gap  calculated on a balance-of-payments basis  swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter  bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs. Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading  writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate. Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics."
"2","The state-owned Krung Thai Bank Ltdwill start taking over state-owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete the process in a year  Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told a press conference. He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition between the two state-owned institutions. The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts  while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's name. Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd. Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At the end of 1985 the bank  with 13.8 billion baht of assets  was ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks. Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private management and was taking legal action to collect another four to five billion baht of doubtful debts. Krung Thai is Thailand's third largest bank."
"2","Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker said the suspension by Brazil of its foreign debt payments would not undermine U.S. Banks.

I don't think it's going to undermine public confidence in the banking system from Brazil alone   he said.  But I would like to see further progress made on this whole situation.  Brazil announced last month it was temporarily suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt owed to private banks  opening a new round in the five-year-old debt crisis. Last week  Ecuador suspended interest payments to private foreign banks  which hold about two-thirds of its total 8.3 billion dlr foreign debt  citing severe damage to its oil industry caused by an earthquake. Citicorp &lt;CCI> the largest U.S. Bank  said last week that it might have to reclassify most of its 4.6 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans as non-performing  thus removing them as part of the bank's expected income-producing assets. Analysts said such a move would sharply reduce Citicorp's profits and might result in similar measures by Brazil's other bank creditors. Volcker said he believed Brazil and Ecuador want to maintain continuity in their debt service.  It's fundamentally in their best interest. If they can get the financing and refinancing that's necessary  they may be able to make their economies grow again.  Asked whether he expected other nations to follow the path taken by Brazil and Ecuador  he said the two countries were special cases. He did not elaborate."
"2","Brazil's hard-line debt stance  thoughmeeting creditor resistance  is boosting political initiatives in Latin America aimed at broadening the global strategy  regional debt officials and economic analysts say.  Now more than ever it is clear that Latin America cannot pay  under present conditions  without sacrificing growth   Peruvian President Alan Garcia said  referring to Brazil. And  as debtors and creditors prepare for their annual meeting at the Inter-American Development Bank in Miami next week  the region's debt crisis is clearly coming to a head. Around 200 billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have been rescheduled since 1983  with interest rate margins now below one pct  multi-year accords a norm and no financial crash in sight  but a lasting solution seems no nearer. Virtually all Latin American leaders backed Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of private bank debt last month  though prospects of a chain default are still remote. Mexico  Colombia  Argentina and others rejected such action and Mexican finance minister Gustavo Petricioli merely said   Brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary.  But Brazil's action has had an impact on other debt negotiations  speeding agreement for Chile and Venezuela last month and influencing current talks with Argentina. Pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts  with the Philippines joining Brazil in seeking interest relief and Ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments following a serious earthquake. Private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lending and accept innovative repayment schemes  not only by debtors but also by official agencies which have stepped up their own credit flows as part of the U.S.-inspired plan. One Latin American debt official said he saw the Brazil and Ecuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors to link debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such as export earnings  GDP or raw materials prices. Despite this  debtor countries continue to accept the case-by-case approach  and Cuba's call for a joint negotiating front is not being promoted by Brazil or even defended by Peru  the region's flag-bearer in unilateral payment decisions.  Each nation must negotiate its debt independently  according to its own needs   Brazilian foreign minister Ramiro de Abreu Sodre said in Caracas at the weekend. Venezuela's rapid agreement with its creditors  soon after Brazil's move  had been seen by the political opposition as a betrayal of debtor solidarity  but de Abreu praised the Venezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal. Argentina  Bolivia  Costa Rica and others are also pursuing normal negotiations with creditor banks  while at the same time pressing hard for better terms  particularly lower interest rate spreads. Latin American officials say that while the debt should be negotiated case-by-case  their governments are promoting a general framework for talks based on growth and development priorities  lower interest payments and new financing.  The Brazilian and Ecuadorean experience shows orthodox solutions to debt cases don't work   said a senior Peruvian government official responsible for debt affairs. He saw a growing likelihood that other countries would follow Peru's action in setting a 10 pct debt payment limit in the face of trade and other factors beyond debtors' control such as minimal bank lending. These factors have contributed to a 130 billion dlr net outflow from Latin America in the last five years  and Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro says Brazil alone paid back 45 billion dlrs in this time and received just 11 billion in loans. Latin American debtors feel they have complied with their side of the bargain  slashing public spending  devaluing currencies  cutting inflation  privatizing state enterprises and introducing debt equity schemes. Brazil  as the region's biggest debtor and its most diversified economy  has now apparently adopted the principle that a tough position with its creditors will avoid a more serious crisis later on.  We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis   Funaro told a conference in Rio de Janeiro this week. billion dlr debt burden this year are slim  with coffee prices plunging  oil prices up but still well below 1985 levels and interest rates beginning to rise. Mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two to three pct projected earlier  and inflation near 80 pct after 105 pct last year. Brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct after eight pct last year and a 30 pct drop in the projected trade surplus  while independent estimates put inflation at 200 pct. Political and economic analysts in Brazil believe the payment suspension will give new impetus to tackling the regional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations  a view echoed by senior international bank officials. Some banks  including Citibank  Morgan Guaranty and Bank of America are already preparing to downgrade their Brazil loans. Brazil's refusal to accept an IMF program  a condition set by many banks for new lending  meanwhile reflects the view of most Latin American governments that equate the Fund with recession. But Brazil and Venezuela are the only countries in the region to have rescheduled debt without an IMF program."
"2","President Reagan  staying cool undera televised grilling on the Iran-contra scandal  insisted he has told all he knows about the crippling affair and said he would do it all differently given a second chance.  No  I would not go down that same road again   the president said last night during a 32-minute news conference  his first in exactly four months  when asked if he would again sell arms to Iran in hopes of freeing U.S. hostages in the Middle East. But he added   I'll keep my eye open for an opportunity again for improving relations. And we will continue to explore every legitimate means for getting our hostages back.  As expected  the televised conference was almost completely dominated by questions about the secret sales of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to  contra  rebels in Nicaragua. From an investigators' standpoint  the toughest question concerned 76-year-old Reagan's knowledge of the contra operation. As expected  the president repeatedly stated -- now calmly  now with some fire -- that he knew nothing about that scheme  said to have been run by White House National Security aide Oliver North  since fired  with the knowledge of presidential adviser John Poindexter  now resigned.  No  that is not true at all   the president replied sternly when asked about a report Poindexter had told him  twice  about the secret channeling of millions of dollars to the contras.  When I went on the air right after the news broke (about Iran arms deal last November)  I did not know at that time there was any money involved.  He said he learned of the contra diversion -- which may have broken U.S. laws and will be the top priority of congressional investigative hearings on this affair -- only when Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese told him on November 25. Just as important from Reagan's standpoint  however  was the manner in which he handled his first non-scripted public accounting of the scandal since the details first began leaking out last November and plunged his administration into deep political crisis. He appeared to bring it off without major stumbles  abetted by a press corps that seemed at pains to maintain a civil manner until the very end when it crowded round him trying to get in one last question as he was leaving the rostrum in the White House East Room. He often responded slowly and deliberately but never seemed at a loss for words  or vintage Reagan mannerisms. At one point in the contra discussion he furrowed his brow in puzzlement as he said he was just as mystified as everyone about where all the unaccounted millions had gone from the Iran arms sales of 1985 and 1986.  I'm still wanting to find out the source of all the extra money  the bank accounts and where that extra money went   he said. At another point  he laughed off a question on whether he might have been told about the contra connection and forgotten  saying   Oh  no   pausing to chuckle and adding:  You'd have heard me without opening the door to my office if I'd been told that."
"2","President Ronald Reagan said hewould veto any tax increases voted by Congress.  My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid   Reagan said during a televised news conference. The president said he opposed efforts by some members of Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  It's time Congress cut the federal budget and left the family budget alone   Reagan said. He said the congressional budget process was in desperate need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S. constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.  This yearly deficit feeding process must stop   he added.  We must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  In the meantime  he said  Congress cannot back away from the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said."
"2","President Reagan said the UnitedStates must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil. President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying.  We have to study this more   Reagan said.  This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve  but we have to do more   he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However  he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider  but made no specific recommendations."
"2","President Reagan said the U.S.government is still looking into the problem of acid rain.  We're still investigating this   he told a nationally televised news conference. Reagan added that the government will now work with U.S. industry to help address the problem. However  he declined to endorse the writing of federal standards for emissions that would help alleviate the problem. The Reagan administration yesterday announced a 2.5 billion dlr  five-year program to deal with acid rain  a problem that troubles U.S. relations with Canada. Reagan was asked by a reporter whether the government should set emission standards. He responded that the deeper that officials went in examining the acid rain problem  the more complex it appeared. He said the government did not want to rush into adopting a measure that might ultimately prove fruitless."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidJapan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament. The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget for the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over a proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business. Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington. Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June. Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in early April  Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on the matter  taking into account parliament debate. The package is likely to include a record amount of public works spending in the first 1987/88 half  Miyazawa said. Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8 800 billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1 800 billion for public works. Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help spur the economy  Miyazawa said. Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to the controversial sales tax without any revision. Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks by a top government official as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that  Miyazawa said."
"2","Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik.  The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s  when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement   he said in an address to Florida educators. He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance. The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation's trade gap  calculated on a balance-of-payments basis  swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter  bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs. Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading  writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate. Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat over the long-term the tax reform bill and lower marginal tax rates should increase compliance with the tax law and bring in additional revenue. In testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee Baker said no savings in the Treasury's budgetary requirements wil be achieved in the short-run by the new tax law.  The tax changes occurring in 1987 and 1988 under tax reform will not directly effect IRS enforcement activities until financial year 1989 and 1990.  He told the subcommittee that the Treasury's objective was to strengthen the capability of the Internal Revenue Service to promote tax compliance and generate revenue. He said they were seeking funds to increase staffing to reduce the backlog of delinquent tax accounts  reducing pending tax litigation cases under appeal  and resolving unreported income cases disclosed through a program that matches third party documents to returns.  This request will continue our effort to build a stronger and more credible deterrent against non-compliance with tax laws   he said. Baker also told the subcommittee that the administration would continue the efforts to improve the management of the government's cash and credit  and its financial information. In addition a policy of full reimbursement to Federal Reserve Banks for the fiscal agent services they provide in marketing and maintaining Treasury securities will be continued."
"2","Australian Treasurer Paul Keating saidhe expects the country's 1986/87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the August budget. Keating told a financiers' dinner that February's 750 mln dlr deficit  against January's 1.23 billion  was  in the groove  of the government's expectations.  We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion  I think  which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget   Keating said.  I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP.  Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend. Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election  because it would take time to stabilise Australia's 80 billion dlr foreign debt.  We have to build the import competing sector back   he said.  We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing.  Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation. The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14  he said."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidin a newspaper interview that he supports the current course of Federal Reserve Board monetary policy.  The course of Fed policy is quite adequate as far as we are concerned   Baker said in an interview with the New York Times. In the interview  Baker declined to comment about the recent Paris accord among the six leading industrialized democracies when he was asked why the U.S. agreed to stabilize the dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit a record level last year. Baker said in the newspaper interview that it was  a subject I prefer not to talk about.  He said that if he explained why the U.S. agreed to help maintain the dollar at current levels  I would of necessity end up getting into some of the private agreements that support such and agreement  on the dollar. Baker was optimistic about Brazil  which has stopped interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign commercial banks.  They are  after all  paying on time all the debt service and principal on their official debts  having just rescheduled with the Paris Club   Baker said in the newspaper interview. Baker said that Brazilian repreentatives had explained they intented to pay their commercial bank debts in full but needed time."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe administration still opposes Senate Banking Committee legislation that would close a key loophole in federal bankinng law. The loophole has spawned a proliferation of limited service banks known as non-bank banks that can engage in risky activities barred to traditional banks. Baker has been asked to support the legislation by Banking Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc). Proxmire's panel approved closing the loophole in a bill recapitalizing the thrift insurance fund. Baker said the administration supports moving a bill through Congress that would address only the recapitalization issue  for fear such  collateral provisions  as the loophole-closing measure would stall the bill. Proxmire later told reporters he backs the committee bill with or without administration support.  I'm going to push it through in any event   he said. The administration also opposes the committee bill on grounds it bars new banking powers. The administration is a long time backer of banking deregulation."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker tolda Senate Appropriations subcommittee there is still lots of room for improvement in government programs to crack down on tax cheating.  I think we're far from the point at which we reach saturation   Baker said when asked at what point additional efforts to catch cheating become fruitless. He said Internal Revenue Service efforts would raise a projected 41 billion dlrs in fiscal 1988 compared to 18 billion dlrs in 1981.  So we are increasing   Baker said."
"2","The Bank of Finland said it hasstarted dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market. Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30  1987  by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.  The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments   Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs  they said.  The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country   one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.  We are free to do it  so maybe on Monday we will issue the first  just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week   Korkman told Reuters. He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity. The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market. Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week  while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion. On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks' CDs  estimated to be some eight billion markka. In addition  commercial paper accounts for around five billion markka and Treasury Bills two billion."

I am adamantly opposed to the excessive spending that is in the bill as it emerged from a (House-Senate) conference committee   he said in a statement. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan had reservations on 152 so-called demonstration highway projects and on the amount for transit projects. The bill called for transit projects totalling 17.8 billion dlrs  compared to 8.7 billion proposed by the administration. Fitzwater said  however  that Reagan supported the right of states to raise the highway speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph  a provision that is also in the legislation."
"2","British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchercame under fresh pressure for an early election today as financial indicators bolstered the government's forecasts of a boom in the economy following the budget earlier this week. Two of the country's leading lending institutions announced cuts in home loans rates following Wednesday's cut in interest rates by the main banks by half a point to 10 per cent. Analysts said today's reduction by Abbey National from 12.75 pct to 11.25  and one by the Halifax Building Society from 12.25 to 11.25 in lending rates for house buyers would be followed by other main institutions. One financial analyst commented:  I imagine the Abbey National is being toasted in Downing Street (the prime minister's residence) but not in the boardrooms of other big societies.  Coupled with income tax cuts announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Nigel Lawson in his budget last Tuesday as well as recent opinion polls showing Thatcher's rightwing Conservative Party well ahead of Labour and the centrist Alliance  they said pressure was now building up on Thatcher to call a general election as early as June. Yesterday there was more good news for Thatcher in the form of a continuing drop in the number of unemployed  with government minister predicting that it would fall below the three million mark before long."
"2","British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson pledged to continue making defeat of inflation a top priority. Speaking to the ruling Central Council of the Conservative Party  Lawson said  We will continue to make defeat of inflation a top priority until it is eliminated altogether.  Year on year inflation is running at 3.7 pct. Lawson said that under the government's program of selling off state industries to the private sector the number of share- holders in the country had trebled since 1979 and now represented one in five of the adult population."
"2","High interest rates  sluggish globaleconomic growth and creeping protectionism are deepening the third world debt crisis  senior Mexican officials said. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said today's signing of a 76 billion dlr new-loan and rescheduling package for Mexico was the most comprehensive and far-reaching effort in debt management yet achieved for a sovereign borrower. But  in remarks prepared for the signing ceremony  he warned against complacency.  The debt problem is not solved. If anything  it has been exacerbated by recent events.   The inequities of the international economic environment conspire against the welfare and stability of developing countries   Petricioli added. The debt problem will not be solved unless developing countries are allowed to grow  he argued.  There will be no solution without the further development of trade throughout the world. . Director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters that Mexico's economy should resume growth this year  but he said external conditions are not favorable. Latin America is grappling with adverse terms of trade  for instance  as underlined by the recent slide in coffee prices. Interest rates remain unacceptably high in real terms  Gurria added.  Inflation has literally disappeared from the face of the earth in the industrialized world  but interest rates are still near seven pct.  Industrial powers must also improve the coordination of their economic policies to boost unacceptably low growth rates and to keep export markets open  said Gurria  who is Mexico's chief debt negotiator. The officials also had a blunt warning for those banks that refuse to participate in the loan package: Do not expect to get much business with Mexico in the future. About 60 of Mexico's 430 or so creditor banks worldwide have still to join the loan  but four more acceptances were received today  according to senior Citibank executive William Rhodes  who is co-chairman of Mexico's advisory committee.  Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will continue to be open and willing to share with them the business opportunities which its future growth will create.  Those few who have denied their responsibility have turned their backs on this remarkable effort of international cooperation  on the financial system and on their enlightened colleagues   Petricioli said. One way that Mexico could punish recalcitrant banks would be to deny  or at least slow down  applications to convert Mexican debt into equity investments within the country.  We will be a lot more expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have supported us   Gurria said  adding   We have long memories.  Debt-equity conversions are an attractive way for banks to provide clients with subsidized pesos for investment in Mexico and to collect handsome brokerage fees or reduce their own Mexican exposure in the process. The growing popularity of the scheme was underlined this week when American Express Bank  which has joined the new Mexican package  said it plans to convert 100 mln dlrs of its own loans into an equity stake in hotel projects in Mexico. Mexico halted the debt-equity program on Feb. 25 to force banks to concentrate on wrapping up the financing pakcage  and Gurria said it would resume once the first part of the six billion dlr loan that forms the core of the deal is disbursed. The loan is now 99 pct subscribed. Gurria said Mexico hopes to close the books by the middle of April in time for a drawdown by the end of April. Although the agreements were signed in the sumptuous surroundings of a midtown Manhattan hotel  the atmosphere of the signing ceremony was rather subdued  with bankers and officials showing little of the elation and relief that normally follows the conclusion of a mammoth deal. After five months of arduous work syndicating the loan  debt fatigue was apparent and the talk was of ways to make the financing process less cumbersome.  This (package) has been harder than all the others... I hope we find a way that's not so debilitating for the people who have to put them together   Gurria said."
"2","Japan has agreed to drop barriers toAmerican-caught herring and pollock  opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced. Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo. He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years. There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments  but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms. At the same time  Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish. He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement."
"2","Additional capital inflows of 1.5billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs  director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter  Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months  Gurria noted. Nevertheless  Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs  and Gurria said today   We expect we'll never have to use it.  Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel  oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September  which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt  and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement  he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico  despite the debt restructuring."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conablesaid he believed Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt interest payments is temporary. Conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown on public broadcasting tomorrow said Brazil now has the attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan designed to reform its economy.  I think the Brazilians have the attention of many of their creditors  but they must come up with a plan that will persuade people that the Brazilian economy is going to be put on a course that will result in some growth.  Turning to Japan  Conable said the role of that country has been increasing in the World Bank and is expected to continue to do so. He said that Japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr pledge to the International Development Association  an indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in line with its economic position. Conable said there was no indication that the Soviet Union was serious about joining the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He said they would have to get convertible currency and open their books and the Soviets  don't usually do that."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conable isexpected to press Indonesia  the Third World's sixth largest debtor  to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues  western diplomats said. Conable  who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo  will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well  but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java  Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia  the only Asian member of OPEC  has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices  which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia  a country of 168 mln people  has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending  devaluing its currency by 31 pct  and trying to boost exports  while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change  particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy.  Oil prices  the debt crisis  the world recession  all call for major policy adjustments and external support   Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month  he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.  We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed   Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs  according to the Bank  which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia  but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support  the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures  and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports  liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month  the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies  which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1  from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87."
"2","President Jose Sarney  whose handlingof the economy is under attack at home and abroad  has held private talks with Brazilian business leaders worried that government policies are leading to recession. Over an informal barbecue at a farm outside Sao Paulo owned by millionaire entrepreneur Matias Machline  Sarney met more than 20 businessmen for discussion on Brazil's economic crisis. Business leaders said before the meeting they would be pressing for less government interference in what they describe as a tightly regulated economy. Their concerns include the country's high rates of interest and tough restrictions on imports. Machline  president of the Sharp electronics group and a personal friend of Sarney's  told television reporters outside his farm that he wanted  less government participation in the economy.  When the government announced a month ago that it was suspending interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks  it said this was a means of ensuring growth and avoiding recession. But business leaders and economic analysts say there are growing signs that Brazil's economy  the eighth biggest in the non-communist world  is heading for a downturn after 8 pct growth last year. Businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect on industry of import restrictions introduced earlier this year because of the country's deteriorating trade balance. Cacex  the foreign trade department of the federally owned Banco do Brasil  has told companies they must limit their imports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985. Business sources say that in practice importing even this amount is difficult and they have to haggle with Cacex on a case-by-case basis. The business daily Gazeta Mercantil reported that in many sectors of the economy there was a real fear that production lines would grind to a halt next month. One of those attending the talks was Mario Amato  head of the powerful Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation (FIESP). Business sources said he would argue that unless there were a relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrial activity was inevitable. Relations between Sarney and the business community have at times been strained and the existence of these tensions pointed up the importance of the meeting. In one bizarre dispute in January  Sarney surprised Brazilian business leaders by declaring that they were allies of the 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. This outburst came after Amato warned that companies might start disobeying government regulations on price controls. Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that Finance Minister Dilson Funaro  chief architect of the government's economic policy  had not been invited to the gathering."
"2","Bank of Italy governor Carlo Ciampiappointed three commissioners to take over the temporary running of the Cassa di Risparmio di Calabria e Lucania (Carical). The announcement  in a Bank of Italy statement  followed the decision on Friday by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria to send in special commissioners after accepting the resignation of Carical president Francesco Sapio and hearing a report detailing  serious irregularities  at the bank. Goria's decision was taken in line with a provision in Italy's banking legislation which allows the Treasury to dissolve administrative bodies in the case of  serious management irregularities or serious violations of legal and statutory norms  that regulate credit institutions. Senior officials declined to give details of the irregularities that had come to light at Carical  whose activities are concentrated in Calabria in the toe of Italy. The Bank of Italy statement said the three special commissioners would work under the control of the Bank of Italy with the aim of safeguarding the interests of depositors  and ensuring the normal running of Carical until a solution to its  present problems  could be found. The statement said it was hoped a solution could be found as soon as possible."
"2","King Fahd of Saudi Arabia begins afour-day state visit on Tuesday which will focus on redressing Britain's large trade surplus with the kingdom and reaffirming ties between the traditionally close countries. British officials said King Fahd may ask Britain to restore diplomatic relations with Syria  broken off by London last October after evidence in the trial of Nizar Hindawi showed Syrian agents were behind a plan to bomb an Israeli airliner. But one official said the king would be told Britain still needs  clear and sustainable evidence that the Syrians have renounced state-sponsored terrorism. So far they haven't.  Britain will stress its support for an international peace conference on the Middle East and its concern over alleged human rights abuses by Israel in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  the officials told Reuters. The Saudi leader will hold talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip during the visit  his first to Britain since he assumed power in June 1982. King Fahd will be accompanied by his trade  defence  oil and health ministers  who will hold talks with their British counterparts. Relations between the two countries have generally been warm. But they were strained last year by the deportation of 35 British nurses from the kingdom for illegal drinking and the publication of a letter by a retired British ambassador describing Saudi Arabians as incompetent and arrogant. Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest export market in the Middle East. Britain exported 1.5 billion stg worth of goods to Saudi Arabia last year while British imports from that country in the same period totalled 436 mln. Trade officials will discuss what countertrade Britain can offer in return for Riyadh giving London its biggest-ever arms export order. Under the five billion stg deal signed last year  Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy 132 warplanes including 72 Tornado fighters. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer is likely to discuss oil price stabilisation but Britain would not change its refusal to limit its North Sea oil production and exports  officials said. Saudi Arabia  the world's biggest oil exporter  has asked all oil-producing countries to help stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel by curbing output and exports. King Fahd's trip follows several visits to Saudi Arabia by British officials in recent months. Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana went to Saudi Arabia in November. There were two previous state tours of Britain by Saudi monarchs. King Faisal visited in 1967 and King Khaled in 1981."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakeragain said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday:  We don't have a target for the dollar.  He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar  saying:  We really don't talk about the dollar.  He said protectionism was becoming  extremely strong  in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries.  The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong   he said.  As I've said before  we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system  because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s   he said. While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism  it alone did not offer any solution  he said.  You must address this problem on the exchange rate side  but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that  and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach   Baker said in the interview. Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards  as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries."
"2","The United States and Japanare on the brink of serious conflict on trade  especially over semiconductors  Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers  and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC  the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years.  Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is  maybe  five or six years in the future.  He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago.  That's a very healthy development   he added. If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.   Members of Congress  that is the contemplative members of Congress  have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit   Yeutter said.  They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and  in my judgement  more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.  He added   Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter."
"2","Yugoslavia  whose economic crisis isunder close scrutiny by foreign creditors  will not follow Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt  Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying. Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency. He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would continue to do so  but he said creditors and international institutions should show more  understanding  for Yugoslavia's situation. Mikulic said Yugoslavia had  understanding  for what Brazil had done. Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation  lagging exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army could be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a record 5.97 billion in capital and interest  reducing its overall debt by 996 mln dlrs. Government ministers told reporters last week they regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the cost to the economy had been too great. Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas   radical changes  in interest rates and repayment times were needed. Western economists said Mikulic's remarks  taken with those of his ministers  could be a signal some problems were seen ahead in financing the debt repayments. Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered by the Paris club at the end of this month. The International Monetary Fund  which recently reviewed the Yugoslav economy  is said by Western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year. Mikulic visits West Germany next week  and debt is expected to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl."
"2","Brazilian business leaders attendinga weekend meeting with President Jose Sarney called on the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in resolving its debt problems. The government has so far rejected suggestions that it let the IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt  the biggest in the Third World. Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program for Brazil  adopted four years ago  caused a recession and he believes another IMF program would stifle growth. Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr commercial debt  a move which has found little favour among the country's business community. Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF  arguing this would give the country access to new funds and allow the economy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the course they favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.  We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does  if necessary going to the IMF   Mario Amato  president of the Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation  was quoted as saying. An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very difficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm indications such a policy reversal is in the offing. The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance is Finance Minister Dilson Funaro  who was not present at yesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his absence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present seized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see Funaro leave his job."
"2","Economics Minister Martin Bangemann saidthe state could not continue to pour money into West Germany's ailing steel and coal industries because the subsidies endangered other parts of the economy.  The situation is completely absurd from an economic point of view   Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interview released ahead of publication tomorrow.  We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steel to an enormous extent and at the same time putting a huge burden on all other branches of industry and making them uncompetitive   he said. Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longer capable of being competitive. Continued state subsidies would not save them but would only prolong their lives artifically for a few years  he said.  That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them in the way that we have done in the past   he said. Several steel firms have announced plans to reduce their workforces  citing weak prices and lower exports due to the strength of the mark and tough foreign competition. Bangemann said everything possible would be done to find new jobs for the workers affected by the cuts."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidany attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin American debtor nations might damage the world economy. In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald  Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief  calling it a  dramatic  overnight solution.   While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some political appeal  they are impractical and counterproductive in the long run   he said. The article was published to coincide with a three-day meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third World debt. Brazil  the Third World's largest debtor  last month declared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no indication of when it may resume interest payments  prompting fears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the U.S. Strategy. Baker  defending the strategy  said private commercial banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since October 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.  Together with expected progress in commercial bank discussions with Argentina and  we hope  Brazil  this should add up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors in 1987   Baker wrote. He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major debtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell Third World debt at a discount to investors who then become stockholders in firms in these countries.  These swaps aren't a panacea  but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can make progress in reducing the debt burden   he said."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conableshould prod the government of President Suharto towards further economic change  the Jakarta Post newspaper said.  Conable could do Indonesia a great service if he is straightforward enough to point his finger at shortcomings that could be corrected   it said in an editorial. The English-language paper said the bureacracy was not aggressive or imaginative in responding to Indonesia's economic problems  which include fiscal restraints due to drastically declining oil revenues  increasing unemployment  and marketing problems for its major export commodities. The paper said Indonesia must boost the scope for private business initiative as well as stepping up its use of aid money already committed. The World Bank has lent Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Conable arrived here on Saturday and will have talks with Suharto tomorrow. Today he was returning to Jakarta from a visit to World Bank-funded projects in eastern Java  and was scheduled to meet leading economic ministers in the afternoon. Western diplomats said they expected Conable to press Indonesia to maintain the pace of its present economic reforms to cope with the slump in its oil revenues."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defendedhis tax reform plans from fierce opposition  even within his own party  as campaigning for local elections began.  Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong. Unless we reform the system now  Japan is bound to decay  perhaps within the next 10 years   Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July. Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax  one of the main planks in the tax reform package  and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies. In Tokyo  incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands. A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax  which Nakasone proposes to implement next January  into consideration when they vote. Takako Doi  Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party  said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax  The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it).  The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures. A close aide to Nakasone  who asked not to be identified  said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates  irrespective of party affiliation  are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls."
"2","Philippines Trade andIndustry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils. Concepcion  speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here  said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted. He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries. Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers  he noted that  I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.  He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices  but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.  The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed   he said."

The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln  up from 391 mln in 1986. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where  pigs are not fed  there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed.   We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000   he said.  We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain.  The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains  including corn and rice  unchanged since 1978  but it gave no details."

Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth  the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports  Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos. Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two pct last year  compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct and 1.1 pct growth in 1985. He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.

"2","Ministers from more than 20nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured. Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.  We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system   he said.  We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all   Moore said.  The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000   he added. The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the  Uruguay round  talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful  with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected. Moore said one aim was to  instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.  Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits  as well as preventing  bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.  The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks  patents and copyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker  facingthe toughest challenge to his Third World debt plan so far  is expected today to stoutly defend the strategy. At an opening address to the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank here Baker is likely once again to bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debt relief. The speech comes after Washington delayed its bid to wrest control of IADB lending from Latin nations. The Treasury Secretary is also expected  U.S. officials say  to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his plan to promote inflation-free economic growth  open markets  and a much-reduced government role in the economies of Latin America.  We have already seen substantial progress   Baker said in a Miami Herald article and argued the plan was never meant to be a  quick fix . But Brazil  Ecuador  Peru  Nicaragua and Bolivia have all ceased servicing some or all of their debt. Brazil's interest payments moratorium  announced last month  is being seen as a major challenge to the Baker plan. Owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs  Brazil called an indefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt. Brazilian Central Banker Francisco Gros met bankers last night to begin what U.S. officials predict will be months of extremely tough negotiations. The scale of the problem is immense. Owing some 382 billion dlrs of foreign debt  Latin nations have since the start of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interest and principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans. In addition  upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flight is estimated to have left the region during that time. The Baker plan  unveiled in October  1985  calls on commercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about 29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 major debtors engaging in fundamental economic reform. The theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed its economy  it can service its debt comfortably and without an atmosphere of crisis. U.S. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has been paid out in the first 14 months of the plan  payments of over 70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future and Washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keep debtor-creditor negotiations afloat. Baker is expected to underscore these points in his address today."

Boesky and Co LP through the preparation of deceptive partnership documents. The suit also names as defendants &lt;Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc>  investment banker for the partnership  law firm Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver and Jacobson and its attorney Stephen Fraidin  and financial services company Seligmann Harris and Co  as well as former Drexel investment bankers Dennis A. Levine and Martin A. Siegel. Levine and Siegel have already pleaded guilty to insider trading violations  as has Boesky. The suit alleges that partnership documents prepared by the law firm were misleading because they failed to disclose the criminal violations to which Boesky later pleaded guilty. Seligman helped recruit investors to the partnership  according to the suit. The suit said the papers failed to disclose Drexel's financial interests in the partnership.  It also said Boesky failed to meet a pledge to invest at least 20 mln dlrs in the partnership. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of damages from the partnership and Boesky and damages from Fried  Frank and Fraidin. The plaintiffs include Home Group Inc &lt;HME>  Lincoln National Corp &lt;LNC>  a number of other institutional investors and recently-named Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS> asset management unit senior advisor Lewis Lehrman."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defendedhis tax reform plans from fierce opposition  even within his own party  as campaigning for local elections began.  Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong. Unless we reform the system now  Japan is bound to decay  perhaps within the next 10 years   Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July. Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax  one of the main planks in the tax reform package  and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies. In Tokyo  incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands. A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax  which Nakasone proposes to implement next January  into consideration when they vote. Takako Doi  Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party  said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax  The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it).  The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures. A close aide to Nakasone  who asked not to be identified  said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates  irrespective of party affiliation  are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls."
"2","Treasury Secertary James Baker saidcurrencies were now within ranges that better reflected economic fundamentals. In a speech to the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank  he said   Excchange have moved into ranges that better reflect economic fundamentals.  He noted that in particular that dollar has fallen from its high point in early 1985 helping to moderate protectionist pressures in the U.S."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidhe was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-American Development Bank with other member nations. In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of the IADB  Baker said   We are making progress in negotiating reforms.  And he added that if succesful  Washington would be ready to put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADB four-year capital replenishment  an increase of 75 pct. It was not immediately clear what the overall size of the capital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with such a capital increase. But Baker's statement that he had made progress in negotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank's policy making board of governors at which the reform issue was put off until next June because of deep differences between Washington and Latin borrowing countries. Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct of the bank's useable financial resources. Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in IADB board meetings considering loans to Latin American countries. But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote and frequently approve loans to which economic reform conditions are not tied. Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pct of the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of the vote. Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisions for itself and other creditor countries.  In view of this imbalance we don't believe it is unreasonable to ask for a change   Baker said. He said the changes sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a greater majority of shares than a simple majority. But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S. position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote. Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see  Baker said he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S. debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth  open markets and a reduced government role in the economies of debtor nations. Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a major program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor countries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms in those areas of their economies. Such reforms would include  among other things  more concern for natural resource management. Baker said this lending should help debtors make a transition to more open economies and freer markets. He also said the bank could double its current lending volume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the poorest nations. The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve its analysis of the policies of debtor countries  strengthening its process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations. He urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker said   We simply believe that more discretion and policy influence should lie with the parties which contribute the lion's share of resources.  He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the Reagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB and other multilateral development banks. Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the best of circumstances  he said it would be impossible if Congress did not have confidence in bank lending policies."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker urgedcommercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the third world debt burden.  I believe the commercial banks need to be open to creative ideas for reducing the debt burden   Baker told the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank. But he said that he was confident banks would make  substantial new lending  to the major debtors this year. He pointed out principal debtor nations are expected to grow an average 3.5 pct this year  the fastest real rate of growth since 1980. Saying the U.S. debt strategy was making  substantial headway   Baker said import volumes of debtor countries are forecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almost five pct -- the best performance in three years. He also said economic growth has kept pace with or surpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtors since 1983.  This is a start -- and I venture to say a good one   the Treasury Secretary said  and he urged the audience of Western and Latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast against suggestions of solutions like debt relief. While such ideas have political appeal  Baker said  they would mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors. And even if free market reforms followed  debt fogiveness would frighten away investors who would not  risk their capital in a country which abandoned its obligations.  And he said   A debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial stability.  He cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a  gradual and painstaking  process  varying from country to country. Reporting on the U.S. debt strategy  Baker said attitudes in debtor nations have changed and there is much greater acceptance of free market reforms than hitherto. Some countries like Argentina are pursuing anti-inflation programs. Others  like the Philippines and Chile  are privatizing companies and swapping debt for equity. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank  meanwhile  have committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major debtor nations since late 1985  official creditors have rescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the Paris club  while commercial banks are making new loans. Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70 billion dlrs of debt  reaching agreements recently with Chile  Venezuela and Mexico. Elsewhere in his speech  Baker outlined the progress industrial nations are making in promoting moderate global growth  low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade imbalances. He maintained world economic conditions were  continuuing to improve  a development that would provide a positive backdrop for debtor nations."

"2","The West German Economics Minister todaydenied giving a newspaper interview which quoted him as saying the state could not continue to pour money into the country's ailing steel and coal industries. Economics Ministry spokesman Dieter Vogel said in a statement Bangemann had contacted him from New Zealand  where he is attending a General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) ministerial meeting  to deny giving the interview to the conservative daily Die Welt. The paper quoted Bangemann as saying that continued subsidies would endanger other parts of the German economy by making them uncompetitive. Vogel said Bangemann had pledged that everything possible would be done to minimize the effects of reduced coal and steel production on the workforces and regions concerned. Die Welt said the interview with Bangemann had taken place at a meeting of his Free Democratic Party (FDP) in Darmstadt last Friday  adding that it had a tape recording of his comments which it would publish tomorrow."
"2","The French government will take decisionsshortly to boost the funds available for technological research by state industry  Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said.

We will take decisions on this shortly -- and they will be positive   he said in a departure from a prepared text. He gave no details and Industry Ministry officials had no immediate comment. Warning that high technology exports were rapidly losing world market share  Chirac urged private sector industry to step up its research efforts. Private sector research and development spending  at 1.3 pct of Gross Domestic Product  was below the 1.8 to 1.9 pct of GDP spent in the U.S.  West Germany and Japan  he said. France awarded only 12 000 registered patents in 1986  compared with 20 000 in Britain  30 000 in West Germany  60 000 in the U.S. And more than 200 000 in Japan  he said.

"2","Bolivia's top union leader today joineda hunger strike by 1 300 state employed miners and workers to press for higher wages he said. Juan Lechin Oquendo  the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization  COB  told reporters:  I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike . Lechin  83  became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro. The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9 000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay. About 1 300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia's minimum monthly wage  which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs)  COB leader Walter Degadillo said.  I will take part in the miners' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast   Lechin told reporters. The COMIBOL miners' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry. About 20 000 miners  or two-thirds of the working force  have been laid off through the government's decision to streamline the deficit-ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price. The government  faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies  has called the miners' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker  who began a four-day visit last Friday.  I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike   Lechin told reporters.  I also have to orga- nise the strike.  Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez  the miners' federation top leader. Although lopez has not joined the fast  union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner."
"2","France's Economic and Social Council(CES)  an advisory body comprising industrialists  trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy  said the country's annual growth may not reach two pct in 1987. French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two pct growth registered last year  the Council said in a report on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any specific forecasts. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct. Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les Echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment. CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation. Disinflation was an absolute priority  Neeser told journalists  adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years."

West german aid to Bolivia last year totalled 50 mln marks and officials travelling with President Richard Von Weizsaecker said overall aid to Bolivia is expected to reach 91 mln marks this year. Weizsaecker is expected to announce the figure in a major speech later today at the bolivian congress  the officials said."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidleading Latin American nations have delayed accepting a U.S. compromise proposal on major reforms of the Inter-American Development Bank. In an interview with a small group of reporters  Baker said discussions on far-reaching reforms of the bank would resume around the fringes of the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in two weeks time. But Baker said his compromise proposal  which he would not disclose  was no longer on the table.  I made it clear that the proposal was not one that I expected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at this meeting   Baker said. The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loans which were made on terms Washington considers far too lax. In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy  Washington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe nine billion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of the Bank. In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct simple majority voting power over IADB lending. Baker said   In my view  they have not rejected it out of hand at all and that it will be considered  should we choose to advance it at the April meeting.  A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effective four-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs. The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billion dlrs  but usable resources would be less because the callable capital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take place in practice  U.S. officials explained. In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct simple majority voting power over IADB lending. Initially  the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed with a loan  a position that would have given the U.S. a virtual veto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes. But it seemed clear from Baker's remarks he was at one point ready to concede an increased voting power  such as 62.5 pct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans  that would amount to a compromise between the original U.S. and Latin American positions. Baker said   In my view  they have not rejected it out of hand at all and that it will be considered  should we choose to advance it at the April meeting.  Baker made clear that since Mexico  Brazil  Venezuela and Argentina  representing the Latins  had declined to accept the plan today  the U.S. had reverted to its original position  but he added   It's possible the proposal could be revived.  U.S. officials  who asked not to be named  said they believed a decision was not forthcoming because several top Latin finance officials were absent from the IADB annual meetings here. And one official added that the key Latin officials would be present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is left unresolved  we can't look towards a greater (capital) replenishment here.  That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateral development bank  like the World Bank  as its principal vehicle for lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtor nations. The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather than sectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence has never fully participated in Baker's third world debt plan."

"2","Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has agreedto meet African National Congress president Oliver Tambo in Ottawa sometime in late April or early May  a senior official for the outlawed South African organization said. Mac Maharaz said Mulroney and Tambo would discuss more possible Canadian sanctions against the South African government. Maharaz  visiting Ottawa to speak to a conference on native Indian rights  said Tambo would urge Mulroney to cut all diplomatic and economic ties with South Africa. He said that Tambo would also ask Mulroney to refuse diplomatic accreditation to South Africa's newly designated ambassador to Canada  Johannes de Klerk.  I certainly would regard Canada's refusal to accept the accreditation of any further ambassador as a significant movement   said Maharaz.  I think in diplomatic protocol  it would be a major signal."
"2","Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called onAmericans to pressure Congress in the fight against acid rain in what some observers said may represent a shift in Canada's lobbying strategy with the United States. Mulroney told delegates to a North American wildlife conference that he has not been pleased with the U.S. administration's lack of speed in acting on the question  which Canada sees  he said   as a test of our relationship  with the U.S. Mulroney and President Reagan endorsed a report by specially appointed acid rain envoys last year. Last week  the White  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fund the acid rain fight. Mulroney described the commitment as  significant   but noted it was a long time in coming.  We are geared up  tanked up and raring to go   Mulroney said.  But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace with which the U.S. administration moved to implement the president's acceptance of the envoy report.  The prime minister urged his mostly American audience to help Canada take the fight to Congress  saying his government is determined to fight on more than one front.  The campaign does not involve either or choices between the administration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other   he said. The Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain hailed Mulroney's call to take the battle to Congress.  It is clear that he has an understanding now that Congress must be emphasized as equally as the administration   said spokesman Michael Perley."
"2","Britain has reaped profits by using astronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate   I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.  Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise  he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week  he said that  during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September  I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.  He said that that one percentage point increase  effected in October 1986  had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986  government sources said."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said thetime has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris. In Paris  Britain  Canada  France  Japan  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels. Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take  but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris.

"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este  Uruguay  last September. Yeutter said  at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.  There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and  a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there   Yeutter said. However  the hard work is still to come  with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead  he said.  It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy   he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating  he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process  but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years  he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that  which is an ineffective use of financial resources  he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations  he said  one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package."
"2","West German aid to Bolivia will rise to91 mln marks in 1987 from 50 mln in 1986  West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker said. Weizsaecker  speaking to the Bolivian Congress yesterday  said of Latin America's 380 billion dlr foreign debt   Debtor countries and creditors must cooperate with the banks and international financial organizations to find long-term solutions.  Bolivia's debts total 4.4 billion dlrs.  We wish to reach a reasonable agreement with Bolivia so that the country can experience a significant financial respite   Weizsaecker said. The two countries earlier signed two technical and financial cooperation treaties. West German officials said aid last year included 35 mln marks in financial cooperation. Bolivian Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal told reporters West Germany would provide 300 mln marks to help fight Bolivia's cocaine trade. The illegal trade in cocaine is West Germany's most worrisome drug problem  West German officials said."
"2","Philippines Trade andIndustry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils. Concepcion  speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here  said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted. He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries. Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers  he noted that  I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.  He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices  but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.  The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed   he said."
"2","A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter  in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks  told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.  That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round   he said.  The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.  The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed  he said.  Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round   he said. But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.  It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two   he said.  They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future   he said."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasoneintervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade  government officials said. At today's Cabinet meeting  Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors. Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact  agreed last year after months of negotiations  calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday  Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter  the contents of which were released today  Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials  MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets."
"2","World Bank president Barber Conablepledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices  but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia  hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half  is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank  which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments  was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.  We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy   he said. He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis  and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports  encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However  key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country."
"2","Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumitasaid in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations. Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention  if necessary  in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada  Britain  France  Japan  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.  It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates   Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system  he said. The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries  the Paris statement said."
"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April.  We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date   he said.  I am not sure we can wait until late April   he added. Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries. Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors  Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka. The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country.  I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast   Yeutter said."
"2","Philippine Secretary ofTrade and Industry Jose Concepcion  who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences  said he was pleased with the latest gathering here. Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.  Also  the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries   he added in an interview with Reuters.  In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries   he said. Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a  shining act of faith  in the world trade system. Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive.

Canada  Britain  France  Japan  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.  It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates   Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system  he said. The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries  the Paris statement said."
"2","U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este  Uruguay  last September. Yeutter said  at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.  There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and  a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there   Yeutter said. However  the hard work is still to come  with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead  he said.  It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy   he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating  he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process  but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years  he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that  which is an ineffective use of financial resources  he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations  he said  one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasoneintervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade  government officials said. At today's Cabinet meeting  Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors. Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact  agreed last year after months of negotiations  calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday  Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter  the contents of which were released today  Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials  MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets."

I am not sure we can wait until late April   he added. Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries. Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors  Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka. The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country.  I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast   Yeutter said."

"2","A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter  in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks  told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.  That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round   he said.  The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.  The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed  he said.  Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.  But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.  It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two   he said.  They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future   he said."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conablelinked increased borrowing by Indonesia  the Third World's sixth largest debtor  to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers.  We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy   Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.  The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them   he stated. Indonesia  the only Asian member of Opec  has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken  including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah  and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.  The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world   he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel  plastics and cement  western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures  but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects  which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month."
"2","Indonesia's foreign debts are a causefor concern  but remain within manageable limits  World Bank President Barber Conable said. He told a press conference before leaving for Tokyo that Indonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and cause for concern. But he said it was not necessarily due to imprudent borrowing and  it is still within an area of being manageable.  The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts of around 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to a projected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88  from 25 pct in 1986/87 ending March 31. Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers. Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the rise in the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio by reducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments. Indonesian debt servicing of 6 760 billion rupiah takes up almost one third of the 1987/88 budget. Payment on the principal of government debts is officially projected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billion in 1986/87. Conable linked an increase in World Bank lending to Indonesia to implementation of further economic policy reforms."
"2","U.S. Department of Energy SecretaryJohn Herrington said he was  optimistic  about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers  but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration. Herrington  speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting  said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was  heavy and strong  largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry. Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports. In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp &lt;MND> chairman  George Mitchell  Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif.  We intend to keep that debate open   Herrington said. However  following his speech  Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee  is not economical.  Herrington said  for example  a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs. Herrington also said he believed President Reagan  who requested the comprehensive national security study  was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.  I'm quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it   Herrington said."
"2","A government-appointed specialprosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges over the closure of a private bank against Philippine central bank governor Jose Fernandez  who said he would contest the charges. Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence to indicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering the closure of &lt;Pacific Banking Corp> in July  1985. He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed  within the week  in a special court for corruption cases  adding that a defendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court. Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines' creditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of the country's foreign debt. A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying Pacific Bank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.  Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in the appreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing a motion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution   the statement said. Central bank sources said the statement was drafted after Fernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson  who is in Manila  conferred on the telephone. Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed after hearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug  the president of Pacific Bank's Employees Union. In her complaint  Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarily in ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it under receivership without giving the bank the right to appeal  throwing hundreds of employees out of work. Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholding in Far East Bank and Trust Company  which took over Pacific Bank's assets  when he became central bank governor in January  1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960. She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by appointing two Far East bank executives to central bank consultancies  giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She also disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts from January 1980 to May 1985  claiming the bank had made a profit  not a loss. The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing that Pacific Bank was  repeatedly given notice of the continuing losses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up additional capital to eliminate insolvency.  It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank of Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase Pacific Bank  but the negotiations collapsed  because of certain legal impediments.  The statement said the central bank invited several banks to submit offers for Pacific  and the sale to Far East was approved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone. Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had divested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he became central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman declined comment on the charges against Fernandez. In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending prosecution against Fernandez  Gonzalez said prima facie evidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then members of the country's Monetary Board  as well as the Far East executives  and ordered their investigation. He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political climate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.  (The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices was either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and his wife  to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens ... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any instructions from above   Gonzalez wrote. Gonzalez  named to his post 11 months ago  said his office had received more than 4 000 complaints of misuse of power. He said among those facing prosecution were five provincial governors appointed by President Corazon Aquino."
"2","A House taxwriter said EnergySecretary James Herrington's  outrageous  plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy. Rep. Pete Stark  a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member  said Herrington's plan for a 27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5 pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.  He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle   Stark said. He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an effective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment  15 pct versus aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct  according to a recent Congressional Research Service study."
"2","Nigeria and Britain signed an agreementto reschedule Nigeria's official debts in the first of an expected series of such talks  government sources said. The agreement was signed by Nigerian Finance Minister Chu Okongwu and the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) chief executive Jack Gill. The Nigerians will go on to Paris for similar bilateral talks tomorrow with Coface  the French export credit agency. Today's agreement follows an agreement between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt. The Paris Club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace. But as with all Paris Club pacts  specific interest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basis with the countries involved. None of the details contained in today's negotiations was immediately available. The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can be struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export credit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria. The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in 1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days  govenment sources said there had not been any discussions on new credits. Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official agencies under a structrual adjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to support a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt. But these credits cannot be approved until the export credit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts."
"2","South Africa will repay 13 pct of itsfrozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the next three years under an agreement reached today in London  Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said. He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the debt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30  1987.  These arrangements confirm South Africa's continued willingness to maintain good relations with its foreign creditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way   du Plessis told a news conference. Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was  substantially a continuation  of the arrangement ending in June and calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on its total foreign debt of 23 billion dlrs. The new debt standstill will extend from July 1  1987  to June 30  1990  with a three pct down payment permitted on July 15  1987   provided such debt has already reached maturity   du Plessis said. Finance Minister Barend du Plessis told a new conference that 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement  he said. Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a  good deal  both for South Africa and the banks and added that the three-year length of the agreement was of  enormous significance  to South Africa. Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a  good deal  both for South Africa and the banks. Besides the 13-billion-dlr frozen debt  South Africa also owes ten billion dlrs of debt that includes a significant amount of medium -term liabilities that will continue to be repaid on normal maturity dates. The 13 pct to be repaid under the standstill amounts to 1.42 billion dollars. A total of five pct or 508 mln dlrs will be repaid in the second half of 1987  with 3.5 pct or 400 mln dlrs in calendar 1988  three pct or 346 mln dlrs in calendar 1989 and 1.5 pct or 166 mln dlrs in the first half of 1990. Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement  he said. De Kock  speaking at the same news conference  said the three-year length of the agreement was of  enormous significance  to South Africa. De Kock said South Africa had negotiated from a  position of basic economic financial strength.   We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now underborrowed by all international criteria that I've ever heard of   he said. Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank  which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two months  and a continued current account surplus  will be sufficient  to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement. Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in the South African economy and country as a whole. He attributed this to  restoration of law and order which has greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the intensity of unrest.  South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June 1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over 2 400 lives in the past three years. Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks and South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good relations with its foreign creditors. He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign investors were again  taking a more realistic view  of South Africa. Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and the sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves. Of the 13 billion dlr frozen debt  3.5 billion dlrs was owed by the public sector and 9.5 billion dlrs by private industry  du Plessis said. The remaining 10 billion dlrs consisted of seven billion dlrs owed by government agencies and three billion dlrs by the private sector."
"2","France's economic recovery will takeseveral years  Finance Minister Edouard Balladur told the Economic and Social Council (CES)  an advisory body composed of industrialists  trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy.  We will bear for long years to come the weight of the choices made at the start of the oil crisis about 15 years ago  unfavorable choices for industries but favorable for households   he said without elaborating.  It is the cost of this choice that our industries are still having to bear. We must improve their competitivity to regain growth and employment   Balladur added. Balladur said the French budget deficit must be reduced to below 70 billion francs from 129 billion forecast for 1987 but he gave no time-scale. He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989. He said France's public debt  expected to grow by 10 pct this year compared with 1 300 billion francs in 1986  must not increase by more than between 60 to 70 billion francs a year. He reaffirmed that income from the government's sweeping privatization program  seen to be at least 30 billion francs for 1987  must be used mainly to pay off French state debt and not to finance current needs."
"2","President Reagan signed a billlimiting fees that may be charged by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) for its guarantees of privately issued mortgage-backed securities but voiced serious reservations about the measure. He said the bill's provision barring GNMA from increasing its current fee of .06 pct charged to issuers of single-family mortgage backed securities  is an unnecessary and risky congressional intrusion into GNMA's ability to respond quickly and flexibly to changes in financial markets.  Reagan said his reservations  must be addressed promptly through remedial amendments.  Reagan said the provision hampered GNMA's ability to maintain reserves necessary to meet its obligations   particularly in light of a disturbing increase in claims and in GNMA's contingent liabilities.  Reagan said the legislative cap on fees  could well call into question the adequacy of GNMA's  current reserve of 1.4 billion dlrs  given the 250 billion in GNMA-guaranteed securities presently outstanding and GNMA's monthly contingent liability of three billion dlrs.  Reagan said he had instructed Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce to work with Congress to draft revisions to the legislation."
"2","There is a good chance that the UnitedStates and Latin America will agree reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talks yesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.  This is a complex issue  but I am very optimistic on an agreement  he told reporters during the IADB's annual meeting here. The U.S.  which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank  has proposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct  a move strongly opposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct. Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when the issue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank interim meetings next month in Washington. He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America's position during talks yesterday with the so-called  A  countries - Brazil  Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffer a net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes a substantial capital increase. Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment of funds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90  plus 2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment. But Washington has previously said it would not agree to a nine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reforms were agreed  a position described today by Nicaragua's Central Bank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic. Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed  flexibility in being prepared to accommodate different proposals  and promised to look into alternatives. He said an alternative now being looked at was for new procedures for delaying IADB loan approval  to satisfy U.S. concern that lending is currently too lax  rather than a change in the basic voting structure. There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby it would need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for a year  after which a second review would require a 40 pct blocking vote.  Any change in the basic voting structure would require a change in the IADB's charter  and in turn a lengthy process of prior approval by the Congresses of each country   Petricioli said. In common with Venezuela  he expressed reservations on the conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington's proposals for increased IADB sectoral lending  but welcomed a bigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy."

"2","The chairman of the Federal ReserveBoard  Paul Volcker  has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday. Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms abroad. He added   even Japan  against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed   has started opening its markets. In his letter  made available at the Treasury  Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks  was a problem.  I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt   Volcker said. It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries  he said. Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker  about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt  which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility.  He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates  is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects.   For example  the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations   Volcker said. He recommended  we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations  on exchange rates but instead use other  more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies."

"2","China must cut excess demand and capitalinvestment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficits but will press ahead with wide-ranging economic reforms in 1987  Premier Zhao Ziyang told parliament. Zhao told the annual meeting of the National People's Congress that while China cooled its overheated economy  cut its trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986  serious imbalances remain. Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply  and demand for consumer goods  especially from state firms  is too high.  (They) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (and issue) excessive wage and bonus increases   he said. Failure to cut this excess will  result in reduced accumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality   Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low per capita incomes and excessively high consumer demand. China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction in its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption must match the available resources  he said. Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986 because of the sharp fall in world oil prices  the rising cost of foreign exchange earnings through exports  reduced income from customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending. Local authorities  departments and firms have been able to retain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979.  (They) unjustifiably developed processing industries and non-productive construction   Zhao said. He said that unless effective measures are taken to curb this practice  financial and credit deficits are likely to increase in the next few years. Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last too long  they will cause the over-issue of money  which in turn will cause  disturbing inflation  a precipitous rise in commodity prices and chaos in economic life.  Another serious problem is that too many new construction projects have been launched. Fixed asset investment outside the state plan is over-extended and the pattern of such investment is highly irrational  he said. Investment in energy  transport  telecommunications and raw and semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and investment in non-productive projects is too large  he said. Zhao said some departments and local authorities have failed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this investment imbalance  despite instructions to do so from the State Council earlier this year. He said China's per capita output of grain and other farm and sideline products is still very low and production of grain  forestry  animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a rather weak foundation. China's countryside is still in the development stage and there is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms  he said  but did not elaborate. Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe life into China's large and medium sized state firms  which still do not have  a satisfactory combination of responsibilities  powers and benefits.   We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises full managerial authority and full responsibility for their own profits and losses   he said. Currently  the firms are not responding rationally to market changes and doing all the state requires of them  he said. Their potential is not being fully tapped  he added. Zhao said that in 1987  China will speed up the reform of its financial system  diversify credit services  encourage competition among different financial institutions and promote insurance services. He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed  with differential and floating rates being applied for different periods of time. China must  under proper guidance  develop markets for the circulation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of financial markets in pooling and regulating funds  he added. Zhao said China must also expand the market for capital goods such as rolled steel  coal  cement and timber. The lack of such a market is the main reason why large state firms have  yet to be fully invigorated   he said. He also promised a continuation of the labour contract system under which all firms hire workers for a fixed period and pay them according to their own methods  subject only to state-set ceilings for wages and bonuses."
"2","Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang said thethreat from western political ideas which caused widespread student demonstrations last December has been curbed. In an address at the opening session of China's parliament  the National People's Congress  he accused unnamed party leaders of being weak and lax in their supervision of ideology and of failing to give full support to the promotion of Marxism.  After several months of work since the end of last year we have curbed bourgeois liberalisation  which was once quite widespread   he said."
"2","China should tighten imports of ordinarygoods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically  Premier Zhao Ziyang said. He told the National People's Congress  China's parliament  that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed.  We should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion   he said. On exports  China should increase its proportion of manufactured goods  especially textiles  light industrial goods  electronics and machinery  he said. Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986 China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs  down from a record 14 billion in 1985. Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen. It should use foreign funds for production and construction  with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes. China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad  he added."

"2","China's Premier Zhao Ziyang said thecountry must continue to reform its  irrational  price system although this will mean price rises and cause living standards for some people to fall. Zhao said China's price system is irrational due to  prolonged negligence of the law of value and due to the rigid and excessive state control.   The prices of farm products  energy  raw and semi-finished materials and other primary products have long been too low and many products have long been in short supply   he said. Price reforms are necessary to  establish a new vigorous socialist economic structure  to effectively promote production and commodity circulation and provide correct guidance to consumption   Zhao added. Reforms are bound to lead to a rise in the general price level but will only be implemented after careful studies so as to keep the increase within the capacity of society and the people  to withstand the strain.  He said the general price level will rise in 1987 less than in 1986  with price increases of a very small number of products."

"2","British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherdenied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices. She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea.  We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies   she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel. British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future  she said.  We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries   Thatcher said.  On our part  we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility."
"2","South Africa's new foreign debtagreement sparked a rally in local financial markets  but bankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of anxiety from a still depressed economy.  We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence' yet   commented one banker  who saw the agreement as having marginal influence on fundamental economic problems. Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and financial rand. The commercial rand  used for current account transactions  rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumped nearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts. All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take place through the financial rand  which is considered the main barometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseas investors. Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S. Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks. They said the financial rand in particular was being driven by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could favorably affect the currency. Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan balances and short-term claims into equity investments in South Africa. Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank was  investigating the implications of such conversions in light of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system.  Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that  some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view of South Africa.  Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay 1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the next three years. The agreement extends a standstill arrangement  expiring June 30  that has been in place since August  1985. Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the monetary authorities.  They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we offered the minimum   said one banking source  reacting to reports from London that creditors were hoping for larger repayments. Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa should have  no difficulty whatsoever  with the terms. Economists said the debt agreement would have no significant impact on economic problems continuing to face South Africa including high rates of inflation and unemployment  labour unrest and political uncertainty. Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton  speaking yesterday before the debt agreement  said the economy was  in bad shape  and there was  an awful lot of talk but little action  to cure serious problems."
"2","President Reagan opposed new taxesas he urged the Democratic controlled Congress to come up with a budget that meets the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of 108 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988.

Asked about taxes  he said  they're not going to get those either.  Reagan's appearance with Republicans coincided with a dispute among House Budget Committee Democrats and Republicans. Republicans have boycotted budget drafting sessions.  I'm still trying to get a budget that meets the Gramm-Rudman target   Reagan said.  The Democrats have refused to present a budget of their own.  House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray told reporters after Reagan's remarks that  They (Republicans) don't want to participate. The President is up there bashing our brains while Republicans won't give us a markup (drafting meeting). It's an interesting combination."

Tehran Radio  monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp  quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after its forces overran southern Iraq's Faw peninsula in February last year that it had shore-to-sea missiles.  The fact that the Americans  after so much delay  are now thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because Reagan needs this sensation now   said Mousavi  speaking after a cabinet meeting in Tehran.  We also announce today that these missiles are not the limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf   he added. Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to do with the U.S. But Iran would resort to any action to defend the Gulf   even those actions which are not thought probable by Westerners."
"2","Energy Secretary John Herrington hasproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production  but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. The White House  reacting  said it did not favor amending the tax code  but would look at the proposal. Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports  rapidly rising  could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production  not cause economic dislocation  and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test  spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120 000 oil workers to their jobs  but at the same time it lifted oil prices  the higher prices would cost 400 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline  he said  would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production. In any case  U.S. officials say  President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington's criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 000 barrels a day  at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. It would increase production by 80 000 barrels a day  at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas  which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf  which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil  and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  which may hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals  but added he hoped his department's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew  even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House  is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100 000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 000. This  he said  would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe administration is confident the effect of exchange rate changes will bring about a cut in the trade deficit this year.

"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat some of the trade bills proposed by Congress conflict significantly with certain basic principles the Reagan administration considers critical.

He told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch   I don't think anyone believes we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target.  Lyng said if the federal deficit came down  this would help exports.  A failure to get the fiscal deficit under control is having a harmful effect on agricultural exports.

He said that the debt initiative that bears his name is a long-term approach and that further progress  will be gradual and will vary among nations  depending upon their own determination to implement growth-oriented reforms and the continued active support of the international community."

Baker continued   We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels.  He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters. Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar.  I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements   Baker said. Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world's economy. He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth. Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final. Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation."
"2","The director of the Office ofManagement and Budget James Miller warned that a tax increase would jeapordise real U.S. economic growth.  It's a bad idea. We don't need more money to balance the budget. We need to reduce spending and avoid things that would halt economic expansion   Miller told students at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.  I think economic growth could be threatened mightily if we have a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving up on deficit reduction   he said. Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright to put a one pct tax on securities transactions. He said the tax would probably be ineffective because people would avoid by holding their portfolios in other instruments  like real estate  or simply by not trading as often. Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.  I think it is frankly all but political suicide to advocate a tax increase unless the president championed it as well   he said.  And he's not going to do it  in fact he would veto a tax increase   Miller added."

Lyng is believed to be the first top administration official to publicly express doubts the target would be met. The remark was quickly disavowed by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  His 'no one' does not include the OMB   said spokesman Edwin Dale. Lyng made the remark while describing the need for the agriculture sector to share the burden of cutbacks under last year's Gramm-Rudman law.  There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to at least get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure   he said.  Agriculture would not be independent from that.

"2","Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva said Portugal would hand back Macao to China on December 20  1999  but added the existing political  economic and social system there would be maintained until the year 2050. Cavaco Silva  speaking on national television hours before the initialling in Peking of an agreement on the handover  said that under the accord Macao would be a special administrative region of China and would have a large measure of autonomy. Under the accord  Portuguese administration of the territory would end on December 20  1999 but the existing system there would be maintained until the year 2050  Cavaco Silva said.  The existing way of life in Macao  the Portuguese laws  basically our political  economic and social system  will remain in force for a further 63 years from now   he said. Cavaco Silva said he would go to Peking in the first half of next month to formally sign the agreement with China  which would then be submitted to Portugal's parliament for approval. Cavaco Silva said that after Portuguese administration of Macao formally ended in 1999  the future government of the territory would enjoy complete autonomy except in the areas of defence and foreign relations. It would however be able to make economic  trade and finance agreements with other countries. The head of government would be named on the basis of elections held for the post. Macao would have an elected legislative assembly and an independent judiciary. There would be religious freedom  a free press and freedom of expression. The Portuguese language could continue to be used in the government  assembly and courts. Cavaco Silva said the current financial system would continue after the year 2000. The existing banks and freedom of capital movements would be maintained as would the convertibility of the pataca as the territory's monetary unit and the legal protection of foreign investment. Only the Macao government would be able to collect taxes. Cavaco Silva said that those among Macao's 400 000 population who held Portuguese nationality on the date of the handover would thereafter continue to be able to use their Portuguese passports and their nationality rights. The nationality issue had been one of the points of disagreement in the complex handover talks. The special administrative status to be granted to Macao after its handover mirrors a similar accord for the nearby British colony of Hong Kong  which reverts back to Chinese rule in 1997 under a 1984 Sino-British agreement."
"2","France's right-wing government nowexpects to raise about 40 billion francs this year from its privatisation program  10 billion more than it targetted  Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said. The success of the program  launched late last year  meant the government would be able to go beyond the 30 billion franc figure it estimated in its 1987 budget  he said in a television interview. About 75 pct of the additional revenue would be used to cut state debt and 25 pct to provide additional funds for public sector investment  he said. Chirac said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur proposed to make two billion francs of supplementary funding available for a five biillion franc accelerated motorway building program. The remaining three billion francs for this would come from a motorway loan now in the domestic market. Balladur also proposed to make some extra cash available to the French national railways  SNCF  for the construction of high-speed rail track  and to boost research in the aerospace industry  he added. An estimated 15 000 jobs would be generated by speeding up motorway construction  Chirac said. Reaffirming his long term strategy of cutting the state sector deficit and easing taxes  Chirac repeated government pledges to cut the corporate tax rate to 42 pct from 45 pct in the 1988 budget. Personal income tax would also be reduced but details had still to be worked out  he added. The government aimed to make France the leading economic power in Western Europe within five years  he told his television interviewer."
"2","Central Bank President Jose LuisMachinea said Argentina could adopt the same posture as Brazil and suspend payments on its foreign debt if it failed to meet creditor bank demands.  If Argentina had the same difficulties in being unable to refinance (its debt) under the desired (creditor) conditions  that (Brasil's) is a path to take   Machinea said. Brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its 109-billion dlr debt  the highest in the developing world. Machinea said Brasil did not suspend payments because it wanted to but because it lacked reserves. Argentina has since last month been negotiating a 2.15 billion dlr loan with the steering committee for its international creditor banks to meet 1987 growth targets. But Machinea said the talks were difficult and Argentina wanted to conclude them as soon as possible.  What the (creditor) banks are demanding is not the same as what Argentina is prepared to concede   Machinea said. Argentina has a global foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs. Its debt with private banks is about 30 billion dlrs."
"2","President Jose Sarney rejected callsfrom foreign creditors and from some Brazilian businessmen that the government talk to the International Monetary Fund.

"2","China posted a budget deficit of 7.08billion yuan in 1986  the fourth highest since 1949  after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985  Finance Minister Wang Bingqian told the National People's Congress. He put 1986 revenue at 222.03 billion yuan  against a budgeted 214.17 billion  and up from 185.41 billion in 1985  and expenditure at 229.11 billion  against a budgeted 214.17 billion and 182.59 billion in 1985. Official figures show the record post-1949 budget deficit was 17 billion yuan in 1979. Wang said the 1986 deficit was due to excess capital construction and administrative expenses and unjustified and extravagant investments outside the state plan. He also blamed the inefficiency of firms whose production costs and losses rose. He said subsidising state firms' losses cost 32.25 billion yuan. The 1985 budget did not give a separate figure for this. He said the processing industry developed too fast and some projects could not start operations because of power shortages  while too many non-productive facilities were set up. Wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose 15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumption funds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct  outstripping the growth in national income. Wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in world oil prices  the decline in the price of primary products  a drop in income from customs duties and the rising cost of earning foreign exchange through exports. Revenue also fell because the state raised the rate of depreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms  reduced their regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms. Wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuan from 201.82 billion in 1985  state treasury bond receipts to 6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loans rose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion. He said 1986 budgetary spending on capital construction rose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985  on technical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from 10.05 billion  aid to rural production and other farm expenses to 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion  culture  science  education and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billion and defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion. Wang said expenditure for repaying principal and interest on foreign loans in 1986 was 3.4 billion yuan  up from 3.26 billion in 1985."

"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidbanks must do more lending to developing countries. Baker  in an interview on Cable News Network  was asked about such loans after Standard and Poor's Corp today downgraded the debt of six major money centre bank holding companies  largely because of their heavy loan exposure to developing nations. Baker said developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as that of the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in those countries' economic systems. The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said developing nations'  investment regimes do not support enough equity investment  so you've got to have some debt there."

"2","Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumitasaid a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy. He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures  including market intervention  to stabilize exchange rates if necessary  in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last. Six major nations - Britain  Canada  France  Japan  the U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable. Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan. He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased. To prevent a resurgence of inflation  the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions  he said. He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand. Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen  Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency's weakness. The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension  he said. Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending April 1  1988  provided exchange rates stabilize."
"2","The European Community (EC) considerstalks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round  Willy de Clercq  external relations commissioner of the EC  said. He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early  seperate agreement on agricultural trade. He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este  Uruguay  last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT. Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services. De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand. Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative  Clayton Yeutter  also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible. But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations  and the EC did not want changes.  We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached  and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks  no fast track  no slow track. It has just one track  the track - and that's all   de Clercq said.  If you start selecting priorities  your priority is not my priority. We say that agriculture is urgent  but it's not the only urgent thing   he said. He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months to prepare and eight days of negotiations."

"2","The latest round of talks betweenPhilippine officials and the country's commercial bank creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt are still proceeding  but with a narrower focus  Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said. He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has dropped a two-tier interest payment offer  which would have given banks a higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippine investment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.  The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion is now on pricing (of just the cash payments)   he said. Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the Philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8 over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would not discuss details of the pricing negotiations. He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement might be reached. The talks have been going on for more than three weeks. Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8 over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable  dollar-denominated  zero coupon notes that could potentially yield up to one point over LIBOR. The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at least a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had grave reservations  seeing it as a possible precedent for other large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash. The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a separate option for those banks  which might want to fund their own investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the secondary market  Ongpin said. Under Manila's plan  the PINs would be redeemable at full face value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments at any time prior to their six-year maturity date. While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs proposal  Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of certain investment banks which are already active in the secondary market for sovereign debt. Unlike current debt/equity schemes  Ongpin said  the PINs would include no government fees and would be free from  administrative hassles.  He said about six investment banks had been approached and four had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45 mln dlrs worth of notes  he said. Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in the secondary market through the PINs scheme  the Philippines could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring period."
"2","Peruvian President Alan Garcia saidhis government was not trying to convince other nations to follow its decision to limit foreign debt repayments.  We do not want to export a model   Garcia told a press conference at the end of an official two-day visit to Mexico yesterday. He was referring to Peru's policy of limiting payments on its 14 billion dlr debt to 10 pct of its export earnings. Peru's attitude contrasts with that of Mexico  which followed a more conciliatory route and last week signed a 7.7 billion dlr loan package with its creditor banks. Since it decided to put a ceiling on debt payments  Peru has been barred from International Monetary Fund lending. Despite their different approaches to debt  Garcia and Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid issued a joint declaration yesterday calling the foreign debt problem an  expression of the present unjust international economic order.  But the declaration said that no Latin American debtors' club was about to appear.  We affirm the sovereignty of our economic decisions and the capacity for mobilising our own resources   it said.

"2","China will have a budget deficit of8.017 billion yuan in calendar 1987 compared with a 7.08 billion deficit in 1986  Finance Minister Wang Bingqian said. He told the National People's Congress  the State Council has decided to cut nearly all 1987 budgetary expenditures by 10 pct from the 1986 level. He said expenditures for the past two years have been inflated. Investment by localities in capital construction in 1987 must fall by 50 pct from the 1986 level and state firms must cut their losses by 30 pct  he said. China will use 14.6 billion yuan in foreign loans in 1987  up from 7.87 billion in 1986  Wang said. It must cut back on investment in capital construction  especially construction outside the state plan  he said. Funds must go into energy  transport  telecommunications  raw and semi-finished materials and not into non-production sectors.  In view of the country's financial difficulties this year  it has been decided that seven billion yuan of the budgetary allocation for capital construction will be raised by the People's Bank through loans and the issuing of bonds   he said. Wang said all localities and departments must strictly confine their 1987 capital investment to the amount set out in the state budget  a 50 pct reduction from 1986 levels. He said that because of financial difficulties  the state cannot increase spending on culture  education  science and public health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past few years. Expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct. The only allocations not to be affected by the general 10 pct cutback are subsidies for price rises  repayment of principal and interest on domestic and foreign loans  funds for the disabled and spending for other social relief. Wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pct from the 1986 level  overhead expenses by 10 pct and raw material consumption by two pct. Commercial firms must cut their deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct. He said violations of financial and economic discipline are common  including tax evasion  false accounting  embezzlement  theft  extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. Such practices  have reached very serious proportions in some areas  departments and units  and must be dealt with seriously  he said. Wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans have been arranged according to the 1986-90 plan  with 3.2 billion going to pay for foreign equipment in the Baoshan steel plant near Shanghai. He said China is running no risk in using more foreign loans  provided it prepares careful feasibility studies  borrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only to develop production in priority sectors. Wang said China plans to levy new taxes on the use of arable land for non-farm purposes starting this year. Half the revenue generated will go to the state and half to localities to be used in the development of agriculture. The only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used to cover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big and medium-size state firms and textile and other light industries. The money will also pay for increases in the state purchasing prices of some grain  cotton and oil-yielding crops  he said."

"2","World Bank president Barber Conable saidhe was concerned about the state of Brazil's economy and urged the country to come up with a plan soon to put its economic house in order.  I am very concerned about the Brazilian economy   he told reporters after a news conference in Tokyo. He said Brazil had caught the attention of the world with its decision last month to stop paying interest on its loans from commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time it gained by failing to come up with a new economic program. Brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community as the country is 108 billion dlrs in debt  including some 68 billion owed to commercial banks. Brazilian Finance Ministry sources said in Brasilia yesterday that the country was preparing a new economic strategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth. Despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure  Brazil has said repeatedly that it will not go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help in drawing up a new plan for fear that will only throw its economy into recession. Conable said the country may be able to get away with not going to the IMF for help  but will need an IMF-type economic program if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders. Outsiders like the World Bank are reluctant to suggest possible solutions to Brazil's economic problems because of the delicate political situation there  he added. While the World Bank has a role to play in helping Brazil  it can&#127;ot replace the IMF as an overseer of the economy  Conable said. He added that the Fund can be very flexible in its dealings with developing countries  adjusting its approach to the political realities. Brazil still seems willing to talk to the Fund under the annual discussions that all IMF members undertake  Conable said  adding that this could partially solve the current stalemate. During his news conference  Conable said the World Bank backed U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's Third World debt initiative  which calls for stepped up lending to heavily indebted Third World countries adopting economic policies.  The World Bank believes the Baker initiative is the best approach   he said.  Debt forgiveness is difficult to design in any fair way and also will tend to discourage further investment and development.  He cited the recent multi-billion dollar debt package for Mexico  the Third World's most indebted country after Brazil.  Will it work?  he asked.  We don't know...But we think it more likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested.  Conable  who is here to meet government and business leaders  expressed confidence that Japan will make increasing use of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.  We are quite confident Japan will make an increasing investment in development because of their willingness to support institutions like ours in increasing ways with each passing year   he said."

This principle has become a dividing  and therefore a weakening  factor for the market   Balladur said. He said under the planned new rules  stock brokers  currently very specialised and undercapitalised  would be free to link up with powerful financial institutions after a five-year transition period. Stock brokerages would be subject to legislation similar to that in the U.K. And U.S.  He said  adding the Paris market would actively attempt to attract foreign securities houses. Balladur said the French securities market had enjoyed strong growth in the past 10 years  with new share and bond issues totalling 430 billion French francs in 1986  compared with 53 billion in 1976. New share issues alone totalled 63 billion francs in 1986  up 230 pct from the 1985 level of 19 billion francs  he said. Total market capitalisation stood at 3 200 billion francs at end-1986  compared with 400 billion 10 years earlier  while stock and bond trades were valued at 2 200 billion francs last year against 56 billion in 1976  he said. Balladur  who also had private talks with U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  said his government was also preparing a bill to liberalise the French insurance sector. Under the proposed rules  an independent regulatory insurance commission will be set up. The commission will be endowed with powers similar to those of a body set up earlier to monitor the banking sector  Balladur said. He said the new bill would also aim to adapt insurance regulation to take account of the ever-closer integration of all areas of finance."
"2","The French government will present toparliament a major bill within two months to overhaul the Paris stock market  economics and finance minister Edouard Balladur said. Balladur told an Economist conference that on the product side  a series of new contracts  including share options and forward contracts in European Currency Units (ECUs)  would be introduced shortly for trading on the Paris bourse. The scope of the new bill  however  was to transform the organisation of equity trading  allowing participants both to perform a banking role and to trade in equities  he said."
"2","Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saidthe U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets. She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case.  I wrote to the prime minister of Japan  Mr Nakasone  on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is   Thatcher said. Thatcher told Parliament that  shortly ... We shall have more powers than we have now  when  for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available  then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do.  Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa. But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company."
"2","The Polish government has backed downfrom some proposed price rises in the face of strong opposition from trade unions  but has restated its commitment to economic reforms entailing tougher discipline and austerity measures. Following a warning from the officially-backed OPZZ unions that sharp price hikes could spark confrontation  the government has agreed that food prices this year will rise an average 9.6 pct instead of the planned 13 pct. A statement last night said the government had  partially accepted  demands for the protection of the low-paid and agreed to extend some social benefits. But Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski  at a separate meeting yesterday  sharply criticised the slow pace of reforms. He told an economic commission that tougher discipline and austerity measures  greater efficiency and initiative should replace waste  red tape and inertia. He announced cost-cutting measures affecting central administrative bodies. OPZZ economic expert Zbigniew Kochan welcomed the move on food prices.  This decrease was considerable   Kochan told Reuters today.  Also important is the fact that the government admitted we were right and agreed to consult us over prices from now on   he added. The communique made no mention of curbs on wage increases  or price rises in sectors including transport and energy. The authorities have said prices could go up by as much as 26 pct as state subsidies are sharply reduced in an effort to make the market more free and to improve efficiency. The OPZZ unions are officially recognised by the government and replaced the Solidarity movement suppressed under martial law. They claim a membership of seven million. Western diplomats said today the climb-down on food prices was a limited concession.  This is a small price to pay if they can push through the other price rises   one said  adding that fuel and energy rises would have a more significant effect. He noted that there had been a concerted media campaign to prepare people for price rises  including a major article in a mass-circulation women's magazine   clearly aimed at those who do the shopping   he said. Other articles in the official press this week have focused on coal  which sells to both industrial and private consumers at far less than either the production or export costs. Countering scepticism from opposition sources and former Solidarity activists as to OPZZ's role  Kochan said  It was definitely not a question of gaining credibility  but true concern for people's living standards.  Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Koziol said the authorities' main aim was not to harm workers' living standards. But he was also quoted by the official PAP news agency as saying the government had to take current economic realities into account."

"2","Bank of England Governor RobinLeigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that  we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding  on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy.  I would concede that  since the Louvre Accord  we are acting as if we are in something   Leigh-Pemberton said.  The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together  towards stabilising exchange rates   Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week's intervention by central banks to support the dollar  after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that  the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days  before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations  and noted that  we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.  He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations  and noted that  we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.  Leigh-Pemberton said that  in principle  the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling  provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower  he said  the two half point cuts (this month in banks' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.  Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a  cautious step-by-step approach  to reducing short term interest rates  not least because  we have a potential problem with inflation.  Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct   one of the highest  among industrialised nations  he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17  but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling's relationship with oil  Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling index  when compared with the index's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index  base 1975  closed here today at 72.1  unchanged from the previous close."
"2","Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker said he opposes legislation to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets. In a letter to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St. Germain  Volcker warned that it could lead to retaliation against U.S. firms already operating in other countries. The committee approved the legislation yesterday. They said its impact would be felt only by Japanese firms designated as primary dealers in U.S. government securities since other countries would meet the equal access rule.  Even Japan  at which the proposal seems to be particularly aimed  has made a number of advances in opening its market to U.S. firms   Volcker said. The legislation gives the administration six months to negotiate equal access for U.S. firms in the foreign government securities markets before the ban on foreign dealers in the U.S. would take effect. Volcker said more progress could be made by continuing negotiations without adopting the bill's more rigid approach. An aide to Rep. Charles Schumer  the New York Democratic sponsor  said it is expected to pass in the House trade bill."

While the plan would allow actual 1988 defense spending to rise by 5.6 billion dlrs  domestic spending would be increased by a disprportionate 42.7 billion dlrs  he said.

"2","The White House Economic PolicyCouncil decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement  industry sources said. They would give no details  noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision  but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so  after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July  Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return  the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries  and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods  such as televisions  video cassette recorders and computers."

"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has toldhis ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with a draft economic package in early April in time for his visit to Washington starting on April 29  government officials said. Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) to work closer with the LDP to work out a full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six industrial countries  the officials told Reuters. The date for the government to announce its package  based on the LDP's suggested measures  is not yet known but it may be before the fiscal 1987 budget passes the Parliament around late May  the officials said. The government has said in the past the package should come after the passage of the budget. But calls have grown at home and abroad for the government to announce it earlier as budget debates have been stalled by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest at a planned five pct sales tax. EPA chief Tetsuo Kondo told a press conference he sees a need to work on the economic plan early although the government's stance on the date for the plan remains the same  an EPA spokesman said. Projected measures include promoting house construction  infrastructure and urban development  he quoted Kondo as saying. Under last month's Paris currency agreement  Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic plan to stimulate domestic demand  increase imports and so help reduce its huge trade surplus.

"2","World Bank President Barber Conablecalled on Japan to boost investment in developing nations  for its own sake as well as that of the world economy.  Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World   he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics.  I would be pleased with additional support.  With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets  Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads  bridges and other infrastructure  he said. Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage. It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America  China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world  he said. Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate  the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate  the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  Conable noted. Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans  designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade.  Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future  though maybe not this year   Conable told Reuters after his speech.

"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willvisit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies  but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans  Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen  they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month  more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term  the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed  Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans  without losing face in parliament over the budget  political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations  deregulation  measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices  and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half  probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan  who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures  Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy  officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible  they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring  officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output  or gross national product  around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus  which measures trade in goods and services  amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen  to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993  from 150 now."
"2","Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreousaid today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens  the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.  He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean.  The air force  navy and army are in a state of alert   General Guven Ergenc  Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff  told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1  escorted by an unspecified number of warships  would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests  because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements.  Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels  he said  If there is an attack  it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war.  But he added  We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights.  Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens  Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations  we will hinder it  of course not with words  as it cannot be stopped with words.  Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move  saying only  The Greek fleet is not at its naval base.  Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey  the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war  Papandreou replied  Obviously  and perhaps even before the war."

Reagan in a message to Congress said he had an alternative proposal that would authorize 66 billion dlrs over five years  the same levels as in the Senate-passed version of the bill. He said he recognized the states were rapidly running out of highway funds and the legislation needed to make funds available for the 1987 construction season. He said was no reason why Congress could not send a new bill that he could sign before the spring construction season was any further along.

"2","New Irish Prime Minister CharlesHaughey  faced with a debt-ridden economy  will have to produce a harsh budget next week to impress financial markets  appease political opponents and maintain his tenuous hold on power  analysts said. For Haughey  who failed to win an overall majority in last month's election  only scraped back into power when the speaker in parliament stepped in with his casting vote to decide a tied vote on who would be the next Prime Minister. Heading a minority government and faced with a stagnant economy weighed down by debt  he has little room for manoeuvre. The national debt has now reached 24.3 billion punts -- 10 000 dlrs for every man  woman and child on the island and per capita three times the size of Mexico's. Its 19 pct unemployment rate is one of the highest in the European Community and 30 000 youngsters emigrate every year. The 58 pct income tax level could hardly be raised again. Haughey  declining to be tied down on specifics  promised on the election trail to get Ireland out of the debt trap with an annual growth rate of 2.5 pct  compared to central bank predictions of 1.5 pct. Jobs were his top priority  he said. For his crucial first budget  Haughey has ruled out any increase in the level of government borrowing and forecast  widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across the board.  Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some of the 187 000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annual public wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.  The big question now is to what extent he will grasp the nettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget   said Kevin Barry  economist with National and City Brokers.  You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR) substantially and swiftly. He has to do it now   Barry said. Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts  he said  Two billion would be good news. The markets are already taking the view it is going to be tough.   He has absolutely no room to maneouvre. He cannot spend to stimulate the economy. I don't see any good news in the short-term.  But he  like other analysts  rules out a debt-servicing crisis that would mean calling in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  It's too easy to borrow aboard   he added. The steady rise of sterling  the currency of one of Ireland's main trading partners  has been a boost to Irish exporters with the country recording a 31 mln punt trade surplus in February  the 10th surplus in a row. Political uncertainty is not a major factor for the punt because the main political parties are all essentially conservative with no major economic policy switches expected. New Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes  who replaced ousted Prime Minister Garret Fitzgerald at the head of the main opposition party  has pledged to back Haughey's budget if  as expected  he gets tough. Haughey is four short of an overall majority and would have to rely on the support of independent deputies if all four opposition parties united to vote against him. But in today's climate of economic austerity  few politicians would risk returning to the polls so soon and Haughey could cling to power for at least another two years if he brings in a belt-tightening budget next week  political commentators say. The debt-laden economy is the great national preoccupation  pushing firmly into the background for now Haughey's ultimate dream of a united Ireland with the British out of the north. H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly  one of the most successful Irishmen in international business  stressed the need for a frontal attack on the national debt  arguing  many of our children have lost faith in the future.   Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or a precipitous decline in our parities  the effect on our economy and on the provision of services by our government would be catastrophic   he said. This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond its means with a state spending spree on welfare benefits that could not be financed by economic growth."

Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors. The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers  television receivers and laser-printers  with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms  including NEC Corp  Hitachi Ltd  Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.

Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after  just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday  Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement  hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations  called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister  Hajime Tamura  who earlier today said Japan was ready to take  appropriate measures  if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT  the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade  if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  they said. If that article were invoked  GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided.  It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date   Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday  President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips  MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users  some of whom are also leading producers  to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies  Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise."
"2","Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou haswithdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased. A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday  avoiding a potential clash. Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday. The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri  north of Athens  saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid. Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord  Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened. The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean. Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement. Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row."
"2","Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates. The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week  he said. He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. Over semiconductors. The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring  he said."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidthat the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand. He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget. The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax."
"2","Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate  he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation  with money supply growth accelerating  he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices  exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far  Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall  he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand  he said."

Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain  Canada  France  Japan  the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates. Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord  he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially. But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate. Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market."
"2","Indonesia has minimised the economicimpact of falling oil prices  kept inflation within limits and boosted exports  Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices  which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow  against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct  he said  although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia  a major producer of rubber  palm oil  tin  timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar  which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook  the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt  estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.  About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden   the paper said. However  end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline  dealers said. Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation. A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1 400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market."
"2","Remarks by Japan's Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading  dealers said. After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering  they said.  I think (Nakasone's) desperate   said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager. Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen.

His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen   said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen. Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S. And Japan will continue to depress the dollar. The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit  they said."
"2","Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin saidPhilippine Investment Notes (PINs)  to be offered to commercial bank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt rescheduling  would revive the Baker Plan. PINs are tradable  foreign currency-denominated financial instruments with a six-year maturity  designed for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved equity investments within the Philippines. Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the government was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs worth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year. The plan  outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago  stalled because commercial banks balked at the idea of lending additional money  Ongpin said. It had called for substantial new commercial bank lending and development bank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their economic troubles. The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed by these debtor nations  provided they are willing to welcome foreign equity investment into their economies  Ongpin told a businessmen's meeting.  And this can now be achieved without forcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending.  Bankers in New York said given the booming market in debt-equity swaps  PINs ought to work if Manila issues the notes at an appropriate discount. Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated savings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year life. The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt  3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between January 1987 and December 1992  and 925 mln dlrs of new money lent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs. Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was better than Mexico's seven-year grace period  while the PINs proposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and generate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic enterprises. Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt  as well as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western creditor governments in January  was expected to reduce the country's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its current level of 40 to 45 pct. He said the country's balance of payments was now projected at a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987  compared with a surplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous projected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year. The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three times before the final agreement was struck last Friday  Ongpin said.  What we have now is PINs IV   he said. Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain terms better than those granted last year to Mexico  which won a 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.  And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money cross the table even as of today   Ongpin said  adding he expected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483 creditor banks worldwide. He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with President Corazon Aquino  particularly when the banks began to take a very tough stance on pricing.  But the President's instructions were unequivocal and unwavering  'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care how long it takes. Get a green card if you have to  but don't come home without a deal we can all be proud of'   he said."

"2","French Prime Minister Jacques Chiraccalled on leading Western nations to set up a mechanism which would put a stop to volatile foreign exchange rates. In a speech prepared for delivery to businessmen and bankers in New York  Chirac said said monetary stablility was a key element in bringing the world financial system back to health.  The industrialized states should agree to set up a monetary framework which would provide the necessary stability as well as sufficient flexibility to allow ajustments when needed   Chirac said.  This requires a monitoring and alert mechanism which would permit a timely and concerted reaction   he said. The prime minister  on the first day of a three-day visit to the United States  said the February 22 Paris accords agreed by the  Group of Five  industrial nations should serve as a basis for the new mechanism. Under the Paris accords  the United States  Britain  France  West Germany  and Japan agreed to stabilize exchange rates around existing parities. But  only five weeks after they were signed  they have failed to stop the dollar tumbling to record lows against the yen. Chirac said the means to monitor exchange rate movements were readily available.  What is needed is the political will to use these more completely  in the spirit of the Paris accords...   In other points of his speech  Chirac called on countries with high trade surpluses -- an apparent reference to Japan -- to open up their markets and stimulate demand. He warned the United States that protectionist measures as debated in the U.S. Congress would bring a tough  response from the 12-nation European Community.  Europe is very sensitive to every rumour of protectionism. It will react with energy and solidarity because it does not want to ruin its chances of recovery.  The Reagan administration is seeking to tone down a tough trade bill which if passed would require the president to retaliate against countries deemed to discriminate against U.S. Goods. Chirac also appealed for an effort from developed countries to help the Third World by reducing interest rates and stimulating commodity prices.  No stock-pile mechanism can run counter to the underlying trend of the market. These agreements must be complemented by financial aid to the developing countries hardest hit by the decline.  Chirac said he hoped concrete steps could be reached on these issues at forthcoming international meetings -- the International Monetary Fund/World Bank session in Washington and the June summit of seven leading western nations in Venice."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands  Lawson replied   we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.  When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris  Lawson said  I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement  so as not to make it easy for  speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors  Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.  It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented  just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented   Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury Committee  Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's current level  adding that  It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level.  He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices  largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully.  There has been a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals   Lawson said.  He disagreed with what he termed  the grossly exaggerated claim  that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London  Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that  over the medium and longer term  the government's objective is zero inflation.  He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP  is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.   He added that  to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation."

The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside competition. Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of attempts by Britain to achieve that  Howard said  I am not sure it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a personal interest in this problem.  I don't understand it to be closed at all.  Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be  talking to them about it (the letter)  finding out exactly what they do mean about it  and making it plain that we take a very serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as free as we allow access to our markets to be.  He noted that under the new Financial Services Act  Britain could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon.  I hope it won't come to that  and I don't think it will   Howard added. During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo Stock Exchange  the Ministry of Finance  the Trade Ministry  and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa. Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese telecommunications industry. Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined again today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war. This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war. He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain believed a  sensible solution  could be found which would open Japanese markets to British goods. Government officials were at pains today to deny that Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise similar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms. They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not necessarily constitute a deadline. Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against Japanese banks  insurance and investment institutions. But despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade elsewhere in Europe  Howard said he did not expect the move to backfire. He said in a radio interview today   it is true that we benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose those advantages. And I am sure they are making their views plain to the Japanese government on this matter.  Howard  who will also be visiting South Korea before returning to London on April 11  said his trip to Tokyo was planned well before the current trade row. Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global markets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a cooperation between national regulatory bodies. He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging information to combat financial fraud would be sought with Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between Britain and the United States."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conableexpressed concern that trade protectionism  at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan  might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters  Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets  arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth.  We have  in fact  been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time   he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was  a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.  The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium  Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank  which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams  roads and sewers  will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans  in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets  encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy.  We're comfortable with adjustment lending  we expect  however  that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio   Conable said. He made clear  however  that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted   the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.  Conable  is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October  1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based  in part  on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable  and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities.  I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow   Conable said. However  he said  I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.  He said  however  that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency  the International Monetary Fund  was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level  Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that  I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.  He added   so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution.  On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa  Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region  noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations  like those in the Sub-Sahara  during next week's meetings."
"2","Fox Broadcasting  owned by RupertMurdoch's News Corp Ltd  is set to launch two prime time television shows this Sunday on what some have called the fourth television network. The company  built around Murdoch's two billion dlr acquisition of seven television stations last year  marks the first network startup since 1948  when ABC  now owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB>  hit the airwaves.  I think our goal  more than anything else  is to provide an alternative to the three networks   said Fox president Jamie Kellner. Fox's debut comes when earnings at two of the three networks are under pressure and network advertising dollars have been growing slowly.  The barriers to entry are exceptionally high   industry analyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence said.  Their (Fox) saving grace is that their parent has deep pockets.  The question television industry  advertising and Wall Street executives are asking is whether this new entry can lure advertisers from the big three: CBS Inc &lt;CBS>  ABC  and NBC  a unit of General Electric Co &lt;GE>. Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in 1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier  with NBC accounting for all of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined  analysts noted.  They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as the traditional networks   said Jon Mandel  associate media director at Grey Advertising Inc. But James Mandelbaum  a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney said   If they have enough money  they have a good chance of making it work.  Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects to lose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mln dlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn a profit. To succeed  the company must also win over the young viewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows  two of which debut this Sunday  and another  next weekend. The first Fox-produced program --  The Late Show   featuring comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall on Fox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although the show has dropped recently in ratings  it still has a captive young audience in the late night time slot  analysts said. Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy   Married ... with Children   which Kellner describes as an alternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks. It is also airing  The Tracy Ullman Show   featuring the British comedienne  singer and actress. Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around the U.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiated stations. To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs  the company is taking the unprecedented step of airing them three times in the course of the evening.  I believe if some of their shows were on the traditional networks  it would be extremely high-rated   Mandel said  who added that his firm has signed up several million dlrs in advertising for the shows. But some question whether Fox will really become a fourth network. Robert Adler  president of the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau  said many cable shows are geared to the audience Fox is attempting to win.  There are already many alternatives out there to the three networks   he said. And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Fox the competition. An ABC spokesman said   the schedule we've put together for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox's programming schedule into account.  But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping a eye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and with its advertisers. Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Asked whether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday's debut  Kellner said   the last thing I want to do is worry about ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told me to do."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Bakerreiterated his hope that this week's rise in prime rates would be a temporary blip upwards.  I would hope that it would simply be a temporary blip upward as we've seen in the past   Baker said in television interview with the Cable News Network. The interview airs tomorrow but CNN released extracts from his remarks today. Baker also repeated his position that the reaction of financial markets to U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods showed  the importance of the United States not going protectionist. The markets were telling us...be careful."
"2","President Reagan set theExport-Import Bank's direct loan ceiling in fiscal year 1987 at 800 mln dlrs  a decrease of 100 mln dlrs. In a letter to Congress  Reagan also said he was not seeking any additional legislation to rescind any authority of the bank  which aids U.S. exports. Reagan said he had concluded that the statutory 1987 limit for Eximbank loan guarantee commitments should not be changed  noting that  continued growth in the U.S. economy and global recovery could create unexpected demand for guarantees and insurance."
"2","President Alan Garcia said he sought todeepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance  possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank. In a televised address tonight  he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans.  We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt   he said. Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings  effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. But tonight Garcia said:  We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others  and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us.  The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr debt. Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year. He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1 260 intis per month  benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln. Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements. He also said the price of petrol  frozen since August 1  1985  would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective. Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue earner  traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos  liquour and cigarettes would also go up  he said  without specifying the amount. Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate. The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80. To encourage private investment  he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government. He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government."
"2","The Central Bank has approved theconversion of 80.7 mln dlrs worth of Philippine debt into equity in local projects under a debt-to-equity swap program started last August  Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said. He told reporters the amount represented 57 transactions involving diversified investments. He said 90 applications to convert 316.7 mln dlrs of debt have so far been received by the Central Bank. Ongpin also said the International Finance Corp (IFC)  a World Bank affiliate  would invest up to 12.5 mln dlrs in the First Philippine Capital Fund. The fund  to be launched jointly by New York investment house Shearson Lehman Brothers and IFC  was proposed by Ongpin during a trip to the United States in September. There was still no word on when the fund  designed to encourage private sector investment in the Philippines  would be launched. A telex from IFC to Ongpin said the IFC investment will consist of exchanging up to 12.5 mln dlrs face value of Philippine debt it holds. The capital fund and the Central Bank's debt conversion plan are both aimed at reducing the country's debt burden by enabling interested investors to buy government notes at a discount  repatriate these and convert them at full value in pesos. The proceeds will then be used to investing in local projects. The country's foreign debt now stands at 27.8 billion dlrs."
"2","Philippine officials will meet major aiddonors in May to discuss a 500 mln dlr funding for an extensive land reform program  Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said. He told a news conference he had planned to sit down with a consultative group of major donors led by the World Bank late this month in Tokyo but said the documentation of the project would not be ready until the end of this month.  The World Bank has recommended that we meet some time in the second half of May because it is pointless to have that meeting unless the participants have had adequate time to review the documentation   he said. Government officials said the progam  estimated to cost 36 billion pesos  aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land  including some 50 000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. The new plan will include not only rice and corn land but also sugar and coconut plantations. It is expected to benefit about three mln impoverished peasants. Ongpin said earlier there was strong interest in the program from donors but said given the substantial financial requirements of the plan  the government could not rely on only one source but on a combination of sources. President Corazon Aquino approved last month the use of an estimated 20 billion pesos from the proceeds of the sale of certain non-performing assets to private companies. Ongpin said he has asked Aquino to consider two other sources  namely the proceeds from the sale of government corporations which are to be privatised and proceeds from the liquidation of seized Marcos-related assets. He also said he would recommend public hearings before such a big project was legislated.  If we get a good reception in the public hearings  perhaps then the President might feel persuaded that it is not necessary to wait for the Congress   he said. Aquino had said she would prefer that legislation for the program be approved by a two-house Congress  whose members will be elected on May 11. But her advisers are trying to persuade her to implement the program before the Congress convenes in July."
"2","British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership  has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election  due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson  in answer to a question  told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism  there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered  he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system  he noted.  We have to make sure it would work.  But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency  which he said was diminishing.  That argument has clearly weakened   he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review."
"2","European Community (EC)finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence  officials said.  There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System  with all that implies   Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency  the West German mark  sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable  both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister  whose country presently holds the presidency of the community  made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration.  We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system   Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to  dedramatise  realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However  West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany  with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul."
"2","Western creditorgovernments have reached agreement in principle on new proposals for easing the debt burden of sub-Saharan African countries  British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He told journalists the accord  reached in the so-called Paris Club of western governments  calls for rescheduling the debts of sub-Saharan African countries over very long periods and on very favourable terms. The proposals will be put forward for discussion at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank Development Committee in Washington next week  he said. Lawson said that under the proposals countries could have 15 or 20 years to repay their debts along with have a grace period. But he added the favourable terms would not be offered indiscriminately to all nations in the region but granted on a case-by-case basis. The Paris Club groups Western governments -- as opposed to commercial banks -- which are owed money by poorer nations. Lawson was speaking after an informal gathering of European Community finance ministers and central bankers held to prepare for discussions on international monetary issues and Third World debt at next week's spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he had insisted at the gathering that developed countries take adequate account of the problems facing poorer nations that were trying to put their ailing economies in order. He told journalists he would be unveiling new proposals for dealing with the Third World debt problem in  Washington. He declined to give details but Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens  who hosted the talks  indicated that Balladur's proposals involved giving a greater role to a World Bank fund used to compensate developing countries for falls in the prices of their main commodities.  The French ideas got a very sympathetic welcome   Eyskens told a news conference. He said the European Community felt a new IMF (International Monetary Fund) report which forecasts inflation-adjusted economic growth of just 2.5 pct in the industrialised world this year  compared with 3.1 pct expected last autumn  was slightly too pessimistic. Many economists believe industrialised countries need to grow by at least three pct a year if the world debt is to be brought under control. Eyskens added the Community wanted to give  certain nuances  to the IMF report that would be constructive for dealing with the Third World debt problem. However  Italian sources quoted Italian Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria as calling it scandalous that the meeting here did not include a discussion of what he called the problem of falling world demand. He complained that West Germany was refusing to do enough to boost demand while the United States  suffering from a massive trade deficit  was unable to do anything in this direction."

Economy Ministry sources said he hoped to seal an agreement rescheduling 30 bln dlrs of private foreign debt.

"2","West Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU)and their liberal Free Democrat Party (FDP) allies today won control of the central state of Hesse in state elections  toppling the Social Democrats (SPD) who had governed the state for over 40 years. The CDU/FDP coalition will have a two-seat majority over the SPD and their Greens party allies in the new state parliament. Earlier predictions forecast a hung parliament. The poll was the first major test of public opinion since national elections last January returned Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-dominated coalition to power in Bonn. Political commentators said the result was a debacle for the SPD  which has been split by disagreements over the party's future direction. It was also a rebuff for a unique coalition the SPD had formed in Hesse with the anti-nuclear Greens movement  which left-wing Social Democrats said could provide a model for a similar alliance at federal level. Bonn Environment Minister Walter Wallmann  the CDU's victorious candidate for the state premiership  told reporters  Many traditional SPD voters voted for us because they did not want an SPD that was under the influence of the Greens."
"2","Public opinion polls showing a surge insupport for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following her trip to Moscow have raised the possibility she will call a spring election  political analysts said. A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support for the ruling Conservative party  30 pct for the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party. Reproduced in a general election  the result would give Thatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22. A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives 41 pct support  12 percentage points ahead of both opposition groups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years. Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer a series of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote  securing it a clear parliamentary majority  before announcing the date for the next election. Lord Whitelaw  Conservative leader in the House of Lords and one of Thatcher's closest advisors  yesterday ruled out a May general election  but left open the choices of June and early autumn. The Sunday Times poll  taken during Thatcher's visit to Moscow last week  was the first to show the party breaking through 40 pct. The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip to Moscow  hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmed a number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance had overtaken Labour. Thatcher  currently serving her second consecutive term of office  does not have to call elections until June 1988 but is widely expected to do so within the next six months."
"2","U.S. Bond trading is likely to remaincautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar  the economy and Federal Reserve policy  economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains  that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady  perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer   the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates   said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate  the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market  highly sensitized to dollar movements  could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.  The crucial question  however  is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur   Kaufman said.  Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer   said Philip Braverman  chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However  Braverman said that   from a longer term perspective  current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.  Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data  key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year  in a similar  paroxysm of pessimism   the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance  however  Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear  which he considers unlikely. Held said that  since late 1986  Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally  that would mean a sharp bond price fall.  Yields could rise further over the next few months  but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen since the start of the year   Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.  The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance   said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said   The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.  Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy  foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift. However  economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday  with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index  a closely-watched economic indicator  rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct  translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987. Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told aparliamentary committee he expects major nations to reafffirm the currency pact they struck in Paris when they meet this week in Washington  political sources said. The Minister also was quoted as saying he expects major nations to take coordinated action to ensure exchange rate stability. Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate comment.

"2","U.S. Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige said the dispute between the U.S. And Japan over computer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war.  I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn't start a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive that there won't be a trade war with Japan   Baldrige said in a television interview. President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan's alleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stop selling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and to open its own market to U.S.-made chips. Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties  Baldrige said Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps that would lead to a trade war  largely because Japan itself would have the most to lose in such a conflict.  Japan  I think will -- because they have the means to do it -- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrial trading power in the world they have to live up to their responsibilities of free trade   he said.  I think we'll work our way out of this   he added.  It's not going to be easy. But I guarantee you  we're not going to have a trade war."
"2","An extension of the International TinAgreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed to lapse  Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told reporters. Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of the International Tin Council on April 8-9  Subroto said Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look into how to replace the pact. But he said that given the present disagreement between producers and consumers  there is unlikely to be any follow-up to the ITA. Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension of the ITA  he said   No one will propose that. It's also unrealistic to do so.  Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to introduce a quota system which limited their exports and consumption to 96 000 tonnes in the year starting March 1. Indonesia's quota was set at 24 516 tonnes."
"2","Indonesian Energy minister Subroto saidhe was very confident of continued stability in the oil market because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a price of 18 dlrs a barrel.  We are very confident that things will continue this way. The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution of Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price   he said at a signing ceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement. He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels  and he expected prices to firm slightly in the third quarter of the year. He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June  members will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and seeing prices rise a bit  or raising the production ceiling so that members could produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He gave no figures for how much he thought volume could be raised without undermining the 18 dlr target  or any indication of which option he preferred."
"2","The U.S. Administration  underCongressional pressure to cut the trade deficit  will urge Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington  monetary sources said. The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the 1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the Paris Accord are more binding  they said. Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect U.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast enough to curb their huge trade surpluses  they added. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the meeting  which will be attended by West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan  the sources said.  The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to announce a stimulative package the better it is for Japan and for the exchange markets in general   one of the sources said. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement  in which West Germany and Japan made their commitments  will be renewed by the industrial countries this week. Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made setting up stimulus measures. The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a further substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with Congress this year  the sources said. Washington would like its economic partners to establish specific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the set objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on appropriate corrective action  they added. The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports and the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit  thereby depressing its demand for imports. But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck  the sources said. Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods. One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings. Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures  aimed particularly at Japan  has strengthened  the sources said."

"2","The Bundesbank did not intervene asthe dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday  dealers said. Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning  with operators made wary by today's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington. It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar. Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels  made at the Paris meeting on February 22  a  vague statement   casting doubt on operators' assumptions that a secret target level had been set. Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged   there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar.  One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks.  They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative   he said. Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's undertone. Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators  dealers said. After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31  interest and activity was likely to switch  dealers said.  We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies   the U.S. Bank dealer said. Despite the softer undertone  traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings  dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later. The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct  unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender  signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy. Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy  he said  contradicting some growing sentiment. Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen's unabated strength  despite the intervention  brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480. The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060  Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100."
"2","Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita saidhe would support the issuance of Reagan bonds  yen-denominated U.S. Government securities  if it was considered appropriate  a Japanese daily paper reported. The Sankei Shimbun quoted Sumita as saying in an interview  It (Reagan bond) is a very feasible idea   speaking in the context of the effectiveness of such bonds in halting the dollar's decline. Asked how he would respond to the idea if it were brought up at any Group of Five meeting in Washington later this week  the paper quoted him as saying  I will back it up.  But Sumita said the market still has confidence in the dollar  and one must be careful in associating the current dollar decline with anything like a free fall  the paper said. In 1978  the administration of then president Jimmy Carter floated government securities worth four billion dlrs in marks and Swiss francs to try to halt the the dollar's depreciation. A Bank of Japan spokesman confirmed that the newspaper report was basically correct. But a senior central bank official told Reuters that as far as he knew  the idea was not being seriously considered now  either in the U.S. Or in Japan."
"2","President Reagan will shortlynominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World development  Peter McPherson  as second-ranking officer of the Department of the Treasury  administration sources said. They said the White House was expected to announce McPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy Treasury scretary later this week. The nomination is subject to Senate approval. McPherson has headed the Agency for International Development (AID) since 1981. As Treasury Secretary James Baker's chief assistant  he would be expected to work closely on international economic policy  including the major problems of the Mexican and Brazilian debts. McPherson  a lawyer  worked in the White House under President Gerald Ford  after serving as a corporate tax specialist for the Internal Revenue Service. He also spent two years in Peru as a member of the Peace Corps. Darman  who was considered to have played a central role in achieving agreements among industrial countries on international economic policy  will leave the Treasury on April 13 to join the Investment Banking Group of Shearson Lehman Brothers."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerholds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today  to urge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed their economic growth. Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making agreements to coordinate economic policies more binding. The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of the Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy and Canada to form the Group of Seven. The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of the United States  Japan  West Germany  France and Britain. The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to reaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic growth  reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies. Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is expected after the meeting ends. These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the same time  monetary sources say they expect Baker to put forward proposals  originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo Summit  to tighten procedures for policy coordination. Washington wants other major nations to establish specific policy goals for economic growth  inflation  current account balance of payments  trade balances  budget performance  monetary conditions and currencies. If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such objectives  then countries should consult on whether corrective action is necessary  the proposal says. Monetary sources said there was some support for the proposal  which may not be made final until the Venice Economic Summit in June  but Britain and West Germany were firmly against any attempt to make corrective action automatic. The U.S. Treasury team  led by Baker  has worked on this plan since last September  when it won the support of France. Baker  meanwhile  will press Japan and West Germany to live up to their commitments  made over six weeks ago in Paris  to boost their domestic demand to absorb more imports. He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the Reagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a significant budget deficit cut this year  helping to depress U.S. demand for imports. The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge imbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the one hand  and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other. Japan  in particular  is under pressure to come up with a meaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen. Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go higher against the dollar  a development that has become unacceptable in Japan. The Paris Agreement  by the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain and Canada  called for currencies to be stabilized around current levels. But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the agreement was reached  and its present stability is said to be temporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks. Meanwhile  representatives of the leading Third World countries continue preparing their position for their ministers to present to industrial nations later this week. Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing nations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the western strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure. They call instead for vast new assistance from the industrial world and a much greater role for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
"2","Shifts in domestic economic policy not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions  are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments  Dutch Finance Miniister H. Onno Ruding said. Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.  The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar  is not still more protectionism in your country.   No  it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies   Ruding said. Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates. He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States  especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings. But he said other countries  such as Japan and West Germany  also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee  Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing.  In that kind of situation  further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive   he said. Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports  Volcker said. On the value of the dollar  Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade.  What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made   he said.  That adjustment should be large enough  in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States  to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead   he said. Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow. Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure  the United States would have to slow its spending growth. It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital.  The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit  year by year  paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts   he said. Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation  he said."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth  but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing.  There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way   Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee. The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them  he said. Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power  but it is in a difficult position today  Volcker said. He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize Brazil's external payments.  The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian authorities   he said. Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together  Volcker said. Regarding trade imbalances  Volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations. In addition  the United States must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies  Volcker said.  We need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects   he said."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said international policymakers should make improving the stability of exchange rates a major priority. In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee  Volcker said he does not have any specific proposals for improving exchange rate stability  but thought it was worthy goal.  I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward greater exchange rate stability   Volcker said.  I think that the objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom larger among our various policy priorities."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said the performance of the dollar in exchange markets could be a factor in the U.S. central bank's decisions on monetary policy.  The performance of the dollar in the exchange market might become a factor bearing on our provision of reserves   Volcker said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. He said that fiscal policy changes in the United States  Germany and Japan would be more important that intervention to instill confidence in current exchange rate levels."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said reducing the federal budget deficit was a more important goal for Congress than drafting trade legislation.  Reduce the budget deficit   Volcker responded when asked by a member of the Senate Banking Committee about trade legislation priorities.  If you don't deal with the budget deficit  everything else you do is going to be counterproductive   he said."
"2","As pressure mounted on British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher to call a June election  she said today that the decision on when to go to the county was hers and hers alone. She was speaking to parliament after senior members of the ruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due in June 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion polls giving her party a commanding lead. Asked by a Conservative back-bencher for an assurance that the decision was hers alone  and did not depend on  media hype  pressure and speculation   she replied:  The date of the next election will be decided by Downing Street  not Fleet Street.  Downing Street is the Prime Minister's official residence  Fleet Street the traditional home of the British national press. A Harris poll for the breakfast-time program TV-AM gave the Tories 43 pct of the vote  representing a majority of 132 seats in parliament  their biggest lead since the party's landslide victory in the 1983 elections. In The Times of London  a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92 seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling party with a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and the fast-improving centrist Alliance. Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls in June  Sir Marcus Fox  vice-chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Conservative back-benchers  said:  I have always felt that it would be June  and this reinforces my view.  I always thought June was right. We have got most of our legislation through and to go beyond that I do not think would be in the national interest.  Another Tory back-bencher  Anthony Beaumont-Dark  said:  I have always been an October man  but I think it would be good to get it out of the way now.  Their comments came as government officials dismissed speculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls in May  timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent popularity surge  Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow and Labour's current popularity slump. Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concern over a steady advance by the Alliance  and the possibility that if it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overall majority in parliament. Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight points over the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the outcome of the next election is likely to be decided."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending.  A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. You don't want to put interest rates up unless you have to   Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.  That is not a constructive way to proceed   he said. Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the budget deficit or squeezing investment  he would favor squeezing the budget deficit. In response to a question about banks  Volcker said he would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves against loans to debtor countries.  If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans  then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy   Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc)."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said that he did not believe there was a connection between the Fed's policies and the recent rise in the prime interest rate by most major U.S. banks.

"2","U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter said that if Congress were to require trade retaliation  it would only close markets and would result in less trade. In remarks prepared for an address to members of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business  Yeutter said many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly protectionist  yet their undeniable effect would be to close off market opportunitites  just as exchange rate movement is unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several years.  Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite the President's comprehensive competitiveness initiative  there are many in Congress who still are supporting trade bills containing many dangerous provisions   Yuetter said. Yeutter said many countries would prefer U.S. retaliation to opening their own markets.  We should be intelligent enough to not let them off the hook that easily   he said. He said that tough but flexible legislative language is infinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language. Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirable limits on Presidential discretion  he said.  Limiting the President's ability to consider all available options on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise   Yeutter said.  That could readily provoke retaliation  which would unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars  injuring most competitive export industries.  Yeutter said present U.S. trade laws are fundamentally sound. President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliation eight times in the last 18 months -- most recently in the case of Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets.  He took these steps as a last resort  only after carefully analyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis and only after determining that such actions would open markets to American exports   he said. Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve the U.S. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. He added that the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomic policy shortcomings here and abroad."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said President Reagan should have the authority and responsibility for deciding if and when to award import relief.

Yeutter was commenting on proposed changes in the law which would transfer to the trade representative much of the current retaliatory power held by the White House  which has been the target of congressional dissatisfaction on trade issues."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said a textile bill  widely expected to be offered as an amendment to trade legislation on the House or Senate floor  is  pure protectionism.

President Reagan vetoed that bill last year and would almost certainly reject this year's bill  he added.  We simply cannot accept legislation that would provoke retaliation against American exporters  destroy the Uruguay Round  and embroil us in dozens of trade wars   the trade representative said."
"2","Brazil's financial crisis is rapidlybecoming a political and social crisis  and President Jose Sarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future. As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the United States this week  political analysts say Sarney's administration has never appeared weaker. The full political price which Sarney will have to pay for the failure of the much-vaunted anti-inflation Cruzado Plan is still not clear. He might have to pay with the presidency. Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to pick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of his term will be decided by a Constituent Assembly  and Sarney has been lobbying for a six-year term. Sarney came to power  without facing presidential elections  in March 1985  when the military bowed out after 21 years of rule. Although there was wide public support for direct elections for president  the military as one of their last acts  insisted an electoral college  where it felt it had more influence  make the choice. The college chose Tancredo Neves  a popular politician who headed the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB)  which had opposed military rule. In part to smooth relations with the military  Neves chose Sarney  a supporter of the generals  for the purely ceremonial post of vice-president. But Neves died before he could take office and Sarney took power. He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado Plan was wildly popular with inflation-weary Brazilians. But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not been the same.  The country is a rudderless ship   said a U.S. Diplomat  echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea of how to tackle the economic crisis. Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated  with criticism coming from the business community  the trade unions  some of the military  the media and political opponents. Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney's decision announced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt. A motor industry executive said:  The business community thinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimes harsh and strict  but this is the only way to put the house in order.  Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium  but disagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the end of February they have organized national strikes of seamen  bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local stoppages and protests. Economic problems have prompted criticism from some military figures  including the last army ruler  General Joao Figueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost daily military men deny there is going to be a coup. If the army does stay in the barracks  the key arbitors of Sarney's fate will be the PMDB's leaders. So far  they have not taken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections. But one PMDB leader  Senator Affonso Camargo  pointedly said yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the Consituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency whenever it wished. In the media  Sarney has to contend with strong criticism. One senior political commentator  Fernando Pedreira of the Jornal do Brasil  wrote in the newspaper last week:  President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions  but it is just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state of the country and the people since the immense failure of the Cruzado Plan.  The disappointment  the frustration  the irritation  the enticement have been (and continue to be) too great  too profound. He called for direct elections early in 1988 as the only way out of the present crisis. One of Sao Paulo's leading news magazines  Senhor  said in an editorial this week:  The anarcho-populist government of President Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already been too long for such a disastrous experience.  It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. The natural solution: direct elections soon.  The government's inability to control inflation is now bringing with it serious social problems. An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens of thousands of families onto the streets because they can no longer afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums. The local press says the city is experiencing the biggest wave of land invasions in its history. According to rental agencies  rents have increased 500 pct in little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost 2 000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month  half as much again as the minimum wage  which is all that many earn. Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns  the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sao Paulo  warned yesterday of the possibility of  a social conflict of unimaginable proportions.  With his back to the wall politically and with social tensions rising  Sarney is no position to compromise on debt."

Near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course for America   said Sen. Bennett Johnston in a statement issued with the report.  It would force us to break the bank  throw out the ABM treaty and commit us to an arms race in space.  The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debate over the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)  as the land and space-based anti-missile system is called  and may decide later this month to reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to include development and space testing. Johnston  of Louisiana  and fellow Democrat William Proxmire of Wisconsin  whose staff prepared the report  accused the administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as a political ploy to commit the United States to strategic defenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.  This report exposes the fact that without a presidential directive or congressional consent  the SDI program ... is being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic defenses   Proxmire  chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee  said.  In other words  they're covertly reorienting the SDI program without congressional approval."

However  the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified  would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord  which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February  to be strengthened. Currency target zones  or reference ranges  will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow  the Japanese officials said. The meeting  which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions  will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord  the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates  officials said  but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan  which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency  but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus  Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7  the officials said. However  Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet  or parliament  despite the new fiscal year which started April one  the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5 000 billion yen in additional spending."
"2","Dutch Finance Minister Onno Rudingsaid there was a growing feeling in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that commercial banks and debtor countries should take a greater lead in assembling new financing packages.  The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put together large packages like Mexico   Ruding told reporters in a briefing on this week's semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks. Ruding  who is also chairman of the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee  said he was reflecting a feeling within the two institutions. Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling the institutions were being unduly pressured by the Reagan administration  Ruding replied  we should not go in the direction of politicisation of the two institutions.  Ruding said  no country large or small should push in that direction.   He said he expected commercial bank lending to debtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace of lending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any major initiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in the debt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debt crisis itself. In other remarks  Ruding said many countries supported a General Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expected Bank president Barber Conable also to express his support. The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present. Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would support the use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance but would stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automatic consultations if indicators were sharply out of line with policy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggested establishing  norms  or automatic triggers for consultations among industrial states if policies deviate from plan. Currently the plan also has the support of France  the Netherlands and Italy while Britain  Japan and West Germany are all opposed."
"2","Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here  Poehl said  It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.  He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation  inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy  accelerating tax cuts  cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year  but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark  he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product  so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.  A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth   he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors  including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade  had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct  not the reported negative inflation rates last year  and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.  For the time being  we will have to focus our policy more on the external side  and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful   he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses  which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries  saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level  and that further changes would damage growth  he said.  This was a remarkable change in attitude  especially on the part of our American colleagues   he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot."
"2","Yugoslav government plans to stopsubsidising loss-making firms will anger hundreds of thousands of workers  Western diplomats said. The law  proposed by Prime Minister Branko Mikulic  goes into effect on July 1 and aims to end a long-standing practice of supporting unprofitable companies. Under the law  wage cuts will be imposed on losing enterprises  while those failing to recover within a six-month grace period will face liquidation. The diplomats said Mikulic's attempt to create a market economy is inevitable  but has still come as a shock to those accustomed to government subsidies.  It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed  but if an overdose is taken too abruptly  it may have adverse effects on the system   a Western diplomat said. He said if the law was applied too strictly it would probably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest. Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following the introduction of a wage-freeze law  later amended to allow more flexibility and some exemptions in what some political analysts saw as a retreat by Mikulic. But with inflation moving towards 100 pct  trade union leaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take. The union leaders said workers thoughout the country are already receiving salaries below limits set under existing law  while others have received no wages at all this year because their employers are unable to pay them. Workers also complain much of their income is taken in local  state and federal taxes. Many others are losing their motivation to work and confidence in government as they feel their decision-making powers are being eroded  trade union officials said. Meanwhile  the official Tanjug news agency reported a paper and cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republic closed yesterday and 2 000 of its workers were given  temporary leave.  Tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24 years it had been in operation  and its closure was the result of  economic necessity  rather than bankruptcy."
"2","The French government won  as expected  avote of parliamentary confidence sought by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac on his general policies.

"2","Mines and Energy Minister Subrotoconfirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA)  but said a new pact was not necessary. Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse  Subroto said Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.  We can support extension of the sixth agreement   he said.  But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary.  The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension."
"2","Japan's Agriculture Ministry  angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market  will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan  a senior ministry official said.  Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers   the official  who declined to be named  said.  Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market   he said. Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market  where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers. Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S.  He said. End-users would also buy other origins  grain traders said. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng  who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27  has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports. Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia  the largest beef supplier to Japan  has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31. Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America  while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year  although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier. U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports  since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports  mainly from the U.S.  Japanese officials said. An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports  with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business. The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products  including fruit juices  purees and pulp  tomato juice  ketchup and sauce  peanuts  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans. To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S.  Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products. But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction  and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.  Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products  and these issues should not be discussed on the same table   the official said."
"2","Australian markets are booming as foreignfund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets  analysts said. High short-term interest rates  a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months  largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors  analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia  Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments  they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month  record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available  but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States.  These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability   National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said.  There is a 'flight to quality'   Hamley said.  Australia may not be in the best (economic) position  but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money.  The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit  analysts said.  We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar   Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said.  Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?  But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy  he said.  It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy   Buttrose said  adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere  fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese  who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates  analysts said.  It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered  if the statement wasn't considered tough enough  one might see a substantial outflow   Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit  analysts said.  They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here   Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their  eyes off the yen  because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar  the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets  but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities  particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1 758.3 today  nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986  while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3 081.0 in the same period. The property sector is also sought after  with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate  particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought.  They think they find good value real estate here which  with long term and fixed capital investment  is the kind of investment Australia needs   Buttrose added."

"2","West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement  also known as the Louvre accord  had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago  at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank  marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners.  There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord   he said.  We will be looking at ways of strengthening it  but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a  slight firming  of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar.  The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market   he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said  however  that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation.  And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress   he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar  noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.  You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem  it is a European problem   he said."
"2","Canada will increase corporate taxrevenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years by broadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions  finance minister Michael Wilson said. As Wilson previously promised  he said corporations will bear an increased tax burden  despite new measures to lower overall tax rates. Increased corporate revenues will result from broadening the tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.  The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate income tax system that is competitive with other countries  particularly the United States   Wilson said in a prepared speech to the House of Commons.  And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitable corporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden   he added. Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470 mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31  1988  410 mln dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990  according to documents tabled with Wilson's speech."
"2","The average tax rate for Canadianfinancial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pct under the new tax reform package  the federal finance department said. The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxed will also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct  it said in documents tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson's prepared speech to the House of Commons. Under Wilson's plan  the federal government will collect 1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financial insitutions  including banks  trust mortgage and life insurance companies  according to finance department documents. Financial institutions  are going to complain  but we believe the changes are appropriate and affordable   said one finance department official who asked not to be identified. Ottawa will collect more revenue from financial institutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deduct from taxes  which  will broaden the tax base for this low tax paying sector   the finance department said. Among the changes  chartered banks will no longer be able to use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan losses that may be deducted for tax purposes. Effective June 17  1987  banks will deduct bad or doubtful loans during the year they are incurred. The finance department said the impact of the new provisions will be cushioned over a period of five years. The changes are needed to ensure that all financial companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial services industry.  It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continue to provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutions competing in the same marketplace   the finance department said."
"2","Canada will broaden a federal sales taxlevied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor of a broad based  multi-staged sales tax  finance minister Michael Wilson said. As expected  Wilson did not include a new sales tax system as part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House of Commons today. Instead  the federal government will make interim changes to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and middle income Canadians.  The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed. It is a hidden  arbitrary and capricious tax   Wilson told the House of Commons. The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that makes them less competitive  Wilson said. Interim changes effective January 1  1988 will include: -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies related to manufacturers -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the manufacturer for a selected range of products -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication services  except for residential telephone lines -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes. To offset these changes for low income Canadians  refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50 dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children  the finance department said. Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new sales tax  including a goods and services tax  a value added tax and a national sales tax that would combine existing federal and provincial levies into one system  Wilson told the House of Commons. He said the federal government will explore the possibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10 provincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a provincial sales of tax of varying amounts. Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for taxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform. If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national sales tax system  Wilson said the federal government will consider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax. A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to virtually all goods and services in Canada and would include further increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle income Canadians  the finance department said in documents accompanying Wilson's speech. A federal value-added tax  similar to European tax systems  would also be broad based but would allow more flexibility to exempt selected goods and services  the department said. The finance deparment said the main drawback of a value added tax is that it would be more complex and costly to implement than the other two proposals."
"2","Finance Minister Michael Wilson said taxreform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures  but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.  Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible   Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons. Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31  1988  the same level as he forecast in the February budget. And in the year ended this past March  the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast  Wilson said. Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending  particularly in farm income support programs  will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues. But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system. The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991. Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy  forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct. Inflation  meanwhile  is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years."
"2","Finance Minister Michael Wilson tabled aways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on preferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of corporate tax revenue. Under the motion  which is used to introduce most financial tax changes  dividends on all preferred shares issued after June 18 will be taxable. The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two forms of tax  one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a subsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder  and one that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.  Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax financing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical step in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to fund personal income tax reductions   Wilson explained. The minister said many profitable corporations  using various deductions built up over the years  pay no taxes  although they are in a position to pay dividends out of their profits."
"2","Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveileda wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includes limiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in the dividend tax credit. With most changes effective at the first of next year  Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax brackets from 10 to three. He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by two billion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over the next five years.  Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of two far-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income tax rates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to tax credits   Wilson told the House of Commons. The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27 500 dlrs of taxable income  26 pct on the next 27 500 dlrs and 29 pct on taxable income in excess of 55 000 dlrs. The maximum tax rate is 34 pct under the current system. In a major reversal of his own initiative  Wilson said the controversial 500 000 dlrs capital gains exemption will be reduced to 100 000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime. Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking office in 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment  but it was sharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous to wealthy investors. The 500 000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on the sale of farm land and for small businesess  however. Also  the taxable portion of a capital gain will increase from 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990. The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to 25 pct and the deduction for up to 1 000 dlrs of interest and dividend income will be eliminated in 1988. Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savings plan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of the increase in the maximum limit to 15 500 dlrs will be delayed four years to 1994."

"2","The conservative opposition  alreadyfighting an uphill election battle  now faces controversy in its own ranks over a possible error in its major tax cutting program  economists said. Professor Michael Porter  architect of the tax plan  declined to refute Treasurer Paul Keating's charge that the opposition miscalculated tax and expenditure cuts by several billion dollars. Economists said the opposition  trailing behind Labour in opinion polls  would find its chances further diminished if its tax policy was a miscalculation. The tax plan  unveiled by opposition leader John Howard last week  is the cornerstone of the Liberal Party's economic strategy to oust the Labour Party in the July 11 poll. Keating has said the Howard tax plan would sharply increase the budget deficit to more than nine billion dlrs and severely damage Australia's economy  already overburdened with balance of payments and foreign debt problems. In his mini-budget on May 13  Keating said the budget deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and three billion dlrs. Porter  a key member of the opposition economic think tank  said he played a leading role in formulating the tax plan but not Howard's proposed expenditure savings  which Keating claimed were distorted through double counting. Some opposition members said there appeared to be errors  but a Liberal Party spokesman refused comment  saying the package was being reexamined.  The whole thing is so deceitful   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said in a radio interview.  Howard has made a mess of it. If they can't govern themselves  how can they expect to govern the country?  Hawke  who is seeking a third term  said the opposition had made the election one of the easiest for him.  I've never felt more physically and mentally relaxed (during an election). We've no problems at all   he said. The latest public opinion poll  published in the Melbourne Sun newspaper  showed Labour was leading the opposition by 12 points  indicating a 66-seat majority for Hawke in parliament. The Election Commission announced last night that 613 candidates would contest the 148-seat House of Representatives  while 255 candidates would fight for the 76 Senate seats."

He said Reagan would not accept the 19 bln dlr tax increase in Congress' proposal but said  keep in mind the president has proposed certain revenues in his budget.  They're not taxes   Miller said.  They are user charges and asset sales. I think there is some room there we can sit down and talk with the Democrats about.  Miller said he believed a compromise could be worked out but he said the administration would need assurance that whatever compromise it accepted would indeed by passed by Congress. Miller also said in the interview that he did not believe the new U.S. protection of 11 Kuwaiti tanker ships in the Persian Gulf would require a supplemental request to Congress later for more defense money."
"2","Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid current low unit wage costs are helping British exports but wage rises are  faster than is comfortable.  He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises were wrong  saying OECD predictions  are somewhat unreliable.   Productivity is rising very fast  and therefore even though wages are going up faster than is comfortable  the actual unit cost of labour...Is not going up fast at all   Lawson said in answer to questions on BBC radio.  That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in export markets  for example  but we could do even better and get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate rate of growth in wage increases   Lawson added. His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying average earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April  up from March's 7.5 pct increase  which sent the U.K. Government bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries. Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts for the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the economy. Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next budget due in March 1988.  We will certainly achieve it sooner or later   he said. The latest official data  released yesterday  showed unit wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pct annually in the three month period ended April  down from a 1.2 pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's first quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct. However  analysts said this figure is likely to deteriorate somewhat as productivity growth slows later this year."

"2","The West German government will stick toits agreed timetable and introduce tax cuts worth 44 billion marks from 1990  Chancellor Helmut Kohl said. Kohl told a news conference   The tax reform will be realised as agreed by the coalition after the (last general) election  in January. He said the leadership of his own Christian Democratic party repeated its support for the tax reform timetable at a meeting this week. CDU vice-chairman Lothar Spaeth also reiterated his doubts about whether the reform was feasible as planned  but received no support from other party members  he added. Kohl said the government intends to decide by the autumn how to raise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance the tax reform. Subsidies paid to ailing industries are the main target for trimming to pay for the tax reform. But politicians both inside and outside the government have expressed doubts about making politically painful cuts in subsidies."

He said the measure  would move us exactly in the wrong direction  towards high tariffs  trade barriers  trade distorting subsidies  slow growth and crimped world markets  and would destroy jobs."
"2","Bank of England governor RobinLeigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K. In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in Birmingham  he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable  relative to those on financial assets  than for a good number of years.  It would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively   he said.  We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity  but at the risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation   he added. Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry.  But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates  to 11 pct  was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time   he added. Base rate is currently nine pct."
"2","Dutch public authorities are on courseto meet the 1987 public sector deficit target of 7.9 pct of net national income (NNI) despite excess spending by the central government  according to a leaked official report. The so-called Spring Report  giving latest revenue and expenditure figures and to be discussed by the Dutch cabinet today  was leaked in advance to the Dutch press. The Dutch Finance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports. Newspapers quoted the report  drafted by Finance Minister Onno Ruding  as saying unexpected rises in revenue would compensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders. Ruding  putting this year's public sector borrowing requirement 0.1 percentage point below last September's target at 7.8 pct  criticised the excess spending but will not seek additional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boost in revenue  the report was quoted as saying. Excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8 billion guilders  while market factors accounted for another 300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure. But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion  including 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders in income from natural gas sales. Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the 1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet has already pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap. The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what further austerity measures will be needed next year to keep the government on target for its 1990 aim of a public sector borrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of NNI. Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal and Christian-Democrat factions carrying the government majority in parliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988 budget to counter a slow-down in economic growth."
"2","Finance Minister Mark Eyskens isproposing a package of personal income tax cuts worth 102.1 billion francs that would apply from 1989  a finance ministry spokesman said. The package  one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawn up by government officials  is expected to be discussed by ministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can be presented to parliament in October. The proposals  which would greatly simplify the country's tax system  include a cut in withholding tax on investment income earned in Belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct. The reduction would apply to income from risk capital  but the spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include all shares and bonds. The package chosen by Eyskens is more favourable to families with children than the present regime and would treat spouses' incomes separately instead of combining them  a practice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage. The tax reform does not encompass corporate taxation. The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package would be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances currently granted to diverse interest groups. A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues resulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the package. This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs  which the government would have to decide how to cover  either by raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts. The package favoured by Eyskens  who has described Belgium as a  fiscal Himalaya   is the least costly of the 11 scenarios prepared. It envisages three marginal rates  or tax thresholds  of 30 pct  40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently  of which the highest is 71.6 pct."
"2","After battling President Reagan allyear  Congress is about to pass a trillion dollar 1988 budget that sets the stage for even fiercer fighting over its tax and defence policies. But when the dust settles  congressional budget analysts say  Reagan and the Democratic opposition may finally sit down at a  budget summit  to call a truce and work out a deal over implementing the budget he opposes.  I think he essentially will (negotiate)   said a prominent House leader who did not want to be identified.  The ball is in his court ... We've done everything we could to make a summit.  The Democrat budget plan calls for $19 billion in new taxes next year  $64 billion over three years  and is set to be passed by the Democratic-led Congress next week. It would cut next year's deficit by about $37 billion to $134 billion. On Tuesday last week  Reagan said he would consider talks  except on defence or taxes  but three days later argued that Congress would first have to bend even further."
"2","The Administration asked Congress toreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites  items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago. Yeutter said the Harmonized System  as the new schedule is called  will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers  but they should pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said   American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face.  He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule. Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making. He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system  with about half expected to join the system by January 1988."
"2","Argentine President Raul Alfonsinmet for more than an hour with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus  and Argentine economy minister Juan Sourrouille said the two men discussed Argentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package. Sourrouille told reporters that 91.5 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan  which forms the core of the package  has been subscribed. Citibank  the chairman of Argentina's bank advisory committee  said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91 pct. The IMF has said that a  critical mass  of bank commitments is needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlr standby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina. Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass  Sourrouille said   That has not been defined but anywhere over 90 pct we are doing fine.  Although most of the money has been subscribed  officials noted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold 93 pct of its debt. They are worried that it might take a long time to persuade the other banks to join the deal. Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus  who had not met before  mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic situation. Alfonsin  who is beginning a four-day private visit to the U.S.  was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World Affairs Council  a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing public awareness of international affairs. In his speech  Alfonsin said economic integration is the only way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis.  This (economic integration) is probably the most audacious challenge facing Latin America this century  perhaps the most audacious of our history   he said."

Conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt crisis  which has prompted a number of U.S. Commercial banks to write off a portion of their Third World loans.  Our plans include initiatives on the debt front  as well as greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of private investment in Third World countries through our affiliate  the International Finance Corporation   Conable said.  The bank is primarily a development institution  not a debt-management agency. But debt must be managed effectively or it hampers development.  Conable defended his reorganisation plan for the bank  which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limiting bureaucracy. He added environmental considerations would play a larger role in the evaluation of proposed projects."
"2","The acting governor of Saudi Arabia'sstate-owned oil company  Petromin  Jamal Hassan Jawa  has retired at his own request  oil industry sources said. They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi  head of organisation planning in Petromin  would take over as acting governor. Jawa held the post since his predecessor  Abdul-Hadi Taher  left in a major oil industry shake up last December. The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently. The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market. The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources  Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut. Hisham Nazer  who replaced Yamani  successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December. Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business  the sources said. The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz  who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals  and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr  President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals  economist Ali Jonahi  Ahmed Shinawi  and Zuheir Masoud  director of Jeddah Islamic Port."

Camdessus said he wished his visit could have been in more pleasant circumstances in remarks reported by the official Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin. He added that the extremely steep fall in agricultural commodity markets had dealt a harsh blow this year to the Ivorian economy and because of this the country was experiencing a growth problem and difficulties with its international debt. Last month the Ivory Coast informed its creditors it had to suspend payments on its foreign debt  estimated at more than eight billion dlrs. Camdessus said his agency had to study the problems of the Ivory Coast but a solution depended on a coordinated effort between the country itself  the commercial banks  other governments and international finance institutions. He also disussed problems of developing countries in general with banking and government officials in Abidjan."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone'sdiminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax revenues in 1986/87  government officials said. Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to provide the revenue for more than 1 000 billion yen of tax cuts promised in the government's emergency economic package last month. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the 1986/87 tax take was as much as 2 500 billion yen more than expected. That means the government should have more than enough money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax measures proposed by Nakasone  one official said. The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising revenue to offset the tax cuts. But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of an indirect tax  at least for the time being. He still hopes to gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on small savings. The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed from increased receipts from land and securities taxes  as prices of both shares and land soared  one official said. But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than expected  perhaps indicating the recession of the last year induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought  he said. The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be released by the Finance Ministry on July 1. The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89 budget  several officials said. A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to stick with its so-called  minus-ceiling  policy  which calls for government departments to reduce investment spending by five pct a year. But he acknowledged this would be difficult  given the sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic and U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy."
"2","Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidWest Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a six-month lull. Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest rates could boost the domestic economy  Poehl said:  We would be badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.  This could  under certain circumstances  release new inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to higher interest rates   he added.  Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.  But since April  statistics clearly show that the economy finds itself on a course of growth   he said.  I expect this development to continue in the coming months.  Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community trade war  Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.  For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts   he added.  This includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S."
"2","Argentine Economy Minister JuanSourrouille left at the weekend for the United States for talks with creditor banks and the IMF aimed at obtaining the release of new loans  the semi-official news agency Telam said. It said Sourrouille would urge the IMF to release a 480 mln dlrs compensatory loan for falling exports as well as the first two tranches of a standby loan  totalling 450 mln dlrs. Release of the funds from the standby loan has been delayed by Argentina's failure to win final approval to a 1.95 billion dlr loan from creditor banks  which was a condition for the IMF disbursement. Banks have pledged 97 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan but the IMF has not yet defined what amount constitutes the  critical mass   which is needed for release of the IMF funds and the funds from creditor banks. The president of Argentina's bank steering committee  William Rhodes of Citibank  said on Friday he thought the loan agreement with Argentina could be signed in August."

"2","President Reagan is willingto compromise with Democrats in Congress on a plan to raise new federal revenues next year if they back his plan to reform the budget process  White House Budget Chief James Miller said.  If the Democrats want to insist that the president say whatever is agreed to is a tax increase  then they'd better just forget it because he's not going to do that   Miller said in an interview with Reuters.  But there are a lot of revenues other than those the president proposed (in his January budget plan)  I think  that we might look seriously at   he added. The Reagan budget  which has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress  envisages raising 22 billion dlrs in new revenues through the sale of a package of government assets and new fees on certain federal services. President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any tax increase voted by Congress for the 1988 financial year  arguing that cutting domestic spending was a better way to reduce the huge federal deficit. The deficit  which totaled 221 billion dlrs last year  is expected to decline to about 175 billion dlrs this year and would fall to about 140 billion dlrs next year under a budget blueprint recently approved by Congress. The one trillion dlr congressional budget plan contains about 19 billion dlr in additional revenues from new taxes in the government's budgetary year beginning October 1. The plan does not say how the additional revenues are to be raised  leaving it to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees to fill in the details later this year. Miller appeared to be signaling that the president might consider some sort of tax increase despite his frequently stated rejection of the concept. However  Miller declined to say which new revenue sources might be acceptable to the president.  I think it would be counterproductive for me to (set out options) which might suggest that we have one thing or another in mind   the White House budget chief said. He cautioned Congress about the political repercussions of certain moves  such as raising excise taxes on beer  cigarettes or telephone service  or raising corporate or personal income tax rates.  I think that those in Congress who think it will be a simple matter to go along with some increase in excise taxes are underestimating what they would be getting themselves into   he said.  What they don't really realize is that the political opposition they are going to feel to excise taxes is going to be a lot hotter tahn the political opposition to user fees  in certain ways  or asset sales   he continued.  But there are a lot of other things and revenue issues in government that probably ought to be addressed   he said. Before agreeing to a revenue package  the president would insist on reform of the budget process  Miller said.  The president is not going to take a sucker punch. He's not going to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when we can't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in fact will be delivered   he emphasized.  We'd like to have a budget process that gives us a contract  so that if the president agrees to something  he can depend on its coming through.  After returning to the United States from the economic summit in Venice earlier this month  President Reagan revived an earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform  calling for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the power -- called a  line-item veto  -- to block individual items in congressional spending bills. At the Venice summit  U.S. trading partners called on Washington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce global trade imbalances.  Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that U.S. trading partners  have to have faith and trust in the ability of the United tates to deal with its problems.  He said a deficit cut of about 40 to 45 billion dlrs a year  is about the optimal rate of reduction in the deficit. I don't think we can end the deficit overnight... I think we've got to have a gradual reduction over a period of several years.  Miller is in Beaver Creek attending the sixth annual World Forum  a gathering of current and former government officials and business representatives discussing world economic and political issues."

The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February.

The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community's worst-ever budget crisis.  The Germans clearly do not want to budge   an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting. Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex  green  currrency system  designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies. Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against  along with Britain  Denmark and the Netherlands. EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package  which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow. Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks. The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget. The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group  and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987."

It's just completely unacceptable   Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury  Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan  drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee  calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues  of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committee's budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy.  If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that we've had in the last five years at risk   Miller told the subcommittee.

Asked if he was satisfied with West German and Japanese stimulus  Wilson replied   They could do a little more.  French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur  meanwhile  confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the meeting. Finance ministers and central bankers of Britain  FRance  Canada and West Germany were seen by Reuter correspondents returning to a Treasury building. Japanese officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier Group of Five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time (1800 gmt). There was no sign  however  of the Italian delegation whose position was thrown into question this morning by the resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's Socialist-led government. European monetary officials said later that the Italian delegation was inside the building. This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven was in progress."
"2","President Reagan has agreed to letthe House and Senate select committees investigating the Iran arms sale review his personal diary notes on the affair  committee members said today. The notes will cover the period from January 1  1984 to December 19  1986 when the Iran arms deal was planned and carried out and will include notes on Iran  Nicaragua and related subjects  House committee chairman Lee Hamilton said. The notes will be selected by the White House counsel and reviewed by Reagan before they are made available to committee members within a few weeks. Under terms of the agreement  committee members will be allowed to review the notes at the White House  but will not be permitted to make copies of the information."
"2","Financial analysts say they arepleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy. The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly  the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year.  In terms of the economy  37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal  so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit   said Stanley Collander  a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.  At best  it will have a small positive effect   Collander said in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger. Such a decline  he has said  could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition  in February  U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement  Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit  Volcker said recently  is to reduce U.S. consumption  particularly federal spending.  If you don't deal with the budget deficit  everything else you do is going to be counterproductive   Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets.  There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps  but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy  then the answer is  it's not enough   Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past  Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget. On the other hand  he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit  both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.  For political reasons  35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get  out of Congress at the present time  said Touche Ross's Collander.  To do something more than that would be extraordinary  remarkable and very  very difficult.  Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.  To an extent  this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level   he explained.  Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street.  The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts."
"2","The Agriculture Ministry declined commenton a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.  We have no idea about the report and cannot comment   a spokesman told Reuters. Nihon Keizai Shinbun  quoting unnamed government sources  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks. The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum. Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act. Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks  Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified  it said. The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate."
"2","New Zealand's ruling Labour Partygovernment has just completed its three-year economic reform which threw thousands of people out of work  yet its popularity has risen as the September deadline for the election draws closer  a recent poll shows. An Eyewitness/Heylen Poll  conducted for Television New Zealand's Eyewitness news broadcast on April 2  showed Labour had the support of 50 pct of voters compared with the opposition National Party's 46 pct. The figures had been reversed in a poll a month earlier. The poll showed 40 pct of the canvassed voters thought the economy would improve over the next year  up 12 points on last month's result. The increase came in a week when the government turned seven departments into nine profit-oriented corporations run by businessmen who promptly sacked some 4 000 employees  including half the country's 1 700 coal miners. The latest survey confounded those who proclaimed Labour's days were numbered because of perceived insensitivity to its traditional backers  the workers  political analysts said. The poll indicates people are swinging behind the party and the arguments of Finance Minister Roger Douglas  who has presided over the deregulation of the economy and the construction of one based on market forces without subsidies or currency controls  the analysts said. The economic reforms  by a party increasingly regarded in New Zealand as more akin to the West European-style Social Democrats than working class socialists  have rattled the National Party  which is now regretting it was not as innovative in the decade it ruled until Prime Minister Robert Muldoon was ousted in 1983  one analyst said. The National Party was further shaken  the analyst said  when the Press  a Christchurch daily  said on April 2 the party was  on the verge of flying apart  with the prospect of a coup attempt against leader Jim Bolger by Muldoon. Bolger said the article was an April Fool's joke. Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong tax revenues  a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing  an improvement in the balance of payments  a reduction in foreign debt and improved productivity  economists said. Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter ended March 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year  they said. Labour's reforms have hit every sector  but the most dramatic was the  corporatisation  of seven government departments on April 1  which critics argue is the first stage step towards the sale of state assets  the analysts said. The move stops short of privatisation  as the state will retain ownership  but the new corporations are expected to be financially self-supporting and pay dividends. Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility  Electricorp  said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billion dlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them. No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the former forest service  the analysts added. Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service had been losing 100 mln dlrs annually  yet due to economies it now employed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the new corporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mln dlrs in its first year. Uncertainties have also arisen over the government  as the only shareholder  retaining the right to order the new corporations to undertake certain projects although the full cost must be met by the state  the analysts said. Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would be held accountable for performance  with the government paying for projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons. This policy has already caused problems  the analysts added. For example  Electricorp has refused to spend several hundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate  further up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under construction in Central Otago. Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs had decided last year that Luggate be built and it was important that the government honour its promises.  But it is also a matter of importance that we do not see many more jobs lost because of economic distortion than we would save by having that promise honoured to the last   he added."
"2","Members of prime minister YasuhiroNakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.  His presence will do more harm than good   an LDP candidate in Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of several conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax. Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10 if the LDP lost too many major local seats. Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his party to its greatest-ever election victory last July  and analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline. Over 2 500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of polling. The first round is on Sunday  the second on April 26. Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the governorship of Fukuoka  southern Japan. The LDP and two centre parties are challenging the incumbent governor  Hachiji Okuda  who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist parties. The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.  The LDP and the centrist parties should have about 1 350 000 votes against 700 000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the incumbent and has the sales tax weapon   said Rei Shiratori  professor of political science at Dokkyo University.  Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if the LDP wins in Fukuoka   he said. Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido. But Kenzo Uchida  professor of political science at Hosei University  said   Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if the LDP loses only in Hokkaido.  The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales tax proposal. The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system  which has remained unchanged for 36 years. It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese domestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating the economy."
"2","The Philippines will import 250 000 bagsof cement worth 375 000 dlrs from Indonesia by the end of the month to meet growing demand from the construction sector  Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion said. He told reporters that local cement manufacturers had stepped up production but were falling short of demand.  The only solution is to import   he added. Concepcion said average monthly requirements of cement in 1986 were 6.7 mln bags while supply hovered around 9.3 mln bags  but this year demand had grown to 10.4 mln bags per month. Trade and Industry sources said construction sector representatives estimated an additional 70 000 bags would be required daily to meet demand. Cement is officially priced at 48.50 pesos per bag  but construction industry sources said it was selling at black market rates of up to 65 pesos a bag in some areas. The sources said falling interest rates as well as a government budget of four billion pesos in 1987 for low-cost housing had fuelled a construction boom."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar that has occurred since the Paris Agreement was within the range agreed on in the Louvre discussions.  I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris   Miyazawa told a press conference following the Group of Seven meeting here. He added that the current discussions were a  reaffirmation  of that agreement  indicating that the  solidarity  that occurred in Paris was still in place."
"2","Finance ministers from seven majorindustrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night  the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now  and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a  good meeting  and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo  the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said   The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed  however  that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures  sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.  It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed  extraordinary and urgent measures  including an  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.  The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies  the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed  the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials  reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve. At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting  Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals  and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed  he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen  while other currencies  especially the mark  had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.  As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement)  the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea   he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury  he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level  which could have an adverse impact on the market  Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement  he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago."
"2","The yen is likely to start anotheruneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new  currency and bond analysts here said.  Is that it? I was expecting something more than that   said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company. Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said:  The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again.  The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington. After more than four hours of talks  the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels. The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.  They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?   asked Republic's Cohen. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February. Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities' permissible range. Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments. Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen. The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs  from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.     &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"
"2","The United States  which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy  appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies. Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package  announced yesterday  to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy. But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar  the level at the February 22 Paris Accord  to about 145 today. The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington  to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations. In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action  extraordinary and urgent   the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals  or economic reality. The Group of Seven -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability. The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful  the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement. They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings. West Germany  whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement  appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable. Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place. No mention was made  however  of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris. European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year. A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would  clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability   he said. Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates. Monetary sources said that  privately  West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit. Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States  the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets. The ministers  meanwhile  also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one  Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson  said good progress was made. Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations. The United States and France  backed by the International Monetary Fund  want the seven to agree on ranges or  norms  for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth  inflation  monetary conditions  trade balances and current account balances. Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required. But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried  monetary sources say  because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones. The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting. The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years."

"2","West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said he was not surprised by the overnight decline of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Speaking briefly with reporters before entering a meeting of the International Monetary Fund he said   These minor movements don't really affect us.  The dollar declined in the initial reaction to a statement by the Group of Seven industrial countries reaffirming their Paris agreement in February to maintain their currencies around current levels."
"2","Nigel Lawson  Britain's Chancellor ofthe Exchequer  said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability. Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago  he said central banks would continue to intervene  as and when necessary.  He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States  Japan and West Germany  though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament.  If anything I'm a little bit less concerned  but there is still a risk   he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar  he said   If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates  it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States.  Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit.  We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year   Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord  he said   I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.  Although intervention could be a cause of inflation  Lawson said   the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant.  He said yesterday's G-7 statement  which affirmed that  current levels  of exchange rates were appropriate  had been  carefully worded.   We know what we mean  and we all mean the same thing   he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore  the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending  but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year."
"2","British Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson said he saw no immediate implications for British monetary policy arising from the Group of Seven meeting yesterday.  Exchange rate stability is in the U.K.'s interest   he told journalists. Asked what it meant for U.K. monetary policy  he said   No  I do not think there are any immediate implications."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee  Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have  now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.  Baker said   These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly  and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels.  As they are today  the trade and current account imbalances  simply are not sustainable   Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was resisting  strong domestic pressure  for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.  While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome  we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist   he said. Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall.  We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary   he said."

Democratic leaders said they expected to pass the committee's budget after considering two other alternatives  but committee sources said the voting could be close."
"2","Council of Economic Advisers chairmanBeryl Sprinkel said the Reagan Administration remains strongly opposed to a tax increase  including 18 billion dlrs of new revenues in the budget plan by Congressional Democrats.  We believe that significant increases in taxes would not reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth   Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee. He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of gradually reducing deficits through restraining government spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit."

He told reporters that  our ideas are progressing   adding that the finance ministers have been talking about more cooperation on economic policies and on levels around which currencies should stabilize."
"2","The United States will push for astrong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June economic summit in Venice  urging  comprehensive  negotiations on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm subsidies  the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.  Agriculture has really become the number one international economic problem   Allen Wallis  undersecretary of state for economic affairs  told Reuters in an interview. At the Tokyo economic summit last year  western leaders identified agriculture as a major international problem but made no specific recommendations. This year  Wallis said the U.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to begin negotiating on the issue  and include domestic programs. While the Western leaders  including president Reagan  will not conduct specific negotiations  Wallis said they can give a push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Wallis said the leaders should endorse a  comprehensive  negotiation  which is interpreted as including domestic policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.  They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic policies  as well as trade arrangements   Wallis said. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit statement of support for agriculture talks is part of an overall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm talks. Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the Reagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue. Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will repeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting next week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda of the trade ministers  quadrilateral  talks among Japan  the European Community  the U.S. and Canada this month. And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  in May will highlight the agriculture problem  Yeutter said. The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic farm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies among industrial countries  but aid to farmers is also generous in the EC and United States. The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm subsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent  PSE  which allows farm aid to be compared across countries. Some officials including British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling  have said the PSE could be useful as a method of negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide. However  the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE can be useful in negotiations  it has shortcomings and  its not definitive.  He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration has not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture proposal to present to the GATT.  I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall   after the series of international meetings  Wallis said. At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee  the United States has pushed for the so-called  freeze and rollback  approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current levels  then rolled-back jointly in stages. However  the Reagan administration perplexed some trade analysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian prime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke unveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce the gap between high farm price supports and world prices. Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13 coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.  The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming up with seem to be focusing on short-run  quick fixes which is not what we think is what's called for here   Wallis said. Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a  long-range  solution to the agriculture problem. U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal because they said it deals primarily with the difference between domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.  but fails to focus on the question of market access. At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian  quick fix   Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for a declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed  expeditiously   or within two years. The unstated U.S. strategy  U.S. officials said  is to keep the pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement program and lower value of the dollar  in the hope that a sweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988."

"2","Brazil's political crisis appearsto be deepening as powerful state governors are calling for the removal of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro  chief architect of economic policy. Commentators said their call  front-page headlines in today's press  laid bare President Jose Sarney's political weakness and highlighted Brazil's economic planning turmoil. The demand for Funaro's resignation came last night from four governors with much combined political clout  those of Sao Paulo  Rio de Janeiro  Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. At a news conference in Sao Paulo  they delivered a blunt message -- the economy was in crisis and they wanted a new ministerial team to shape policy. Otherwise there was a risk of social chaos."
"2","Members of prime minister YasuhiroNakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.  His presence will do more harm than good   an LDP candidate in Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of several conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax. Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10 if the LDP lost too many major local seats. Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his party to its greatest-ever election victory last July  and analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline. Over 2 500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of polling. The first round is on Sunday  the second on April 26. Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the governorship of Fukuoka  southern Japan. The LDP and two centre parties are challenging the incumbent governor  Hachiji Okuda  who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist parties. The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.  The LDP and the centrist parties should have about 1 350 000 votes against 700 000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the incumbent and has the sales tax weapon   said Rei Shiratori  professor of political science at Dokkyo University.  Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if the LDP wins in Fukuoka   he said. Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido. But Kenzo Uchida  professor of political science at Hosei University  said   Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if the LDP loses only in Hokkaido.  The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales tax proposal. The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system  which has remained unchanged for 36 years. It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese domestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating the economy."

"2","Brazilian Finance Minister DilsonFunaro shrugged off demands by a group of Brazilian governors that he resign.  At this moment I am discussing something much more serious for Brazil and it's absolutely indispensible in a negotiation like this one that I dedicate myself entirely to the discussions   Funaro told reporters. Funaro  who spoke today to the International Monetary Fund's interim committee  was referring to talks he began Tuesday with creditor banks in New York in which unveiled Brazil's economic targets and financial needs. The governor of Sao Paulo state Orestes Quersia and other governors last night called on Brazilian President Jose Sarney to assume direct control of the debt negotiations. Asked if the governors' demands for his resignation would affect negotiations  Funaro said:  We are building a new refinancing position and that is what we are doing now. The rest is secondary.  He added that Brazil's economic program clearly demonstrates the intention to renegotiate the countries international financial committments  and added:  The domestic problems are our business.  Funaro said discussions on Brazil's refinancing proposals were well under way with private creditor banks and added World Bank President Barber Conable had also accepted the proposals as  a good plan  at a meeting they had last night. But Conable  who was also present at today's IMF interim committee meeting told reporters that the World Bank wanted further clarifications on Brazil's economic programs.

He said Japan intended to carry out policies announced at the Paris meeting of finance ministers to stimulate its economy.

In addition   we are most concerned about this very serious problem of exchange rate instability   Miyazawa said."
"2","Argentina's Economy Minister JuanSourrouille said the  narrow interest  of creditor banks was holding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warned Argentina may break off negotiations.  It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of some banks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for a policy we have agreed with the international community   Sourrouille said. Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee meeting  Sourrouille said Argentina had given ample proof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.  Today  with that same responsibility  we are clearly stating that it will be imposible for us to continue negotiating on that basis.  A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from a vantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  said Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the names of banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.  Let's give them a call right away   the source quoted Baker as saying. Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMF last February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and a longer-term credit  known as an extended Fund Facility for another 500 000 dlrs. But he said that despite Argentina's  disciplined effort  to achieve inflation-free economic growth  it was unable to obtain IMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement and settlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks. Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting a long-established practice under which debtor countries which reached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were a good credit risk for the banks.  In other words  facts are demonstrating that the current debt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weak signal for the beginning of another discussion (with the banks)   he stated. He added the fact that the strategy is not working was also demonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's program had to join in a bridge loan for his country. Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirements regarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscal policies. Despite this Sourrouille said   What we are facing is the inexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blocking negotations.  Argentina  with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs  has been seeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in  old debt  and another 4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985. The minister also said there were two issues separating Argentina from an accord with creditor banks  one was a minimum difference on the interest rate margin above international levels. The other condition  of more concern  were suggestions by the banks that would upset the country's financial system. Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offering Argentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct  which they gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement. The sources said Argentina is committed to winning the lower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee  Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.  But I do suggest   he said   that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts.  He said that indicators can serve  as a kind of compass  but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker  however  said the IMF  needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.  The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public.  In particular  we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations  the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations  and greater use of special consultation procedures   he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device  for moving beyond rhetoric to action.  He said they provide  more structure to the system  and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.  He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.  This should be matter of priority for the executive board   he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that  can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances  by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.  He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.  If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course  then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables   he said."

"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat commercial banks need to develop more flexibility in their concerted lending mechanisms  to help assure continued participation in new money packages.  He said that major debtor nations need to be able to count on receiving timely disbursements on new loans essential to support well-conceived economic programs. His remarks were made to the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee. Baker said   The sense of urgency and willingness to cooperate in support of a larger general interest that helped to carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and 1983 is now less evident.  He said to address this problem  it is important for the commercial banks to  develop a menu of alternative new money options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose in providing continuing support for debtor reforms.  He said the  continued implementation of the debt strategy may well rest on their doing so.  Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest income countries remain an issue of  critical concern to the United States.  He said that he intended to address the problem of poor country prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting of the joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee. Baker said  however  that ministers should guard against what appear to be magical solutions to the complex debt problem.  I want to stress the need for all to guard against the ephemeral attraction of magical solutions  which may appear as tantalizing alternatives to the rigorous realities of grappling with our debt problems   he said. But he emphasized that the only lasting progress is to approach each situation on a case-by-case basis   bringing to bear the policies and financing needed to bring the economy back to sustained economic growth."
"2","Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financialmarkets  with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's wake  is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead  economists said. For two years  the markets had hailed the dollar's decline as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street  up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.  Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it   said David Jones  economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances  short of further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation  scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce  while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson  Mellon Bank chief economist  called the markets' instability frightening. He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that  once you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.   There's a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.  Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington  has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.  We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But the agony may be fairly drawn out   Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year  but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing  whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience  which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline  Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen  the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon  by contrast  said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports  raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S.  Reflected in the massive budget deficit. But in the short term  given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention  some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.  The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad  at least by Japan   said Lanston's Jones. Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates  even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers  Latin American governments and others. But Robert Giordano  chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co  scoffed at the notion.  It's ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency. This is yen strength  not dollar weakness   he said. Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.  We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year  and nobody cares   he said  noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater. He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year. But for now  market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out.  Put on your helmets   Giordano said."

"2","Bank of Japan sources said the bankhas no plans to cut its discount rate. They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo  which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985  over a long-time span  not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting  Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S.  Hurting the U.S. And world economies  they said. In February and in March of this year  Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds  the sources said. Each country in the G-7 - Britain  Canada  France  Italy  Japan  the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability  the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen  European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement  European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening  they said."
"2","Countries meeting at theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) this week are looking at a variety of new ways to resolve the problem of third world debt  Swiss National Bank president Pierre Languetin said. Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMF Interim Committee today reached a consensus that a rescheduling like that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. The Mexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved six months after it started. Various members suggested other options to break the deadlock between debtor countries and their creditors  he said. Languetin said no recommendations were agreed  but he listed some of the suggestions. One involved individual banking systems each resolving the problem of small banks which refused to participate in reschedulings. It was this problem that had prevented completion of the Mexican rescheduling  he said. Debt-equity swaps could be expanded  as could 'on-lending'  which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending' allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts. Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might be forced to sign  exit bonds   prohibiting them from lending to that country again  he said. Languetin said none of these represented a general view. But he added  People are trying to get out of the corset."
"2","Swiss National Bank President PierreLanguetin said a wider interest rate differential between the dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar's fall.

But what would be useful is a greater differential in interest rates   he said."
"2","National Bank economic data for 1986shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew  the inflation rate rose  wages were sharply higher  the money supply expanded and the value of the dinar fell. The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs  25.7 pct higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct  in hard currency terms  to 2.124 billion dlrs. Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in dinars based on current exchange rates  instead of dollars based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar. Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344 mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency area rose 11.6 pct from 1985  while imports rose 17.8 pct. Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct  the bank's data showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct. Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986. Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages were too high given the level of productivity. Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity. Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3 895.9 billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs abroad  mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe. The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the Swiss franc  85.3 pct  and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar  46.2 pct."

Macao will become a special administrative region on December 20  1999  retaining a high degree of autonomy except in foreign affairs and defence. Its capitalist system is to remain intact for 50 years under an arrangement similar to the one that will return Hong Kong to China from Britain in 1997. China hopes to win back the Nationalist-ruled island of Taiwan under the same  one country  two systems  formula.  The successful settlement of the question of Macao has proven and will continue to prove that the concept of 'one country  two systems' is realistic and therefore definitely viable   Zhao said. Macao's population of 300 000 includes more than 40 000 Portuguese passport holders. Peking has said Chinese nationals in this category will be able to use their Portuguese passports after 1999 but will not be entitled to Portuguese consular protection in Macao or elsewhere in China."
"2","Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused an electoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's local elections  political analysts said. The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships  but failed to restore a governorship in Fukuoka it had placed much importance on winning. In the prefectural assembly elections to fill 2 670 seats  the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previously held 1 487 seats to the socialists and communists. Full election results should be available later today. Discussing the election results with reporters  Nakasone said   I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had no effect at all  but there were other factors  such as a low turnout and unusually cold weather.  The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the 13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 59.78 pct while the prefectural assembly polls drew an average of 66.66 pct  also a record low. Noboru Goto  president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a longtime friend of Nakasone  told reporters the impact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious.  The government should take action (on the sales tax) in regard to the people's wishes   Goto said. Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at a delay in the implementation of the tax  which had been scheduled for next January  and a possible cut in the rate.  The most important thing now is to get parliamentary approval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapid appreciation of the yen   Nakasone said.

"2","Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused an electoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's local elections  political analysts said. The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships  but failed to restore a governorship in Fukuoka it had placed much importance on winning. In the prefectural assembly elections to fill 2 670 seats  the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previously held 1 487 seats to the socialists and communists. Full election results should be available later today. Discussing the election results with reporters  Nakasone said   I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had no effect at all  but there were other factors  such as a low turnout and unusually cold weather.  The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the 13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 59.78 pct while the prefectural assembly polls drew an average of 66.66 pct  also a record low. Noboru Goto  president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a longtime friend of Nakasone  told reporters the impact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious.  The government should take action (on the sales tax) in regard to the people's wishes   Goto said. Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at a delay in the implementation of the tax  which had been scheduled for next January  and a possible cut in the rate.  The most important thing now is to get parliamentary approval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapid appreciation of the yen   Nakasone said.  We must implement measures to prop up the economy.  Opposition parties said the elections were a referendum on the tax and they will continue to demand its retraction."

"2","Japanese trade figures are seriouslychallenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems. Senior Japanese  U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data  for if currencies are the key they ask  why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan shrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them  fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of world trade recession? U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York. The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan. The officials  most of them economists  can offer no objective reason why they are not. Worse  how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen.? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower. So worst of all  what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation  officials can only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.  I don't know and I don't think anyone knows   said Hugh Richardson  acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.  What I do know is that Community exporters are making a hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort  there is money to be made in Japan   he added. But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S. Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade practices  protected Japanese trade sectors  such as agriculture  and non-tariff barriers  such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports. Publicly  Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private  they blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.  We see it that way  but we don't like to seem arrogant   said a senior official  who declined to be named.  We like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.  Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito  chairman of the Keidanren business group  and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand Japan's markets  and some foreigners agree.  The real issue is the inability of major sectors of American and European industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets   Peter Huggler  President of Interallianz Bank Zurich  told a recent conference in Switzerland.

"2","West German Economics Minister MartinBangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks. In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint spring report  Bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --  The government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.  Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased. Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987  with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct. Bangemann said  The government  agreeing with the majority  sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority.  He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year  partly because of a further increase in world trade."
"2","Top officials of leading industrialnations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies  which they believe they strengthened in talks last week. Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets  which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too  did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada. Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement  and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying:  I don't believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar.  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollar's latest rapid descent  involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation  leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.  But there were signs too  that while policymakers feared the market uproar  they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed  and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result. Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession. Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.  It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us  if not (into) recession  into slower growth   he said. Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the dollar  Balladur said:  When a currency is maintained artificially high  by artificially high interest rates  it is not healthy.  And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession  he said. Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of life  Balladur said   there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies  this is not a fixed rate system.  But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens. U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.  The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements   Baker told the meetings. Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar. Baker  Darman said  was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels. Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism. West Germany and Japan  meanwhile  agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn. Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget. The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement  when the dollar stood higher. The Paris accord said   currencies (are) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals  given the policy commitments summarized in this statement.  Now they accept the dollar's lower level  especially against the yen  as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement.  The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals   last week's statement read. Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S. Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit."
"2","Portugal's economy  which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest government crisis  analysts said. But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community  which it joined in January last year  they said. Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party  PSD  was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties. The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office. In 1986  Portugal's economy grew four pct  its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct  from 20 pct in 1985. Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.  The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation   said Fritz Haser  economics professor at Universidade Livre  Lisbon.  The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet   economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters. Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress. The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution. Portugal's developing stock markets  however  remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts. Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast  released on the day the PSD government fell  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year. But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development. Soares  who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month  can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament. Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution.  There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections   Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said. He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year. The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution  but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority. A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms  such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry  the analysts said. Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms. The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports  than of PSD policies."

"2","Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform ofits financial system with a package of measures designed to boost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrative world of investment banking. Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift in policy stemming from a need to tackle the underlying contradiction between an Islamic legal framework and western banking system. One senior banker in Jeddah said:  There is a new wind blowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner that is extraordinarily aggressive.  The speed of reform  begun last year but now gathering pace  has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a financial system that restricted internationalisation of the riyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting difficult. Saudi banks  once the most profitable in the world  have generally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth successive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into already dwindling earnings. Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy although it remains to be seen how it will be implemented. Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously dormant stock trading  but took off in earnest this year. -- From January 1  SAMA liberalised the money market  giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase agreements. -- From March 22  the Finance Ministry abolished withholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad. -- From the same date  banks were notified of a new committee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank disputes with creditors over non-payment of loans. -- Also from the same date  banks were allowed to use mortgages as collateral for lending  banned since 1981. -- Within a few weeks  the Kingdom's first stock market trading floor is expected to be opened. Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi Industrial Development Fund  the floor will initially be used to trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11 commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a new computer network has been set up. One banker said:  The abolition of withholding tax will give banks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as interest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance Ministry are opening up markets for investment banking.  Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked into reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance to extend further loans to the private sector. Banks have lobbied hard for change  arguing that the religious  or Sharia  legal framework was inconsistent with the Kingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible for them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts. As a result  many banks had virtually stopped new lending  but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a series of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively expensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps. The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill in bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the mountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant families also called for change  bankers said.  Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force change -- they stopped lending   another banker said.  That was stifling growth of the economy.  It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be set up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more efficient than another non-Sharia system already in force  the Committees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs). Some bankers believe the new committee  yet to be formed  will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series of private deals with creditors. Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on interest payments  generally not recognised under Islamic law. But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA and the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were not the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes. Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a new body would examine late government payments to contractors. In addition  further moves are under way to align business life to the Gregorian calendar year  with companies being urged to adopt it as their financial year. A black list of borrowers  started more than two years ago by banks  has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA  bankers say. Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities transactions with any party on the list."
"2","World Bank President Barber Conablesaid he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt because the proposal  if adopted  would lead to a cutoff in lending to the indebted countries.  I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create an environment in which no more money will go into development and a lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and to instability indefinitely   he told ABC Television on Sunday. A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion of the debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.  I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuous improvement in policies  of wise use of money in short  rather than trying to turn everybody off   Conable said. Conable told ABC's  Business World  he supported Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt plan as an  andidote to debt.  Baker has said the best way to reduce the developing countries' debt burden is to boost their growth rates through reformed domestic policies and increased commercial bank lending."
"2","Argentine Treasury Secretary MarioBrodersohn said the country is near accord with creditor banks on refinancing about 30 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Brodersohn  in an interview from Washington with Argentine television  said Saturday the major obstacles to an agreement with creditor banks had been overcome.  Only details remain to be resolved   he said. Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille on Thursday in a speech at the IMF accused creditor banks of standing in the way of an accord by demanding conditions incompatible with Argentina's IMF standby program. Brodersohn said that since there  has been progress. I'd say that we are now working on the fine print of the agreement.  Negotiations between Argentina and the banks have been stuck over differences on the question of capitalisation of the debt as well as on-lending programs. Argentina has resisted a renewal of on-lending programs and sought an agreement whereby creditor banks would invest a fresh dollar for every dollar of debt capitalised."
"2","U.S. Secretary of State George Shultzwas holding several hours of talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze today in pursuit of the first superpower arms control agreement in nearly a decade. Shultz  accompanied by a panoply of senior advisers and technical experts  went directly into a closed-door meeting with Shevardnadze and the Soviet delegation after arriving in Moscow from Helsinki aboard a U.S. Air Force jet. State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters traveling with the secretary that as the crucial talks got under way  U.S. Arms control advisers were instructed not to discuss the substance of the American proposals with the press. It has been reported previously that some of the proposals -- such as those dealing with President Ronald Reagan's  Star Wars  space shield against enemy missiles -- represent a hardening of the U.S. Position. Nevertheless  U.S. Officials have been optimistic about the possibility of progress on arms control during the talks  which are scheduled to end Wednesday. Reagan  who is believed to want an agreement before he leaves office in 1989  said last week that a breakthrough on an accord eliminating intermediate-range missiles (INF) in Europe was a distinct possibility."
"2","Nearly 50 manufacturers and tradegroups asked the Reagan Administration for exclusions from the tariffs it is to impose on Japanese exports Friday. Several police agencies also told a special screening panel they wanted a Japanese-made fingerprinting system to be excluded because it was vital for crime-fighting. Another 25 firms are to testify tomorrow. President Reagan announced the tariffs on March 27 to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets outside the United States at below cost and to open its own market to U.S. goods. U.S. semiconductor makers had complained they were being injured by Japan's unfair trade practices. The tariffs of 100 pct - up from about five pct - are to be applied to 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese exports including power tools  television sets  computer parts and audio equipment  in addition to the fingerprinting equipment. Reagan issued a list of several dozen products that could be subject to the tariffs  and businessmen  lobbyists and others asked for the exclusions in the two days of public testimony that began today at the Commerce Department. He said  action should be taken in such a manner that efforts to help the semiconductor industry do not inflict extensive economic damage on the highly successful information technology industry.  A spokesman for Amdahl Corp &lt;AMH>  a computer maker  said it would be hit hard by tariffs on Fujitsu Ltd equipment because Fujitsu was its only supplier of key electronic components. Makita U.S.A.  Inc  a maker of hand-held electric power tools  said if tariffs were imposed on its goods it would have to close its U.S. manufacturing operation in Buford  Ga.  and layoff its entire U.S. workforce of 600 people. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office  which is conducting the hearings  said the products to be assessed the higher tariffs will be made public on Thursday or Friday. It said it would base its judgment on the impact of the tariffs on the companies hit as well as on the buying public. Some of the tariffs would double the price of imports. Law officers from California  Illinois  Alaska and elsewhere said they relied on NEC Corp of Japan's advanced fingerprinting system and asked it be exempt from the new tariffs. Fred Wynbrandt  representing the California attorney general's office  said the tariffs would double California state and local costs for fingerprinting operations. Many of those testifying backed the idea of retaliatory tariffs but not on some goods that would hit their business. Vico Henriques  president of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association  called for exemptions for components that U.S. firms bought in Japan and for goods made in Japan under a U.S. license or by a joint venture. more &#3;</BODY></TEXT>"
"2","Some of the United States' largestaerospace firms are competing with some of the world's most powerful nations for a chance to cash in on the coming commercialization of space. The newest space race is for contracts to launch privately owned satellites into orbit - a business expected to be worth two billion to five billion dlrs annually in a few years. The growing opportunities to make money in space will be highlighted this month when the U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration seeks lucrative commercial bids to lauch future weather satellites  ending its long-standing dependence on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Companies and countries with established satellite launching operations may also get a jump on eventually providing other space-based services  particularly if the proposed international manned space station is launched as planned in the early 1990s. The 12 billion dlr space station  first proposed by President Reagan in 1984  could require as many as 16 cargo deliveries a year  many delivered by private firms. The partners in the space station are currently slated to be Canada  Japan  and the 13-nation European Space Agency  the latter two of which also have or are developing their own commercial space programs. Until the Challenger explosion in January 1986  NASA had a virtual lock on the world's commercial space cargo. But after a re-evaluation of the shuttle program  President Reagan declared last August that future U.S. shuttle flights will no longer carry commercial payloads. The administration's decision left Arianespace  a French-led European consortium  the only option available to satellite owners and the concern quickly sold out all its planned flights through 1989. The company also raised its prices  from 30 000 dlrs a launch to 50 000 dlrs  but even the larger price tag did not dampen demand. Arianespace sighned 18 new contracts last year  compared with 11 in 1985. Those kind of tariffs have caused even non-capitalist countries to try and get a piece of the action. China  the Soviet Union and Japan have all announced satellite launch programs and several U.S. firms  including McDonnell Douglas Corp  General Dynamics Corp and Martin Marietta promised to spend mlns of dollars over the next three years to develop their own satellite launch capabilities. There will be some tremendous pent-up demand for satellite launches by then  analysts said. Without Challenger  there were only three satellite launches last year  15 fewer than in 1985 and the lowest since 1980  when only two were sent up. Ariane expects to launch from six to eight satellites a year for the next three years  about 75 pct of the world's satellite launches during that period. McDonnell Douglas scored the biggest coup of the U.S. firms in January when it won a 734 mln dlr U.S. Air Force pact for up to 20 unmanned rockets to launch military satellites. The contract is expected to underwrite the company's efforts to build rockets for private satellite launches. Martin Marietta  however  was the first U.S. company to sign up a client  Federal Express Co. Marietta plans to launch an ExpressStar communications satellite in 1989. Marietta said it will also build a version of its Titan rockets used by the Air Force to other private companies that want to get into the satellite launch buisiness. Arianespace director Charles Bigot said the U.S. companies will probably become the European firm's biggest competitors for satellite launching. He does not expect the national space programs to become commercially viable until the late 1990s. Japan has expanded its space program  launching 38 government-owned satellites in the last 16 years. But most of them were small and it was only in February it launched its first satellite that circles the earth over the poles. Japan also has yet to design and build its own rockets. The satellite launched in February was placed in orbit by a McDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled by the Japanese under license. Tsugo Tadakawa  director of the Washington office of Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA)  said Japan plans to launch seven of its H-1 rockets  an American Japanese hybrid that replaces the Delta  through 1991. Its much larger sucessor  the H-II  should be ready by 1992  he said. NASDA's annual budget is only about 800 mln dlrs  Tadakawa said  about 10 pct the size of NASA's yearly spending. Still  NASDA is free from private competition at home and has the full support of the government  since aerospace was chosen by the Ministry of Trade and Information as one of the country's new industries for the next decade. Surprisingly  the People's Republic of China  a relative newcomer to aerospace  is so far the most successful competitor to Ariane. The country's Great Wall Industry Corp is the only national program besides the European consortium to win a private satellite contract. It will launch a Westar communications satellite for New-York based Terasat in 1988."
"2","White House officialssaid no progress had been made in talks with Japan on a dispute on Japanese microchip sales. President Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci told reporters  it looks like a very difficult situation at this point.  The Reagan administration is due to slap 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese products on Friday in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets outside the U.S. and failure to open its own market to U.S. goods. White House chief of staff Howard Baker said that talks with the Japanese had failed to provide any reason to prevent the publication of a proclamation on Friday putting the new duties in effect.  I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday   Baker said. Carlucci said that the evidence of Japanese microchip dumping at below production costs in third countries had been fairly conclusive. He said that in U.S.-Japanese talks that concluded last Friday  Japanese officials presented statistics to show that Japan had made its market more open to American products.  Our statistics do not confirm this  indeed they tend to go in the other direction   Carlucci said. Baker and Carlucci appeared before White House reporters as Reagan enjoyed a vacation at his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara."
"2","FMC Corp's 225 mln dlr insider tradingcase against Wall Street arbitrageur Ivan Boesky was dismissed by a federal court  a court clerk said. Federal Judge Ann C. Williams  in an oral ruling  said FMC had not been harmed by trading in FMC stock by Boesky and other traders prior to FMC's two-billion dlr recapitalization last year. FMC had claimed insider trading by Boesky had forced it to increase the value of the recapitalization to 80 dlrs a share from 70 dlrs a share. FMC had charged that Boesky received confidential information about FMC's planned recapitalization from Dennis Levine  a former merger specialist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. An FMC spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry that FMC might appeal the ruling  made in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois  once a formal written decision is received. The written ruling is expected April 15. The spokeswoman said FMC might appeal alleged contract violations involved in the dispute. That part of the case  involving a contract between FMC and Goldman Sachs and Co  would be appealed to an Illinois state court  she said. Goldman Sachs was FMC's investment banker in its planned restructuring. A FMC spokeswoman said the contract was a standard contract under which Goldman Sachs advised FMC on the restructuring.  We are certainly taking a look at appealing  the ruling in Illinois state court  the FMC spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry. The suit claimed that Boesky bought 95 300 FMC shares between February 18 and February 21  1986  selling those shares for a profit of 975 000 dlrs on February 21  the day FMC first said it was considering a recapitalization. Also  the suit said Boesky bought a further 1 922 000 FMC shares between March 12 and April four  acknowledging the purchase of a 7.5 pct stake in the company in a 13-D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April seven.  We alleged his actions kept the stock price artificially high and put pressure on FMC to increase the terms of the recapitalization   the FMC spokeswoman said.

President Reagan's chief of staff  Howard Baker told reporters here that he saw no developments that that would cause the president to back away from his plan to issue a proclamation on Friday slapping 100 per cent tariffs on a range of Japanese electronic products.  I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday   Baker said. Reagan's National Security Adviser  Frank Carlucci added   It looks like a very difficult situation at this point.  Carlucci said that evidence of Japanese  dumping  of microchips had been  fairly conclusive.  The alleged dumping -- selling abroad at below the cost of manufacture -- is said to have undercut the technologically important U.S. microchip industry. Carlucci also said that although Japanese officials had presented statistics designed to show that Japan was opening its markets to American producers of microchips   our statistics do not confirm this.   Indeed  they tend to go in the other direction  Carlucci said. President Reagan announced on March 27 that he planned to raise tariffs on as much as 300 mln dlrs in Japanese exports to the United States. He accused Japan of failing to enforce major provisions of a September 1986 agreement on preventing microchip dumping and providing American industry with fair trade opportunities. He said he would be prepared to lift the sanctions when Japan took corrective action on these two issues. The dispute has soured U.S.-Jpanese relations as Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone prepares to visit Washington at the end of the month for talks with Reagan. Last Friday Reagan  answering questions following a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council  said Nakasone had endangered his political standing at home because of his willingess to try to eliminate trade barriers against U.S. goods. He said he was looking forward to his talks with Nakasone and  he has been most helpful.  Today Reagan was vacationing at his ranch near here."

"2","Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced aseries of conferences will be held across Canada to review the country's policy options in the energy sector.  It is planned as a comprehensive review of Canadian energy issues  an examination of the present energy situation  an attempt to identify and evaluate our options for the future   Masse said in a speech at a luncheon in Toronto that was made available here. The meetings  which will be chaired by Tom Kierans  President of McLeod  Young Weir Ltd  will begin in June in Calgary  Alberta and conclude in December in Montreal. The energy minister did not elaborate on what  if any  federal legislation would result from the process. A final report would be issued at the end of the conference sessions and Masse said he would be in a position to respond to the report at that time. In his speech  however  Masse said he would prefer to see the government's energy policies retain a market base  but added government intervention was sometimes necessary.  I believe most of us accept the importance of allowing the market to function with the greatest possible freedom and flexibility   he said.  However  because of intervention of all kinds  a market as perfect as we would like to have does not exist in this imperfect world   Masses said."

"2","International banks have radicallychanged their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtor nations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows  Philippine Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez said.  Commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult in terms of new money for some time now   he told reporters at a news conference.  Within the world there are enormous changes taking place in attitudes of different banks.  He said the banks were no longer flush with funds from the post-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.  They don't have the same kind of money they used to have ... They find their whole deposit base eroding   Fernandez said. Groups of major banks had decided that the international arena was not to their liking.  They wind up with 7/8 (over Eurodollar rates) and who wants 7/8 really? It's nothing. They want to get the frills  but if they are not big enough they don't get the frills.  The Philippines on Wednesday announced it wanted to renegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on March 27 with its 12-bank advisory committee  saying it wanted the same terms as were granted to Argentina earlier this week. Argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 points over Eurodollar rates  the same historically low spread that Mexico won last October  while the Philippines  which had insisted on a deal similar to Mexico's  restructured 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8. Fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement  where hundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by an advisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtor countries  was becoming increasingly difficult. He said involuntary lending proved useful in the two or three years since the Mexican debt crisis in 1982.  But the present tendency has been that more and more of the banks  specially the regionals or the small ones  have either sold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put up any more money   Fernandez said. He said another disturbing development was the so-called national quota approach adopted by groups of banks.  Groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a look at what other groups of banks in other countries are willing to do and if let us say British banks wind up giving 99 pct of what is needed and U.S. Banks give only 92 pct  then the British banks say as a whole they will pull out   he said.  There are banks that have decided that lending is not a good business any more. They want to deal in securities  they want to go into investment banking  they want to go into the turnover business rather than the carry business   Fernandez said.  We have to thread our way through a constellation of banks  all of whom have different objectives.  He said in order to survive  the Philippines would have to try and stimulate new types of inflows   whether this be direct investments  whether this be investments by institutions that now have chosen not to lend but to invest  or whether this be debt to equity conversions."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngopens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice  beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected. But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to Tokyo yesterday  Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets.  (The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming  but they are not going to give us anything   Lyng said. U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month  they said.  If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him   when he visits Washington later in the month  one U.S. Official said. Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases. A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200 000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture  saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice. Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed. He cited the example of a California company which transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal  he said. U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports  was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports. Along with beef  the U.S. Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April  1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry. The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice  U.S. And Japanese officials have said. Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries  but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken. Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies  including rice  on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals."

"2","President Reagan today is toannounce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade. The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara  where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement  Reagan said  I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.  He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:   we do not want a trade war  but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.  Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation  saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and  in any case  that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact  but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials  however  have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs  it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States."
"2","White House Budget chief JamesMiller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might  overreact  to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates  a move he said could cause a recession next year.  Our greatest danger is overreaction   Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday.  I'm concerned about the Fed's overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply.  Edwin Dale  Miller's spokesman  said the remarks  published in the New York Times today  were accurate. Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have  political consequences.  The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year.  My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup  and there is no question about it   he said. Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit. Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar. Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects. U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States."
"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned. Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports  he said  slim to none.  Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products. Yeutter  on the NBC program  Today   said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement. He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact  but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance. Asked how long that would take  he said  We want to see a pattern of compliance  so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.  Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers. He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.  It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well   Yeutter said. He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  but  that's more of a paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.  Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. He said he hoped the visit  which is to have trade as a major issue  would be productive but  I don't see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone'sunpopular sales tax plan suffered another dent today when members of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called for time to be taken in dealing with the proposed sales tax  party officials said. The call came in a resolution adopted by a group of some 150 LDP parliamentarians and secretaries  acting on behalf of their parliamentarians  at a meeting at the LDP headquarters  they said. The MPs represented seemed to Account for one-third of LDP MPs. The group is an LDP voluntary organisation  called the Parliamentarians' Research Society for Reestablishment of Finances claiming a membership of about 300 MPs  they said. Meanwhle  Nakasone this evening hinted that his party might be ready to accept some modification to the five-pct sales tax proposal after the fiscal 1987 state budget plan was passed by parliament. The LDP suffered a setback in last Sunday's local elections because of the controvertial tax plan. The result also undermined Nakasone's prestige  giving rise to a possibility that he might be forced out of office before October 30  when he is supposed to step down."
"2","Senior U.S. bankers are seeking tocalm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms of Argentina's new financing package  but a source in New York close to the Manila government said finance minister Jaime Ongpin is in no mood for compromise. Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina an interest rate spread of 13/16 pct  the same as Mexico won  just weeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 7/8 pct because the Mexican margin could never be repeated. Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of the interest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentine package in its entirety. Argentina  for instance  is offering banks a 3/8 pct participation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days (declining to 1/8 pct if banks commit within 60 days)  which boosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package.  You can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct   one banker said. Another  referring to the Philippine debt negotiators  said  The only reason they'd have to come back to New York is political  not economic.  Ongpin has said as much himself  estimating that an extra 1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year. But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's anger goes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personally betrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was a rock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same. The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. to press his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisory committee  headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co  to negotiate the spread reduction by telex. Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start paying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the committee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than Mexico and Argentina  the source said.  The Philippines really means business on this. I don't think there's much room for compromise   he said. Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue. The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule 10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of 7/8 pct  whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt will be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct. Bankers said they were forced to break their word because political circumstances had changed in the past few weeks. In particular  they said it had become clear that Argentina was serious about its threat to suspend interest payments unless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratorium would stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil  which has already suspended payments  the banks  at the urging of the Reagan Administration  bowed to Argentina's demands. Some U.S. bankers argued that  regardless of politics  the rich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it attractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.  When they (the Philippines) see the whole package  they may realize that this is not a Mexican deal   one banker said of the Argentine agreement. The Argentine pact contains several features that were not in the Mexican accord such as  exit bonds   an option to provide new money via bearer bonds  a trade facility  onlending provisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme. Moreover  Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs in new loans  compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion  and is paying 7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct charged to Mexico. This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos  who note drily that they asked for no new money at all.  The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina and try to justify it in terms of economics  and now they're going to have problems with both the Philippines and Venezuela   said the source close to the Manila government. Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an official reaction from Venezuela  which is also paying 7/8 pct on its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledged that Caracas  which was also told that the Mexico spread was inviolate  is quite likely to demand a lower spread. Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile. Because it is under fire for its human-rights record  the government of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract attention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt package  which carries interest of one pct  bankers said. They hope that  once tempers cool  the Philippines will also accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 tough months to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth."
"2","The tough trade sanctions PresidentReagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide  U.S. officials said. But Robert Crandall  a trade specialist at Brookings Institution  a think tank  said  a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern.  He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws  and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum  Taiwan over beer and wine  South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights  patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a  serious signal  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer  Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not  Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs  and continues to rise  with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada  West Germany  Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that  I regret that these actions are necessary   but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets.  We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices   Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara. He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement. U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade. The White House aide said of the tariff action   it wasn't done to appease Congress  but because there was an unfair trade practice.  The aide added  however   on another plane  it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices  an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.  But the analyst  Crandall  said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States  and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.  It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route   he said   because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.  Crandall said   the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country  and therefore its impact on Congress.  He said   I don't think it makes a lot of sense.  But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use. Spokesman Fitzwater said  we don't want a trade war   but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

"2","U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today.  I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on American products   Yeutter told Cable News Network.  Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation   Yeutter said. Earlier today  Reagan imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade. Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back.  If they (Japan) were to retaliate  it would probably be on something like American agricultural products   he said.  But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none   he added."
"2","Japan does not plan to take immediateretaliatory action against implementation of U.S. Tariffs on some Japanese electronic goods  the minister of international trade and industry  Hajime Tamura  said in a statement. Japan requested bilateral consultations in accordance with Article 23-1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Washington yesterday. Tamura said there was deep regret over the U.S. Measures  which will impose 100 pct tariffs on about 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese imports of some small computers  colour television sets and power tools."
"2","The Asian Development Bank (ADB) willnot change its decision to admit China as a member despite protests from founder member Taiwan  bank president Masao Fujioka said. China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the bank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei  China' caused a Taiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila. Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been invited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in Osaka   but the situation remains the same.   The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei  China'   Fujioka said.  We have tried to maintain our channels of communication through the Taiwanese director  but we are not negotiating with a view to changing our agreement with China   he said. ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among the bank's developing members  with 7.2 pct of its equity. Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam  which complained at last year's meeting that for several years the ADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans. An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was made to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974. Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan were disbursed. The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for Vietnam  eight had been closed  two were suspended and only one was under administration at the end of 1986. Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986 totalled 25.3 mln dlrs  or 99.5 pct of the total amount of effective loans  the report said.  The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank operations   Fujioka said.  Vietnam continues to be a member. We would like to help it  but new loans seem to be difficult.   It's not a question of political instability  the environment has to be right for banking operations.  He said with the first loans made to India in 1986  and lending operations in China scheduled to start this year  the ADB had now acquired a  truly Asian  character. Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of experience in borrowing from the World Bank  ADB loans would be routed through the country's central bank  Fujioka said.  It's been a very slow start   Fujioka said.  We identified three projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only two left.  He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln dlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project. He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India. The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250 mln dlrs.  There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should be modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender   Fujioka said. He did not give details. Fujioka said the ADB saw its lending to the private sector serving as a catalyst. The bank's new private sector division in 1986 approved three loans totalling 11.46 mln dlrs without government guarantees. In addition  the ADB approved four equity investment projects totalling 8.15 mln dlrs. This raised to 15.18 mln the cumulative approvals since equity financing commenced in 1983. But Fujioka said the ADB should not compete with private banks.  We have a narrow path to walk   he said. He said he was happy with the decision of the bank's donor countries to increase the ADB's fund for soft loans. The fourth replenishment of the soft-loan window  the Asian Development Fund   brought it to 3.6 billion dlrs  from 3.2 billion  Fujioka said. In particular the United States has maintained its 16 pct share   said the ADB chief. He said there had been disagreements with the U.S.  Which holds 14.9 pct of the bank's equity  over lending policies. The U.S. Complained in 1986 the ADB was granting bad loans in its impatience to hit lending targets.  I suspect there is some arm-twisting   he said.  I find some developed countries are more interested in the procurement side instead of the development side.  Fujioka said he said he foresaw increased sectoral lending and a gradual dilution of the ADB's project-tied lending. Fujioka said project lending was expected to drop to 63 pct of total loans in 1987  from 66.5 pct in 1986 and 77.5 pct in 1985. He said sectoral lending was projected to rise to 20 pct in 1987  from 12.8 pct in 1986 and 7.5 pct in 1985. He said the bank would try to reduce some of its liquid assets by repaying borrowings carrying high interest rates.  On the other hand we must maintain our presence in major financial markets   he said.  Why should we not take advantage of historically low interest rates?"
"2","Japan's policy of self-sufficiency inrice is an example of extreme protectionism  visiting U.S. Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference. He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan had a large export balance  not just with the U.S. But with other countries  it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product. Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture minister Mutsuki Kato  Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan. Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.  We want to have some access in the rice market   he said. He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He told reporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan on rice. Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency. Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue  Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Rice industry would do. Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or August this year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by the U.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in the meantime. U.S. Rice industry officials have indicated they would consider filing another complaint against the Japan rice import ban."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid Japanese government officials do not seem to understand that protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to an explosive situation and protectionist legislation. Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan  Lyng said protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly during the last six months.  It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive. We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory laws which would have very serious consequences for other countries  especially Japan   Lyng told reporters. Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision  requiring retaliation against countries which have trade surpluses with the U.S.  Trade analysts said. U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley  a Washington Democrat  yesterday predicted during a visit here that the Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade legislation is taken up later this month. Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the volatility of the situation in the U.S.  Where Congress is increasingly unpredictable  he said.  The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I cannot emphasise that enough   Lyng said. In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato yesterday  Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import quotas on beef and citrus. Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S. Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response in Congress  where legislation on rice retaliation has been introduced in both the House and Senate. Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products since 1964  especially grains. He said the U.S. Understands Japan  with a limited land area  is concerned about maintaining some level of self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons. But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture. Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of farm products as it did in 1973."
"2","The Bank of Japan is carefully watchingthe recent rapid rise of the Tokyo stock and yen bond markets for their impact on inflation  governor Satoshi Sumita said. In a statement to the bank's regional branch managers  Sumita said the central bank was particularly monitoring the markets because of the recent rapid growth of money supply. He said he is also carefully watching real estate prices. Sumita said he expects money supply growth to remain high from April through June. In March  money supply  as measured by M-2 plus certificates of deposit  rose at a year-on-year rate of nine pct."
"2","The Asian Development Bank (ADB) willnot change its decision to admit China as a member despite protests from founder member Taiwan  bank president Masao Fujioka said. China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the bank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei  China' caused a Taiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila. Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been invited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in Osaka   but the situation remains the same.   The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei  China'   Fujioka said.  We have tried to maintain our channels of communication through the Taiwanese director  but we are not negotiating with a view to changing our agreement with China   he said. ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among the bank's developing members  with 7.2 pct of its equity. Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam  which complained at last year's meeting that for several years the ADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans. An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was made to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974. Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan were disbursed. The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for Vietnam  eight had been closed  two were suspended and only one was under administration at the end of 1986. Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986 totalled 25.3 mln dlrs  or 99.5 pct of the total amount of effective loans  the report said.  The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank operations   Fujioka said.  Vietnam continues to be a member. We would like to help it  but new loans seem to be difficult.   It's not a question of political instability  the environment has to be right for banking operations.  He said with the first loans made to India in 1986  and lending operations in China scheduled to start this year  the ADB had now acquired a  truly Asian  character. Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of experience in borrowing from the World Bank  ADB loans would be routed through the country's central bank  Fujioka said.  It's been a very slow start   Fujioka said.  We identified three projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only two left.  He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln dlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project. He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India. The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250 mln dlrs.  There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should be modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender   Fujioka said. He did not give details."
"2","The Japanese government is consideringbuying U.S.-made supercomputers to help defuse mounting trade friction between the two countries  Trade Minister Hajime Tamura was quoting as saying. Japanese officials said Tamura told visiting U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter that the government may set aside money for the purchase of the supercomputers in a supplementary budget to be drawn up later this year. But he emphasised that the matter was still under study and that no firm decision had been made. Tamura urged Yeutter to lift the trade sanctions imposed against Japan and argued that the yen's rapid rise was already working to correct the country's trade imbalance. But  according to Japanese officials  Yeutter held out little hope that the American trade sanctions would be lifted soon and said the United States needed action from Japan to boost its domestic demand and imports  not just words. In order to lift the tariffs imposed on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese exports last Friday  the U.S. Needs proof that its joint computer chip pact with Japan is working. And that will take time  Yeutter was quoted as telling Tamura."
"2","Federal Reserve Board Governor WayneAngell said the Reagan appointed majority on the board was not at odds with Chairman Paul Volcker on whether interest rates should rise to support the dollar.  I would anticipate very little difference between the chairman's position on price-level stability - and on the view of the dollar in foreign exchange markets - and my own   Angell said in an interview with the New York Times.  And I would also see very little difference in (Governor) Manley Johnson's position and my own   he added. The newspaper said Angell was speaking in response to inquiries concerning a report by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Volcker was ready to raise rates to defend the dollar but that he was being thwarted by the four Reagan appointed members on the board. Angell told the newspaper that there was no evidence of disagreement on the board and that  anyone who should suggest  there is one  might be reaching pretty far."
"2","The Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC plans to sell in a series of auctions over the next few weeks robusta coffee purchased in London last year  but details of where and when auctions will take place are still to be finalised  IBC president Jorio Dauster told reporters. The sales of 630 000 bags of robusta and an unspecified amount of Brazilian arabica coffee will take place over a minimum of six months but it is not decided where sales will take place or whether they will be held weekly or monthly. The amount offered at each sale has also not been set  but could be in the order of 100 000 bags  Dauster said."
"2","Congress returned from its Easterrecess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises to be a partisan dispute. The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is taking on new prominence because of current trade woes. That is because the budget problems and its associated huge deficits are said to be at the root of related international trade friction currently worrying financiers. As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock exchanges gyrate wildly  the trade dispute involving the United States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade war between the two trading giants for the first time since World War II. Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions and small computers. Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither side wants  is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit. Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to grow without repercussions. A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they withdraw this support the result can only be further problems  including higher interest rates for Americans. In a nutshell  the U.S. budget process has now moved to the showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar spending budget for the government year 1988  starting Oct. 1  was trounced badly in the House on April 9. The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the House  calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171 billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs  through defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs in new  unspecified  taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up its own budget plan  majority Democrats predict there will be passage of a bill  only after a protracted partisan battle. In the House  not one Republican voted for the budget  which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate  none of Reagan's Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate Budget Committee for full Senate consideration. A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design among congressional Republicans  perhaps with the tacit approval of the White House.  Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax hikes and defense cuts   he said. In the coming weeks  the source said  Democrats will press for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But  it is not clear how the Republicans will act   he added. He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower taxes and more defense spending  which they did not offer after Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House. When Reagan entered the White House in 1981  he inherited what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year. Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983  critics note that his administration's record of accumulated debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs  or 1 100 billion dlrs. That is money the government must borrow  and pay back  and many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused the worst U.S. trade deficit ever. Last year the United States bought goods from the world worth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold  including purchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods. While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory measures unless all markets are opened  its success so far against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress. Congress  which controls the pursestrings  has put the deficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7 billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986  which ended Sept. 30. Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law enacted in late 1985  there has been pressure on Congress to do more than talk about deficits. That law  named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of Texas  Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest Hollings of South Carolina  calls for a balanced budget by 1991 through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet. The law has been followed  even though an enforcement mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court. The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But in reality  the goal has actually been missed. For example  Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target of a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the numbers  the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion dlrs -- far off the target. This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is expected to be missed widely."
"2","Japan's Lower House passed the 1987budget after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed to a mediation proposal that could kill its plan to introduce a controversial sales tax  political analysts said. The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  the leading advocate of the five pct tax. Some analysts predicted Nakasone might be forced to step down just after the June summit of leaders from major industrial democracies  well before his one-year term is due to expire at the end of October. The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget before Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. so that he could tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to boost the sagging economy and imports."
"2","Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidJapan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support the dollar  other than foreign exchange intervention. He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen. Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the countries involved and the amounts expended  he said. With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen  0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency  such as curbing capital outflows. Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the growth looks robust on the surface  the figures in reality are not that good  he said. He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week. Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone  Miyazawa said it was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect."
"2","The Swiss National Bank will continue totake part in concerted intervention on currency markets as necessary  president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annual meeting. He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows which bore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperation between all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent it breaching thresholds that would damage everyone.  We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to take part in concerted intervention to the extent that this is possible and desirable   Languetin said. Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction the six nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures in February  adding that it had anchored the principle of strengthened international cooperation. He said measures such as recent concerted intervention were useful in the short term. But he added   The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce no lasting effects without a correction of the fundamental imbalances  without a reduction of the American budget deficit and without stronger growth in Europe and Japan.  Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary in the  too expansive  monetary policy of the United States  adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply was expanding too strongly.  If this should last long the dollar could only be stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary policy on the part of the other central banks  which would in turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation   he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities in the most important countries had not relinquished their anti-inflation policies."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone'sunpopular sales tax plan has been defeated and although fellow politicians and political analysts agree he has suffered a grave loss of face only a few are willing to write him off. Michio Watanabe  a Nakasone faction member and deputy secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party  LDP  is one of those who believes he will survive.  He's tough  he won't step down   but  will hang on to the death  at least until his term ends on October 30  Watanabe told Reuters. The sales tax scheme was a mainstay in Nakasone's plans to revamp the nation's tax system for the first time in 36 years. Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was a mistake.  It was too greedy   he said. A two or three pct tariff might have been easier to swallow  he said. One popular school of thought among skeptical analysts is that Nakasone will be remain in office at least until the June 8-10 summit of industrialised nations in Venice. A Western diplomatic observer said he believed that Nakasone would be at the summit as prime minister. But he would not bet on his chances of survival up until October. Masamichi Inoki  a senior fellow at the conservative Institute of Peace and Security  said he did not think Nakasone had suffered irreparable damage.  He will certainly hang on for the summit   Inoki said. In any event  the general belief now is that the five pct sales tax  as championed by Nakasone  is a dead issue but that an indirect tax  in another form  will be introduced by the LDP. Inoki said he believed the issue would be resurrected as early as the next Diet (parliament) meets. The current session finishes on May 27. The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream of opinion  stating that Nakasone might well get another year to deal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform. The government has to find a way of generating revenue to support an expected glut of elderly Japanese. And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy an indirect tax  said Watanabe  a former Minister of International Trade and Industry. The next prime minister will have to grapple with an indirect tax  and  whoever is the next prime minister won't be in the job very long   Watanabe said. Watanabe said he doubted the next prime minister would be any of the three so-called  New Leaders   LDP secretary general Noboru Takeshita  LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe  and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Each of them controls a powerful LDP faction.  It will be somebody else   he said. Political science professor Rei Shiratori of Dokkyo University gave one of the darkest readings on Nakasone's political future.  Soon after the Venice summit  there will be a move to change the government by the New Leaders   Shiratori said.  He can't fight on   he said. He said Nakasone had a special emotional attachment to the sales tax plan as the last and most important item in Japan's purge of policies inherited from the U.S. Occupation. Shiratori said an indirect tax will have to be levied  but  to introduce such a tax  they'll have to change the prime minister.  Nevertheless  Shiratori said he believes Nakasone could hang on until as late as September."

"2","Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boost imports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to Washington next week  LDP officials said. The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth more than 5 000 billion yen  a large-scale supplementary budget for the current fiscal year started April 1  and concentration of more than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the first half of the year  they said. Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials during his visit to Washington starting April 29.  The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package of pump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May. The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its trade surplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growth led by domestic demand  officials said. The government was also urged to review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. The government has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays in the past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy of fiscal reforms.  The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases of foreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goods by improving import financing  and to make clear official procurement procedures for foreign supercomputers. The LDP also said Japan should contribute further to society at large through measures such as doubling its official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or so instead of seven years as the government had originally promised. The government was urged to work out a program to recycle funds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.  The officials said the funds to be recycled would include those from the private sector and others provided through the government Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. The plan also calls for the government to take steps to help the development of African and other less developed nations. The LDP called for adequate and flexible management of monetary policy  such as a cut in interest rates on deposits with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund  and a tax cut to promote plant and equipment investment."
"2","The visit this week by a specialJapanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States  U.S. and congressional leaders say. White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-see stance  after a series of meetings with former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe  who was here paving the way for the April 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.  They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit  with one senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economy and open its markets to foreign goods in the past  but it was time now for action. The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs  with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan. Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try to turn around the deficit  which has cost millions of U.S. jobs and closed thousands of factories. Much of the anger has been directed at Japan. U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by President Reagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers  television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products.  Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly  but U.S. officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan had shown it was honoring the pact  which could take several months. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater  asked if Nakasone's visit might help to defuse trade tensions  said  whether progress can be made depends on how you want to measure it.  He added   I would expect progress to be made. If you want to measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions  that's more doubtful.  Congressmen were equally skeptical. Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in trade legislation  telling them of Japan's plan to spur domestic spending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a wide range of goods  including supercomputers and farm products. Sen. John Danforth  a Missouri Republican  said after the meeting   We have heard promises in the past  but the question now is whether there will be real action.  Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill  including Congressman Richard Gephardt  a Missouri Democrat. Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations with large deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices. Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan  as well as Taiwan  South Korea  and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass the House next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but its fate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisan group of senators  however  told Nakasone in a letter released as Abe was holding Senate meetings  that fresh Japanese-U.S. trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soon opened to American goods. The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia  Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and others ranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues. They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentiment that Japan was fighting opening its markets and  evidence to the contrary is necessary to combat this perception  or it is likley that additional efforts will be attempted to close off the American market to Japanese goods."
"2","Economics Minister Martin Bangemann  whoflies to Washington this weekend for high level talks  said boosting West German economic growth would not have any significant effect on the high U.S. Current account deficit. In a paper prepared ahead of his trip  Bangemann said Bonn's trading partners had been asking whether West German growth was slowing and whether the Federal Republic should not in the future pursue more strongly expansionary policies. In the paper Bangemann wrote   It is not possible to reduce the U.S. Current account deficit by any signficant amount just through more stimulation of the West German economy.  One U.S. Administration policy maker said in Washington this week that the United States government wanted West Germany and Japan to reduce their interest rates even further to stimulate their economies. Bangemann said it was clear the high mark  as well as uncertainty about further currency developments  was making companies here cautious about production plans and investments. While West Germany did not seek exchange rates which unilaterally favoured its exports  it favoured more stability and realistic rates  which corresponded to  fundamentals.  He welcomed the February  Louvre Agreement  of six industrial nations to stabilise currencies and said   (We) expect all parties to hold by the accords struck there.  West Germany had fulfilled its pledge of boosting planned tax cuts  he noted. Despite calls for lower interest rates  Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger has hinted that central bank policy may even have to be tightened. He wrote in a newspaper article published yesterday that the Bundesbank's current accommodative stance could not continue in the long term. During his trip to Washington  which runs from April 26 to 29  Bangemann will meet Secretary of State George Shultz  trade envoy Clayton Yeutter  World Bank President Barber Conable  IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Paul Volcker  Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board."
"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe Group of Seven leading industrial nations is fully committed to halting a further decline in the dollar.  Let me emphasize that all seven major industrial nations remain fully committed to strengthening policy coordination  promoting growth and cooperating to foster stability of exchange rates   he told the American Enterprise Institute.  We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be counter productive to our efforts (to promote growth)   he said. Baker also said that after meeting Japanese special envy Shintaro Abe   it's clear that Japan intends to take strong steps to stimulate its economy to meet its committments under the Louvre Accord.  Baker said in the past two years he has worked to promote greater coordination of economic policies and important progress has been made.  Substantial exchange rate adjustments have also been accomplished over the past two years so that today we are better positioned to promote growth and reduce external imbalances   he said. Baker pointed out that in February the seven agreed to foster stable exchange rates and those commitments were renewed recently. In a speech largely devoted to discussing trade and competitiveness  Baker again warned of the dangers of protectionist trade legislation  saying it would harm the U.S. standard of living. Baker stressed adminstration trade policy sought to remove foreign barriers to trade and via forthcoming GATT talks will focus on agriculture  services and intellectual property. The Treasury Secretary said that as well as trade issues he had to focus on macroeconomic issues as well which encompass the trade picture.  The world economy today is really one constantly flowing circle of capital and goods. Trade accounts catch and measure that flow at only one spot on the circle   he said."

In addition  Baker said he was opposed to the U.S. selling a yen denominated bond arguing that such a move might send the wrong signal to markets."

Meanwhile  a Banco de Mexico spokesman confirmed that Mexican central bank head Miguel Mancera Aguayo held private talks here yesterday with the president of the Peruvian central bank. The spokesman said the talks were in line with mutual consultation agreements made during Peruvian President Alan Garcia's visit to Mexico in march. Press reports citing diplomatic sources at the meeting said the two central bank heads discussed means of coordinating actions in the silver market. Mexico is the world's leading silver produer. It produced about 73.9 mln troy ounces in 1986  according to preliminary government figures. Peru  the second biggest producer of the precious metal  earlier this week froze new silver sales in an effort to stabilize silver prices. It produced 57 mln troy ounces in 1986."
"2","The heads of the central banks of Mexicoand Peru have met in Mexico city to coordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend in the price of silver  the official newspaper El Peruano said. It said that Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa met yesterday with the president of the bank of Mexico  Miguel Mancera Aguayo. Peru  which froze new sales of refined silver and its government-marketed silver ore on tuesday  is the world's second biggest producer of the precious metal. Mexico is the largest producer. Together  the two nations account for nearly 40 pct of the world's silver output  the official paper El Peruano said. Peru adopted the move on tuesday in an bid to stablilise the price of silver bullion  which has climbed in a month from about 5.70 dlrs an ounce to over 9.00 dlrs an ounce today. After the meeting of the Peruvian and Mexican central bank heads  it was understood that Mexico might diversify the use of silver  El Peruano said. It said that Mexico and Peru did not want to speculate with the price of silver. Instead  they aimed to see that the price of the precious metal recuperated to adequate levels. El peruano did not specify what these levels were. El peruano quoted energy and mines minister Wilfredo Huayta as saying that Peru did not want to participate in speculative operations with silver. He said the government's aim was to avoid a  brutal fall  in the price of silver. Figueroa's office confirmed the Peruvian central bank president had travelled to mexico city. It was not certain if he had returned to Lima by midday today."
"2","Energy and mines minister  WilfredoHuayta  said Peru would maintain its freeze on new sales of silver until the price of the precious metal reaches  the true value this raw material should have.  He spoke to reporters at the presidential palace after meeting president Alan Garcia  whom he said recently spoke by telephone with Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid. Mexico and Peru are the world's two largest silver producers. Huayta  asked what the true price level of silver should be  repled:  well  this cannot be predicted.  He said Minero Peru Comercial (Minpeco)  the government's minerals marketing arm  would closely study the price of silver in the world market. Last Tuesday  the government instructed Minpeco  which handles all Peru's exports of refined silver and state- produced ore  to immediately freeze all new silver sales until the metal's price reached equilibrium in the world market. Peru plans to produce 63 mln ounces of silver this year  and is the largest producer of the precious metal after Mexico. Huayta said both nations' central banks would coordinate their work  but did not elaborate how they would do this. Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa and the head of Bank of Mexico  Miguel Mancera Aguayo  met in Mexico City yesterday to coordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend in the price of silver  the official newspaper El Peruano said today. Huayta said his Mexican counterpart  minister of oil  mines and parastatal industry  Alfredo del Mazo  should be in Lima on a visit at a nearby date. Huayta added Peru did not want to see great fluctuations in the price of silver  but declined to comment on what Peru would like to see as a ceiling for the precious metal's price. Silver bullion climbed to nearly 10.00 dlrs an ounce today from about 5.70 dlrs an ounce a month ago."
"2","The Peruvian government's freeze on silversales  which has contributed to a sharp boost in the metal's price  could draw retaliation by rich nations and big traders seeking lower prices  President Alan Garcia said. Peru  the world's second biggest silver producer  stopped selling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday. Since then  the metal's price has risen to its highest level in nearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounce on world markets. Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Peru could move international markets and did not have to accept cheap prices for silver  traditionally one of the top revenue earners of the country. Peru exported its refined silver last year at an average price of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago  silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce on world markets.  One thing is that Peru  which produces silver  sells it silently and in a submissive manner at the price world markets want   he told reporters at the presidential palace.  The other is that a nationalist government says  'wait a moment I can't sell silver at these prices '  he added. The peruvian energy and mines minister  Wilfredo Huayta  said the government would maintain its freeze on new sales of silver until the price of the metal reaches  the true value this raw material should have.  He did not specify this level. Garcia said rich nations and big traders  faced with Peru's stance  could try to defend themselves.  They have some stocks  they have silver deposits  they can make fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of our mineral fall in the world market   Garcia said.  Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru   he said.  Peru is in a position of action.  President Garcia had recently spoken by telephone with Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid  Huayta said. Mexico is the world's biggest producer of silver. Mexico and Peru together produce nearly nearly 40 pct of the world's silver  the official newspaper El Peruano said. The newspaper added that Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa and the head of the central bank of Mexico  Miguel Mancera Aguayo  met in Mexico City yesterday to coordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend of the price of the metal. Analysts in Zurich  a major silver trading centre  said today the rally in silver prices was also fuelled by investors buying the metal to protect themselves against inflation  which they fear could be rekindled by the dollar's weakness. On an historical basis  silver is still relatively cheap compared to gold  which some investors believe could set the stage for further rises  they said."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone wasadvised to work out a plan for his government to buy more than one billion dlrs worth of foreign industrial products as part of efforts to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States  officials said. Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone soon after returning from a U.S. Visit designed to pave the way for the prime minister's visit to Washington starting next Wednesday. Abe met President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Congressional leaders during his visit. It was not known how Nakasone responded to the suggestion. It also included increasing the nation's untied loans to developing countries to between 25 billion and 30 billion dlrs over the next three years and giving foreign firms greater access to a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan  officials said. Abe called for tax cuts and government funds to be funneled into public works projects to stimulate domestic demand. Abe spoke of the possibility that Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives."
"2","Japan s 1987 car exportrestraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough  EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq said. There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are diverting cars to the EC after the dollar s fall against the yen made their U.S. Market unprofitable  he told reporters after meeting U.S.  Japanese  and Canadian trade ministers. The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to currency movements over the past two years  it will move to prevent it  he said. Over the period  the yen has risen against the dollar almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency Unit  he said. Japan has set an unofficial  voluntary 10 pct rise in car exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its rising trade surplus with the Community  which hit a record 18 billion dlrs last year. But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales  and a seven per cent fall globally.  We think there is some diversion there   said de Clercq. Japanese officials say the overall annual rise will be only 10 pct.  But even 10 pct is 100 000 cars  whereas we sell only 40 000 cars to Japan (per year) in total   he said. The EC is also demanding that Japan ease its strict checks and requirements for imported cars  which Brussels says is a non-tariff barrier. The EC is also worried because EC demand for cars is falling this year  making any rise in Japanese imports even more serious for EC auto manufacturers. De Clercq  who has taken a hard line on world trade problems at this weekend meeting in central Japan  said the EC appreciated Japan s plans to cut exports and lift domestic growth instead.  But even if all these measures are implemented  it will take time. But there is not time   he said.  There are burning issues on the table which cannot wait. It were better that the fire were put out immediately and not to wait till the house burns down   he said."
"2","New York Federal Reserve BankPresident Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the value of the dollar but refused to say whether U.S. Interest rates would be raised to protect the currency.  A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen at this juncture I would regard as counterproductive   he told a news conference. His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  who also warned against a further dollar fall. The U.S. Currency plunged to a post-war low below 140 yen last week  despite dollar-buying by a number of central banks. Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a further dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S. Trade deficit  dealers said. The only thing likely to help the dollar is seen as a rise in U.S. Interest rates. Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. Was ready to risk damaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates. The dollar s sharp drop this month has also raised questions about the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven. But Corrigan said:  They have played a constructive role in so far as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree of economic policy coordination."
"2","President Reagan warned the U.S.Congress in his weekly radio address against passing what he called dangerous  protectionist trade legislation that would tie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other countries. Reagan  who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone here this week  said he would lift tariffs imposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as Tokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors. U.S. Officials gave the same message to former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington last week. In his weekly radio address on Saturday  Reagan said he would tell Nakasone:  We want to continue to work cooperatively on trade problems and want very much to lift these trade restrictions as soon as evidence permits. Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade retaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his staunch anti-protectionist policies.  In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with a particular problem  not begin a trade war   he said. But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit  which has cost millions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories. A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman Richard Gephardt is expected to come during Nakasone s visit. It would penalise nations with large trade surpluses and which are alleged to use unfair trade practices. Reagan warned Congress that such action would undercut his ability to negotiate on trade issues with Nakasone and others.  With my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Venice economic summit coming up  it s terribly important not to restrict a president s options in such trade dealings with foreign governments   he said.  Unfortunately  some in the Congress are trying to do exactly that   he said. Reagan said he would keep the American people  informed on this dangerous legislation because it s just another form of protectionism and I may need your help to stop it."
"2","Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action.  Until today we have anounced policies  but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody   Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.  From now on  if a government comes up with a certain policy  it must be followed by action   he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States  the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week  the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen  despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade.  We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence  then we can have an impact   said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general  it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets.  The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club  you have to act in concord with the rules  if you want to be credible   said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed:  We are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face.  She said that next month s meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later.  The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued   he said.  What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way   he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others  positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions  he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential  but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year  an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986  and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion  he said. Trade retaliation  protectionism  and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous  he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal  monetary  trade and industrial measures  and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules  he said. In this regard  the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened  he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy."
"2","Plans for a new-style EuropeanCommunity (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive their first full review from EC foreign ministers today  but are unlikely to gather much support. Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget payments by bringing member states  contributions more into line with national wealth. They said the EC s current paymasters  Britain  France  and West Germany  would lead the opposition to the plans  designed to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s. Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five billion dlrs  EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system. Such action was necessary  he argued  to end a damaging cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological research programs and regional and social spending projects. Ironically  diplomats said  the move could spark exactly the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members. Delors  plans  by linking a country s contributions to its Gross National Product (GNP)  would over the next five years add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion. Currently  contributions are calculated on a percentage of Value Added Tax (VAT) returns. Under the new scheme  all countries would pay one pct of their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a country s total VAT receipts and its GNP. London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to the scheme  arguing instead that money should be made available from deep cutbacks in the EC s heavily-subsidised farm sector. Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the wearisome budget wrangling  taking the line that the highly diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when forced to do so. The issue is further complicated by a possible general election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of the way."
"2","Japan's Jiji Press quoted Bank of JapanGovernor Satoshi Sumita as telling Japanese reporters the central bank will continue determined market intervention to prevent a further rise in the value of the yen. Sumita  who is attending an annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank  also said he does not think the yen will continue to rise  Jiji reported. He said the Bank of Japan is keeping close contact with other major industrial nations on concerted market intervention  Jiji said. He said coordinated intervention is the only way to stop the dollar from dropping too fast  Jiji said. The dollar fell below 138 yen today."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawatold a press conference the basic solution to currency instability among major nations is economic policy coordination. He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination does not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage.  That is democracy   he said. Upon that foundation  Miyazawa said  there must be coordinated intervention. Major nations have sufficient funds to continue concerted intervention  he added.  Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will continue to operate   Miyazawa said. Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and U.S. President Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre and Washington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currency stability when they meet later this week. Asked whether the dollar is declining against all major currencies  not only the yen  Miyazawa declined to make any comments. He reiterated that many major nations have undertaken coordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar  including countries who are not members of the G-7."
"2","President Reagan is expected to tellPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June  the New York Times said. The newspaper  quoting administration officials  said that under such a scenario the President would announce just before the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of the month. Japan  for its part  would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan for U.S. Chip producers. The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets  motorised tools and personal computers on April 17. Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the immediate lifting of the tariffs. But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against Japanese trade policies  the end-of-June timeframe is seen as the best Reagan can offer  the Times said. It said some verbal formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would allow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory."
"2","The Philippines has received a 300mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank  Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters. Ongpin said the loan  carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year  matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the World Bank in March. Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed. Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and 80 billion yen. The aid package  originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87 fiscal year ended March  was delayed because of the Philippines' change of government last year.  The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49 billion yen   he said.  But they are likely to bring it up to that level for the 15th package.  Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the 14th yen package.  We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of untied commodity loans   he said. Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft loans to finance a land reform program  for which Japan is expected to supply most of the financing  had been put off until next month because of delays in preparatory work. Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here. Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed leader Ferdinand Marcos.  But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the field of lending to the private sector   he said. The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower after Pakistan in 1986  with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs. Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in 1987 to reach the same level.  They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we want. But we have to come up with the projects   he said."

"2","The Reagan Administration isconsidering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore 100 000 jobs  U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said. A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a package to bring 1 000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raise domestic production by one mln barrels a day  he said. The tax status of exploration might also be changed  Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times internationally and had been devastated in the United States. Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln barrels a day in over the last 16 months  Herrington said.  Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our energy security   he said. The administration is committed to improving marketplace conditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.  This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions  like an oil import fee  which are bad for the United States and bad for the world   he added."

We cannot expect currency stability only through coordinated market intervention   he said. Miyazawa also told the committee the U.S. Has not called on Japan to cut its 2.5 pct discount rate. Miyazawa said the government is not considering investing in U.S. Government bonds to help stabilize exchange rates. This matter has to be dealt with carefully because it involves the public's money and exchange rates are moving widely  he added. The ministry will consider where to invest its funds when exchange rates become stable  he said. Asked if Japan is considering a request to the U.S. For it to raise its discount rate to stabilize exchange rates  Miyazawa said the U.S. Has not been able to take action now because it has to maintain its economic growth."
"2","Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided tokeep Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in office for a further eight years  the news magazine Der Spiegel said. Government officials were not immediately available to comment on the report  which said that because Poehl is a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD)  Kohl had not taken the decision lightly. Poehl has been Bundesbank chief since January 1  1980  while Kohl's conservative/liberal coalition has held power since 1982. Der Spiegel said Kohl would have preferred to offer the post to a member of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But the magazine noted Poehl enjoyed a good international reputation. Officials have often said Poehl and CDU Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg hold each other in high regard. Poehl's current term expires at the end of this year. Officials have said no date has been set for an announcement on whether his tenure will be extended. Poehl was made an economic adviser to SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1971. A year later he was appointed State Secretary at the Finance Ministry when former SPD Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was Finance Minister. There has recently been press speculation that the Bundesbank presidency may be offered to Poehl's deputy  Helmut Schlesinger  a conservative monetarist. According to these reports  Schlesinger would be replaced two years later by CDU member Hans Tietmeyer  the current Finance Ministry State Secretary. Also under discussion as president was Johann Wilhelm Gaddum  a member of the Bundesbank board and a CDU member who is known to be close to Kohl."
"2","Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of the year  Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand have been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half of the year  prices will tend to increase  because non-OPEC producers have not been able to produce more oil at current prices  he said. But he declined to predict  when asked after the meeting  whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over the last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day  or two mln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries  particularly the U.S. And Canada  is expected to decrease this year  but some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in Cameroon  India and other developing countries  he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the upper hand in world oil markets  Subroto said in an earlier speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.  If OPEC emerges the winner  than it can gradually resume its former role in world oil markets   he said.  But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30 dlrs a barrel  at least not in the next three or four years   Subroto said."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said hehopes his visit to Washington later this week will help resolve Japan's severe trade problems with the United States. Nakasone leaves on his sixth official visit to the United States on Wednesday  only weeks after President Reagan imposed punitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronic goods for alleged violation of a semiconductor pact. Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in the U.S. Congress for further action to help improve trade imbalances. Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached a record 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986. Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe  who has just returned from Washington  told him protectionist sentiment in the United States is severe.  We are well aware of a movement in the United States to enact legislation   Nakasone said. He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not to go to the United States but it is now more important than ever that he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the views of the United States.  My visit to the United States at this time will be the most important visit of all   Nakasone said. While in Washington  he said he hopes to have candid and frank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionl leaders. He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability  economic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Soviet disarmament and arms control. On the recently imposed trade sactions  Nakasone said he would present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports are increasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to third countries.  We have full confidence we can present clear evidence   he said.  (Therefore)  we will request that the sanctions be lifted at the earliest possible time.  On the trade imbalance  Nakasone said Japan has already taken action. The volume of exports to the United States has been cut  while U.S. Imports have increased. But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nations have recently surged  those from the United States remain weak  indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness  he said. Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve the trade imbalance but the United States will have to become more competitive and improve its huge budget deficit. He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summit of the seven major industrial nations in June.  We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace  disarmament and the world economies as a whole through solidarity   Nakasone said."

"2","Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa opened the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank by holding out the promise of more Japanese money for the organisation.  We are ... Striving to enhance the flow of capital from Japan to the developing countries   he said.  The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern for us in our bilateral and multilateral assistance.  He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a special Japanese fund at the ADB  like the one at the World Bank. The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developing countries. Developing countries and the United States have criticised Japan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poor countries. Later this week  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is expected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend as much as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the next three years  Japanese officials said. The exta ADB funding would be part of that amount.  Our cooperation is intended to contibute to ... Alleviating the burden on (developing countries)   said Miyazawa  who is also chairman of the ADB board of governors.  The developing countries today find themselves in a very difficult situation   he said.  With a few notable exceptions  those countries that are highly dependent upon commodity exports face a rough road ahead.  While the developing countries can help themselves by striving to become internationally competitive and seeking to attract foreign investment  the ADB also has a role to play  he said. Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up its economic advice program to developing nations and must work vigorously to identify development projects for loans. He also called for more use of loans that were not tied to development projects  but provided more overall help to the borrower. ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view.  The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor   Fujioka said.  The bank will now have to equip itself to meet a range of services required to attend to varied needs of its developing members.  Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow its Export-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans. These would not have to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment. Tokyo was also prepared to let the Asian Development Bank raise more funds in Tokyo and financial markets should it need to do so  he said."

Miyazawa said the government is not considering investing in U.S. Government bonds to help stabilize exchange rates. This matter has to be dealt with carefully because it involves the public's money and exchange rates are moving widely  he added. The ministry will consider where to invest its funds when exchange rates become stable  he said. Asked if Japan is considering a request to the U.S. For it to raise its discount rate to stabilize exchange rates  Miyazawa said the U.S. Has not been able to take action now because it has to maintain its economic growth."
"2","New York Federal Reserve BankPresident Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the value of the dollar but refused to say whether U.S. interest rates would be raised to protect the currency.  A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen at this juncture I would regard as counterproductive   he told a news conference. His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  who also warned against a further dollar fall. Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a further dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit  dealers said  adding the only thing likely to help the dollar is seen as a rise in U.S. Interest rates. Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. was ready to risk damaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates. The dollar's sharp drop this month has also raised questions about the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven. But Corrigan said:  They have played a constructive role in so far as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree of economic policy coordination."
"2","President Reagan warned the U.S.Congress in his weekly radio address against passing what he called dangerous  protectionist trade legislation that would tie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other countries. Reagan  who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone here this week  said he would lift tariffs imposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as Tokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors. U.S. officials gave the same message to former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in talks here last week. In his weekly radio address on Saturday  Reagan said he would tell Nakasone:  We want to continue to work cooperatively on trade problems and want very much to lift these trade restrictions as soon as evidence permits. Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade retaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his staunch anti-protectionist policies.  In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with a particular problem  not begin a trade war   he said."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawatold a press conference the basic solution to currency instability among major nations is economic policy coordination. He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination does not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage.  That is democracy   he said. Upon that foundation  Miyazawa said  there must be coordinated intervention. Major nations have sufficient funds to continue concerted intervention  he added.  Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will continue to operate   Miyazawa said. Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and U.S. President Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre and Washington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currency stability when they meet later this week. Asked whether the dollar is declining against all major currencies  not only the yen  Miyazawa declined to make any comments. He reiterated that many major nations have undertaken coordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar  including countries who are not members of the G-7."
"2","The Philippines has received a 300mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank  Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters. Ongpin said the loan  carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year  matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the World Bank in March. Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed. Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and 80 billion yen. The aid package  originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87 fiscal year ended March  was delayed because of the Philippines' change of government last year.  The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49 billion yen   he said.  But they are likely to bring it up to that level for the 15th package.  Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the 14th yen package.  We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of untied commodity loans   he said. Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft loans to finance a land reform program  for which Japan is expected to supply most of the financing  had been put off until next month because of delays in preparatory work. Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here. Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed leader Ferdinand Marcos.  But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the field of lending to the private sector   he said. The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower after Pakistan in 1986  with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs. Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in 1987 to reach the same level.  They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we want. But we have to come up with the projects   he said."
"2","Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided tokeep Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in office for a further eight years  the news magazine Der Spiegel said. Government officials were not immediately available to comment on the report  which said that because Poehl is a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD)  Kohl had not taken the decision lightly. Poehl has been Bundesbank chief since January 1  1980  while Kohl's conservative/liberal coalition has held power since 1982. Der Spiegel said Kohl would have preferred to offer the post to a member of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But the magazine noted Poehl enjoyed a good international reputation. Officials have often said Poehl and CDU Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg hold each other in high regard. Poehl's current term expires at the end of this year. Officials have said no date has been set for an announcement on whether his tenure will be extended. Poehl was made an economic adviser to SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1971. A year later he was appointed State Secretary at the Finance Ministry when former SPD Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was Finance Minister. There has recently been press speculation that the Bundesbank presidency may be offered to Poehl's deputy  Helmut Schlesinger  a conservative monetarist. According to these reports  Schlesinger would be replaced two years later by CDU member Hans Tietmeyer  the current Finance Ministry State Secretary. Also under discussion as president was Johann Wilhelm Gaddum  a member of the Bundesbank board and a CDU member who is known to be close to Kohl."
"2","President Reagan is expected to tellPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June  the New York Times said. The newspaper  quoting administration officials  said that under such a scenario the President would announce just before the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of the month. Japan  for its part  would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan for U.S. Chip producers. The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets  motorised tools and personal computers on April 17. Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the immediate lifting of the tariffs. But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against Japanese trade policies  the end-of-June timeframe is seen as the best Reagan can offer  the Times said. It said some verbal formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would allow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory."
"2","The U.S. warned its majortrade partners that its trade deficit must fall by September or a protectionist trade bill from Congress would be highly likely. Meanwhile  European Community (EC) external trade chief Willy de Clercq said that if Japan's trade surplus  which hit almost 90 billion dlrs last year  continued so high  there would be stormy weather ahead. U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter told trade leaders from Japan  the EC and Canada that there was at least a 50-50 chance that a protectionist bill reaching the House of Representatives this week would pass the Senate in September. The U.S. economy badly needed better trade figures by then  or President Ronald Reagan would have a difficult time vetoing such a bill  he said  according to a series of briefings to reporters by official delegates at the weekend meeting. A 15 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit in March had only incensed Congress further  he said."
"2","Japan's 1987 car exportrestraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough  EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq said. There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are diverting cars to the EC after the dollar's fall against the yen made their U.S. market unprofitable  he told reporters after meeting U.S.  Japanese  and Canadian trade ministers. The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to currency movements over the past two years  it will move to prevent it  he said. Over the period  the yen has risen against the dollar almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency Unit  he said. Japan has set an unofficial  voluntary 10 pct rise in car exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its rising trade surplus with the Community  which hit a record 18 billion dlrs last year. But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales  and a seven per cent fall globally.  We think there is some diversion there   said de Clercq."
"2","Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of the year  Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand have been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half of the year  prices will tend to increase  because non-OPEC producers have not been able to produce more oil at current prices  he said. But he declined to predict  when asked after the meeting  whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over the last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day  or two mln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries  particularly the U.S. And Canada  is expected to decrease this year  but some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in Cameroon  India and other developing countries  he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the upper hand in world oil markets  Subroto said in an earlier speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.  If OPEC emerges the winner  than it can gradually resume its former role in world oil markets   he said.  But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30 dlrs a barrel  at least not in the next three or four years   Subroto said."

Earlier this month in Washington  finance ministers of the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  France  Italy  Britain and Canada reaffirmed an earlier Paris accord to arrest the dollar's fall.

In an earlier speech before the Milan Chamber of Commerce  the minister said European countries have to seek  a better consensus of economic and monetary policies.

"2","Treasury Secretary James Baker hascancelled a trip to Australia because of pressing business at home  including the visit this week by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman  who asked not to be identified  said:  I would not draw any conclusion from the cancellation...I would just say it's the press of business.  But he added that the visit by the Japanese leader was  part of the press of business.  The spokesman denied the cancellation was linked to the current turmoil in the financial markets.  Nakasone's visit is expected to be crucial for the currency markets. Unless the Japanese prime minister brings with him measures to stimulate the Japanese economy by fiscal expansion or lower interest rates  the visit is likely to be considered by currency markets as an outright failure. In addition  it is thought highly unlikely that Nakasone and Reagan will agree on the removal of U.S. trade sanctions imposed earlier this month on certain electronic goods. But the participation in the talks by Baker  the administration's top policy maker on international economic affairs  suggests that hard bargaining between the two sides may be in prospect.  Asked if the trip by Baker  who was to have left April 30 and returned May 6  had been dropped in the last couple of days  the Treasury spokesman replied:  I would think so.  He described the trip as  purely ceremonial.  Both Japan and the United States have a lot to lose from an unsuccessful outcome to the this week's talks. Tokyo and Washington are aware that nervous currency markets stand ready to bail out of dollars and buy yen  which economists fear could send world interest rates soaring and even lead to global recession. Baker has been the driving force behind the administration's efforts to coordinate international economic policies and reduce global trade imbalances."
"2","The Reagan Administration isconsidering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore 100 000 jobs  U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said. A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a package to bring 1 000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raise domestic production by one mln barrels a day  he said. The tax status of exploration might also be changed  Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times internationally and had been devastated in the United States. Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln barrels a day in over the last 16 months  Herrington said.  Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our energy security   he said. The administration is committed to improving marketplace conditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.  This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions  like an oil import fee  which are bad for the United States and bad for the world   he added."

"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone wasadvised to work out a plan for his government to buy more than one billion dlrs worth of foreign industrial products as part of efforts to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States  officials said. Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone soon after returning from a U.S. Visit designed to pave the way for the prime minister's visit to Washington starting next Wednesday. Abe met President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Congressional leaders during his visit. It was not known how Nakasone responded to the suggestion. It also included increasing the nation's untied loans to developing countries to between 25 billion and 30 billion dlrs over the next three years and giving foreign firms greater access to a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan  officials said. Abe called for tax cuts and government funds to be funneled into public works projects to stimulate domestic demand. Abe spoke of the possibility that Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone beleaguered by political turmoil at home  sets out Wednesday on a tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the most serious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory. Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone  scheduled for Thursday and Friday  come on the heels of the imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanese goods for the first time since World War Two. In the past  bilateral trade friction involving cotton goods  steel  television sets  textiles and cars have ended with Japan taking on voluntary export curbs. Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives. A proposed amendment to the bill  drafted by Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri  will mandate a 10 pct annual reduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nations which have large trade gaps with the United States. The United States last year had a record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recently he was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks between the two leaders. Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back and forth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone's visit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event will be in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari. Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory body led by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa. Japan plans to spend over 5 000 billion yen to boost domestic demand  increase imports of U.S. products including supercomputers and give more help to developing countries  government officials said. The government has been making last ditch efforts in time for Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues  officials said. The issues include foreign access to a new Japanese overseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan. Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromise accord with opposition parties over a controversial sales tax plan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower House of a government draft budget for 1987/88. The accord  offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara  virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan  but left room for future tax reform plans  political analysts said. Nakasone  who led his party to a resounding electoral triumph last July  saw his popularity drop because of the sales tax. His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-election and nationwide local elections in the past two months. Mitsuru Uchida  professor of political science at Waseda University  told Reuters:  I doubt that whatever Nakasone does in Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would help restore his weakened power-base at home.  Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after the Venice summit of industrialized nations in June."
"2","Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action.  Until today we have anounced policies  but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody   Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.  From now on  if a government comes up with a certain policy  it must be followed by action   he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States  the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week  the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen  despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade.  We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence  then we can have an impact   said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general  it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets.  The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club  you have to act in concord with the rules  if you want to be credible   said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Pat Carney of Canada said  We are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face.  She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later.  The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued   he said.  What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way   he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others' positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions  he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential  but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year  an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986  and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion  he said. Trade retaliation  protectionism  and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous  he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal  monetary  trade and industrial measures  and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules  he said. In this regard  the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened  he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy."

Byrd  a Democrat  said he agrees but said others may want amendments.

"2","President Reagan said he hoped theUnited States could lift trade sanctions against Japan soon. But he said the United States would do what is necessary to see that other nations lived up to their trade agreements. In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  he said   I hope that  before long  we can lift these (Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will be recorded as a small incident in the building of our relationship.  But  Reagan added   we will do what is necessary to see that other nations live up to their obligations and trading agreements with us. Trade must be free. It must also be fair.  Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States sent a message it was time to complete a U.S.-Japan  trade bridge.   The final answer to the trade problems between America and Japan is not more hemming and hawing  not more trade sanctions  not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may be needed as steps along the way - and certainly not more unfulfilled agreements   he said. Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open markets on both sides of the Pacific -  and the sooner  the better.  Reagan said the administration's tools for dealing with unfair trade practices met the need for both firmness and finesse. He said trade legislation pending in Congress would be dangerous because it would force the administration to use  a steamroller against unfair practices every time  no matter whether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flatten the entire house   he said. Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice in Japan would cut the U.S. trade deficit by only about 10 pct.  If our trade deficit is to come down  more must be done -- and is being done   he said.  The change in the dollar's value is part of it  and since the middle of last year  the actual volume of our exports had been on the rise   he said. He also said he believed America's trading partners should cut taxes and regulations  as the United States had done  so that they could create jobs and buy more goods."
"2","The Reagan administration is expected toface tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched U.S. interests  if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beef and citrus import controls by April  1988  U.S. and Japanese officials said. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus in talks here last week  insisting that the quotas be abandoned by April  1988. But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japan will resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S. suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintaining the quotas  U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters. Twice in the past  the United States has negotiated with Japan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978  and in bilateral talks in 1984. Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at the outset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead. The current agreement calls for an increase in high quality beef imports to 58 400 tonnes in fiscal 1987  oranges to 126 000 tonnes and orange juice to 8 500 tonnes. Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United States will not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan has been given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support system and the quotas must be scrapped  Lyng said. Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and citrus in August or September in Hawaii  sources said. If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance  and Japan  as expected rejects the demands  the issue may then be put to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement  which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April  1988 deadline set by the U.S.  officials said. In interviews here  Japanese officials insist that on beef they will not liberalize imports  regardless of the U.S. pressure  because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive and would be damaged by freer trade. Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small farms which Japanese officials said must be protected from cheap imports by use of the quota system. Furthermore  while the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association is strongly supporting the tough administration position  some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent. This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beef exports to Japan under the quota system are a steady  reliable business managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan's beef market has expanded at the expense of Australia. In the absence of quotas  some U.S. suppliers are concerned the U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan would become a riskier business  meat industry sources said. Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washington next week  including cattlemen  processors and exporters  in an effort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan. The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue. California's Sunkist  the largest U.S. supplier of oranges to Japan  has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas. A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is concerned that in the absence of quotas  lower quality oranges from Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan. Ironically  some Japanese officials hinted that fresh oranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a minimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production. This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete with smaller Japanese mandarins  officials said. But Japan wants to maintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juice tastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orange juice  they said. One scenario mentioned by both U.S. and Japanese officials is that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stance by offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return for U.S. acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas. Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef and citrus imports is a difficult objective  but he insisted during the week-long tour here that it is a high priority on the U.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the rice issue which received most of the attention. Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness  Lyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese side have benefited from quotas but this will not stop the administration from pressing for liberalization. And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshall more support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before  because of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus.  We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation) with a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The times have changed. The trade balance is much worse   Lyng said."
"2","The prospect of renewed assaults onthe dollar might force the United States eventually to unveil distasteful measures to bolster support for its currency  monetary analysts and economists said. Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that the Reagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing yen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar. But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to take such an unusual step. Nonetheless  monetary sources say the issue has been seriously discussed by the administration.  It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now   Baker said last week.  In our view there might well be some who would view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as  in fact  a lack of confidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore we don't think it's an appropriate thing to do.  But if the Reagan administration did announce measures  they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort to end the instability in financial markets with genuine action to reduce massive economic imbalances  monetary analysts believe. And  like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carter administration  issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a rise in the discount rate  now 5.5 pct. The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key rate so far  chiefly  some Fed officials say  because it could hurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragile international debt situation. Analysts who expect a currency support package are divided over its possible timing. Some even believe an announcement could come this week during a visit to Washington by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.  It would give some real focus to the visit  and it might steady the dollar and prevent it from going down   said Charles Taylor  an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the Reagan administration would resort to measures which would bring to mind the troubles of President Carter. Until very recently  the current administration has urged a lower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while Carter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic policies collapsed. But today  Washington's policies are increasingly in question. The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1  1978. And it was a resounding success.  This package really gave credibility to the administration to get the dollar up   said Robert Hormats  vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S. economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations. The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around 188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen.  The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is evidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really doing very little   Hormats said of statements to support the dollar by U.S. officials. Several currency traders and foreign central bank officials think these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying the dollar has declined far enough. Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc bonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support for the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors  who had lost confidence in the dollar  to U.S. government notes. The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount rate  to 9.5 pct  drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at the International Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS to other IMF members. It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lines with other central banks and stepped up official U.S. gold sales. Stephen Axilrod  a former Fed official who is now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities  said   I think it's very unlikely they would do that now.  He argued that it was politically difficult to take action to support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have still to fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies. But most analysts believe a currency support package would only work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade imbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers. It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders of the seven major industrial democracies -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  Britain  France  Italy and Canada. Hormats said he believed the currency has to decline slightly further for a package to have impact. He said the seven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forged too soon to fundamentally change market sentiment.  I think we're nearing a point when they would feel (politically) comfortable doing this   Hormats said. Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to act firmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the pressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear of fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress. But Hormats said  there will be a point at which the government of the United States shows it does give a damn for the dollar."
"2","European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker  who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings  were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday  they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct  and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores  to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins  and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds  a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers  all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions  maintained entrenched positions yesterday  making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in a notional common currency  are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area  saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which  while not having the status of a compromise proposal  would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle  with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns  and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically  is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for."
"2","China is likely to borrow up to300 mln dlrs this year from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  president Masao Fujioka said. The loans would be China's first from the ADB.  I think there will be at least one loan to China this year  and possibly a second   Fujioka told a news conference at the end of the ADB's annual meeting here. Asked how large the loans were likely to be  Fujioka said he thought they would range from 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs each. China is the ADB's newest member  joining in March 1986. China is the third-largest shareholder after Japan and the U.S.. It was elected to the ADB's 12-member board yesterday. Fujioka announced that the ADB's 1989 meeting would be held in Peking. The 1988 meeting will be held in Manila. Fujioka said the ADB would consider delegates' suggestions that it set up a task force of experts to define its future role. The ADB's performance was criticised by both its rich and poor members at the three-day meeting just finished. External experts had carried out a study on ADB policy for the 1980s  Fujioka said. He said a similar study for the 1990s would be useful  but the ADB had no fixed ideas yet. He said the ADB had already responded to members like the U.S.  Which urged it to improve analysis of funded projects.  We had already decided that the ADB should strengthen its research capability   Fujioka said. He said ADB lending had declined  but  the amount is not the only thing that counts. We also want to be a catalyst by taking innovative measures like the promotion of the private sector.  Fujioka also talked of the struggle between the U.S. And Japan over their voting power in the ADB. Total Japanese contributions to the ADB are higher than those of the U.S.  So Japanese delegates asked for their voting power to reflect this. The U.S. Opposed the move.  It is advisable and wise  for institutions like the ADB to be viable  that there be a reasonable relationship between financial contributions and voting power   Fujioka said. But he indicated the problem remained unresolved. Asked if the ADB would respond to a plea by Vietnam to resume lending which was cut off in 1974  Fujioka re-iterated his view that conditions there were not conducive to banking. Fujioka declined to elaborate on Vietnam  but said there had been no pressure from the U.S. Or any other country on the issue. He also spoke about demands by the bank's financiers that it take a more active role in prodding borrowers into making economic policy changes.  The initiative must come from the borrowing country. We don't accept that we impose policy conditions. There must be a two-way consultation   he said."
"2","The U.K. Economy looks stronger than itdid only last month  when the government unveiled its budget for fiscal 1987/88  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He told Parliament that  all the indicators that have been published since the budget confirm that  if anything  we are doing even better than I suggested then.  The budget was unveiled on March 17.  The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation  too  is lower than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance of payments is also performing better  so far  than I predicted.  The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0 billion stg. It was in fact lower  at 3.3 billion stg. He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987 of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said  output appears to be rising  if anything  rather faster.  Speaking during a House of Commons debate  he said   by the end of this year we will have registered the longest period of steady growth  at close to 3.0 pct a year  that the British economy has known since the (Second World) War.  The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic rate of taxation by two pence  to 27 pence in the pound. Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to further cut the standard rate to  no more than 25p.  He said that that objective  should not take too long to achieve.  Turning to policies proposed by political opposition parties  Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg. That  he said   would require either a doubling of the basic rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of (valued added tax) VAT   which is currently 15 pct. On value added tax  Lawson noted that the Conservative government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.  Beyond that  the incidence of taxation has to be determined in the light of the budgetary needs at the time  and no responsible government could conceivably take any other position   he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods. Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation can often produce higher  not lower  revenues   thus leading to the scope for still further reductions in taxation.  Lawson said  inheritance tax is expected this year to yield almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80 pct higher in real terms  and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct.  He said that  the greatly increased yield of Corporation Tax  reflecting greatly increased company profitability  is clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I introduced in 1984  which brought the rate of tax on company profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised world."
"2","President Reagan said a furtherdecline in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive. In written answers to questions put by Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper  he noted Treasury Secretary James Baker had said all seven major industrial nations were committed to cooperating in fostering stability of exchange rates.  We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be counterproductive   Reagan said. Reagan said the best way for the United States to reduce its trade deficit was to export more. He said Japan could make a major contribution to reducing external imbalances and sustaining world economic growth by adopting policies to promote stronger domestic demand in the short-run and  in the long-run  implementing structural reforms to ease Japanese dependence on exports as a source of growth."
"2","West Germany will stand firm at next week'seconomic summit in Venice against foreign pressure to follow Japan's example of a multi-billion dlr package to stimulate the economy  West German officials said. They conceded Japan's announcement last week of a 6 000 billion yen plan to bolster its economy would throw the spotlight back on West Germany  which would face redoubled calls from its partners to stimulate sluggish growth. (See ECRA page for latest Economic Spotlights) This view has already been voiced in Washington  where officials spoke at the weekend of behind-the-scenes consultations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl with the aim of securing a quick pledge to take action on the economy. Italy's central bank governor Carlo Ciampi has also criticized West Germany's reluctance  to utilize its economic potential  for expansionary policies. But West German officials said it was virtually inconceivable that Kohl would make any concessions in Venice despite a sharp economic downswing at the start of this year.  There is just no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves   said one official  echoing statements by both Kohl and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. Stoltenberg already has problems finding the cash to finance a series of tax cuts promised for 1990  and has said his budget is now stretched to the limit. He is reluctantly letting government borrowing rise while federal income falls as a result of the tax cuts  which he hopes will stimulate growth and satisfy foreign critics.  West Germany is exhausting to the furthest possible limit its fiscal scope as far as growth and employment is concerned   Stoltenberg said last month. But U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said Europeans and the U.S. Were worried by flagging German growth.  We and others are concerned about the continued signs of weakness in the German economy   he said. Other U.S. Officials said France shared these worries. Kohl will go to Venice only days after the publication of figures expected to show that the West German economy actually contracted in the first three months of 1987. West Germany has pledged to review possible measures should further growth be endangered  but officials say they do not expect such a review to be necessary. Bonn says the economy rebounded in the second quarter and it predicts growth of just under two pct for the year. West Germany's trading partners are also likely to wait in in vain for any further pump-priming from the Bundesbank. Bundesbank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger made clear today the bank would keep interest rates down  but said there were no plans for a cut in the Bundesbank's key discount rate  which  at three pct  is near historical lows. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also spoke over the weekend of the need for all countries to play a role on the international economic scene.  We have to recognise that there are also limits to economic growth in a country like Germany   he said. This stance was taken by Kohl when he outlined expectations for the Venice summit in an interview last week. Referring to West Germany's program of tax cuts and its low interest rates  he said   With these policies we have made a significant contribution to growth and to a balanced development of the world economy.  Kohl expected no new initiatives from Venice  though he reckoned on confirmation of agreed policies  such as a pact made in Paris in February which sought to stabilize the dollar. That pact involved a pledge from the United States and Japan  respectively to cut the massive American budget deficit and to stimulate Japanese demand. Kohl said he would remind both Washington and Tokyo of those promises."
"2","The White House said President Reaganhad made no decision on whether to reappoint Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when Volcker's term expires in August.  No decision has been made on chairman Volcker ... He has not discussed this with the president  and no decision has been made one way or another   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. Asked if Reagan would discuss the issue with Volcker before leaving for the Venice summit on Wednesday  Fitzwater said   I have no idea."
"2","Norway is expected to seek a compromisesolution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm will operate the Heidrun oil field  government sources said. The sources  who asked not to be named  said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field's operator through the development phase  with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s. Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved. It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies  the sources added. This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that  if approved by the government  would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator  a move sharply criticised by Conoco. Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway."
"2","A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect  although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves. Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German  might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month  the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force  just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings. Given a strong guilder  a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff  forcing an official Dutch rate cut  analysts said. In February  when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct  the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then  however  both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April  Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut  and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct  the lowest since 1965. Technically  analysts said  there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota  and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks. Today  foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix  a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands  dealers said. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However  he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term. In the Netherlands  the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil  or even negative  while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth.  It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation   the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth  which ran at 3.4 pct in January  could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank  a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates  currently averaging around 6.1 pct  to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct. Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down  probably only temporarily  while money rates could fall below five pct. Currently  all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in the money market."

After six weeks of public wrangling over the so-called  double-zero  offer  Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition finally said it would agree to an East-West ban on shorter-range nuclear missiles. But in a statement issued after top-level talks  the government said Bonn wanted the 72 West German Pershing-1a missiles excluded from an East-West accord -- a demand diplomats said could produce a snag in the Geneva arms talks."

"2","President Reagan said he would discussthe Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in preserving free navigation. In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack  Reagan said the American people were aware that  it is not our interests alone that are being protected.  Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret  Reagan declared   During the upcoming summit in Venice  we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.  The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower before such challenges  and they should not expect to stand alone.  Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain  France  West Germany  Italy  Canada and Japan at the economic summit  which will take place in Venice June 8-10.  The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more. These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.  They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom  deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests   Reagan said.  In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan  Reagan  who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts  also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.  While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion  preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community   he said.   It will be made clear  especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany  that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend.  Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability.  Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten   he said.  The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action."
"2","Japan was ready to use diplomacy to helpmaintain the security of the Gulf  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said. But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and Iraq  which have been at war since September 1980. Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's crude oil passes through the waterway. President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda for next week's G-7 summit in Venice. Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help maintain freedom of navigation. Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington understands this problem."
"2","The Philippines' first quarter growthfigures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets  Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview. The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier.  I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short   Fernandez said. NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP growth  put earlier at 0.13 pct  was revised to 1.51 pct.  Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block   Fernandez said.  I think even before the figures came out  simply looking at key indicators  such as consumption of fuel oil and power  showed that the economy was on a different track from last year   he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather  and it could drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector  which grew by 9.64 pct  after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.  That is not a seasonal thing  it is secular   he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23  1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.  It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line   he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled  Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills  introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity  had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates  started in October last year  had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills  whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20  were going well.  Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool   he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said   I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.  The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter  while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso  currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar  ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more competitive.  By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country's trading partners   he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code  he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code  scheduled for last January  has been delayed by objections from some business groups.  I think any central bank  certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years  has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I'm not about to do that   Fernandez said.  It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free   he said.  We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts."
"2","Belgium's public debt rose in April by anominal 38.5 billion francs to 5 719.4 billion francs. This follows a rise of 89.8 billion in March and a rise of 11.2 billion in April 1986  Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said. He said in his monthly statement that after taking account of foreign exchange variations and other factors the figure corresponding to the government's net financing requirement in April was 34.9 billion francs against 24 billion in April 1986. In the first four months of this year public debt rose 301.1 billion francs against 269.7 billion in the same period of 1986  the statement said. Between January and April the figure corresponding to the net financing requirement was 286.3 billion francs compared with 293.1 billion in the same period in 1986. The government has started an austerity programme designed to cut spending this year by 195 billion francs and to cut the net financing requirement to below 420 billion francs compared with 561 billion in 1986."
"2","For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl isthe scourge of speculators  for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years  and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent West German central bank  the Bundesbank  Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year  government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights  see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made  raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats  now in opposition  before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl  the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States  enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances  Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt  and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister  bankers said. It was Schmidt who  as Chancellor  appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months  with the mark's strong rise against the dollar  Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council  a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986  and inflation negligible so far this year  Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.  I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority  also for the Bundesbank  because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany   he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel  head of research at Citibank AG  says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.  Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors  but also on the external economy   she said. An economist at a German bank  who declined to be identified  said  If Poehl is confirmed in his post  it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply.  One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop  talking down  the dollar. For Poehl  the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.  This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do   Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round  making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer  he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.  But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment   he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled.  They've burnt the fingers of many people   he said. And unlike the speculators  Poehl notes  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit."

"2","China had postponed wide-ranging plans toreform its economy because of financial difficulties and pressure from powerful conservatives within the ruling Communist Party  western diplomats said. But they said that although the conservatives were critical of aspects of the current open-door policy they had no alternative economic program. That meant that the strategy begun by top leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was likely to go on  but at a slower pace  they said. Deng has led China's overhaul of the Stalinist economy built during the rule of Chairman Mao. Since Mao died in 1976 living standards have risen sharply and China has become a net exporter of grain for the first time. A western diplomat said China's leaders had been sufficiently encouraged by their success last year to order the drawing up of plans for more reforms for 1987. These included changes to the country's price system. But he said the biggest reforms had been shelved since economic problems appeared in late 1986 and the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January. The diplomat said the most ambitious reforms would not be on the agenda for a major party meeting later this year. The main economic reform proceeding in 1987 is a system under which factories sign contracts with the government. They can keep any profit over and above the contract amount.  This is a modest reform  a repeat of what China did in the early 1980s   the diplomat said.  It is regarded as second best by the reformers who drew up the more ambitious plans. But these are impractical in the current political and economic climate   he said. A Chinese source said that a month ago Premier Zhao Ziyang decided the media was giving too much coverage to the drive against bourgeois liberalism and not enough to explaining the proposed reforms. Some of these reforms  like price increases  were very unpopular. Zhao ordered the media to give more coverage to the reforms and why they were necessary  the source said. One of China's top economists wrote in the People's Daily last week   Failure to answer people's questions about the new prices has caused great anxiety.  In March  China announced budget deficits for 1986 and 1987. It has had two years of trade deficits  and capital spending and wages are rising fast. On the political front  the conservatives in the Party have been on the offensive since January when Hu resigned. He allegedly failed to fight the growth of western democratic ideas  which the Party has called bourgeois liberalism. A nationwide drive against bourgeois liberalism has been under way since January in the Party and the media. The latter has given wide coverage to those in the leadership who have warned against the errors of all-out westernisation. The economist said   Although reform in any country inevitably causes anxiety and is often risky  it has been proved that  where reform is more daring  commodities are more abundant and people's living standards higher.   But in the countries that are more rigid  the market is stagnant  goods are in short supply and rationing is common   he said. The diplomat said the reformers wanted to complete their unfinished overhaul of China's pricing system. The diplomat said the reformers wanted to make factories independent of the government which would use taxes  credit supply and other indirect means to regulate them instead of administrative diktat as in the past.  But to enact such far-reaching measures they need a stable economy  contented workers and surpluses  to give them manoeuvring room. These conditions do not exist now   he said. Another diplomat said that conservatives within the leadership  though critical of some results of the reforms  had no alternative economic strategy.  The last eight years of opening to the outside world has shown everyone how poor China is and how it has fallen behind other countries   the diplomat said.  Everyone is agreed on the objective that China become a major world power by the early 21st century   he said.  For this  it needs a strong and modernised economy. Where there is disagreement is over the pace of the reforms and the details of some of them.  The Chinese source said the debate over the pace and extent of reforms was still going on.

"2","South Africa is expected to unveiltomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate  economic analysts said. Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education  Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government's overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament  the analysts said. Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1  while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.  Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary  but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation   said Rob Lee  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co. South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct. Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct  while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct. Economists estimate that the government's spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand  with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand  or four pct of GDP. The government  having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade  also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget  analysts said.  The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure   said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview. Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets. South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year  leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP  compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF.  The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned   predicted one analyst  noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years. The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985. Against a background of Western economic sanctions  falling per capita incomes  rising joblessness and high inflation  government officials say economic growth is the prime objective. But private-sector economists caution that the government's ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country's balance of payments. Most of that surplus  this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs  will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks. Within these constraints  economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre. Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely. Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.  This will not be a very exciting budget   commented Harry Schwarz  spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party.  I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election."
"2","The World Bank  in the throes of apainful reorganization  faces new strains because of actions by Citibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves  financial analysts and monetary sources said. The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused some bad feelings and charges that promotions and other personnel actions have been based on personality rather than ability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role in the global debt strategy  the sources said. At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber Conable  whose reorganization efforts are getting some critical review from many Bank staff members and some member- countries including the United States.  I think if he were to do it again  he would do it very differently   said one source. Conable  a former congressman from New York appointed by President Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly a year ago  has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be reorganized and perhaps made more streamlined. In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan administration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market sources of assistance were available. However  the Bank had been singled out for a much greater role under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury Secretary James Baker.  That strategy  which called for some 20 billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine billion dlrs in spending from the development banks  mostly the World Bank  came under profound doubt with the decision by Citibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves. This move  heralded by some sources as a measure that gives all parties more time  frightened others  who see it as the beginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete unraveling of the monetary system. As envisioned by the latter  the next move would be for Brazil  which has delayed payments on its debts  to say it does not intend to pay interest for a very long period of time. Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop financing the country's export credits  the funds countries use to support their daily activities  leading to an economic breakdown.  Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of business   said one source. Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three billion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans to developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by Chase Manhattan some days later. In the best of all worlds  the kind of cooperation that was demonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the multilateral development banks  the wealthy countries and commercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982  could emerge again but no one is expecting that. If anything  the negotiations have become much more confrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more concessions  arguing that they face growing political instability if they are asked to do or pay more. They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and there is sympathy for their view among the development community.  When you hear code words like structural adjustment and tightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent making 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs   says one source. He adds:  And when your hear they should have market forces at play  that means the level of public services should drop.  It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role in the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the debtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent poverty even further. The Bank  which primarily assists countries in the building of roads  sewerage systems  education  and other so-called infrastructure  is viewed in the Third World as benefactor. The IMF  however  which essentially forged the debt stategy following the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near default  is considered a stern taskmaster that has little sympathy or even understanding of poverty. But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative has worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about increased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription which indicated that countries might grow their way out of their difficulty."
"2","The Louvre agreement by the Group of Sevenfinance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Previewing the summit  which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives  Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth  he said.   I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany   he added  but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on  a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.  He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced  satisfactory exchange rate stability   in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks  and he was  content  with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said   we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.  Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord.  Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect.  He said the U.S. Budget deficit was  very important.  Noting the 6 000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said   what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.   There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified   he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in  Japan bashing  at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism  he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries. On debt  Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice. The plan  involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club  was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek  to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit  and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions.  First  it is a blow for realism. Second  because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp   he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.  They have done it to some extent  they need to do it more   Lawson said  adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit.  There is a consensus  which we have to push further."

"2","President Reagan said Paul Volcker hasdeclined to serve another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  the U.S. central bank. Reagan nominated economist Alan Greenspan in his place. Volcker's term expires in August. Reagan  in a brief announcement in the White House briefing room  said he accepted Volcker's decision  with great reluctance and regret.  Volcker  first appointed to the Fed post by President Jimmy Carter in 1979  said  there is a time to leave and a time to come ... I have no feeling I was being pushed.  Volcker  appearing with Reagan  Greenspan  and Treasury Secretary James Baker in the briefing room  said he will remain on the job until Greenspan's nomination is approved by the Senate. In a tribute to a smiling Volcker standing beside him  Greenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman's greatest achievements was reducing inflation.  It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain that those very hard won gains will not be lost. Assuring that will be one of my primary goals   Greenspan said. Financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure of Volcker  who has been widely credited with holding the line on inflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values. Immediately following Reagan's announcement  the U.S. dollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and both the bond and stock markets declined. But Greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar  which has fallen sharply over the past year  has reached its low point.   There certainly is evidence in that direction   Greenspan said when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out. The market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprise because the announcement followed a number of published reports that the White House had decided to reappoint Volcker. Volcker's tenure at the Fed began under the cloud of major inflation under Carter with consumer prices rising more than 10 per cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 per cent.  With Reagan's backing  Volcker pursued a tight money policy that cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reduced interest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade. The tight money policies were also blamed for producing a deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major political problems for Reagan. Reagan reappointed Volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.  Greenspan  who heads his own Wall Street consulting firm  was chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers from September 1974 until January 1977. Greenspan  a Republican  is considered a traditional conservative economist and has been an adviser to several presidents."

"2","Following is the full text of FederalReserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President Reagan declining reappointment to the Fed: Dear Mr. President  As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board approaches  you naturally have to consider an appropriate new appointment.  In that connection  you will recall that  upon my reappointment as chairman in 1983  I felt unable to make a firm commitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a second full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the time  that term is in fact now almost finished. However  I do think  after eight years as chairman  a natural time has now come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably convenient and consistent with an orderly transition. Consequently  I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to assume office.  I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for your unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly  your consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a particularly challenging period for it  for the financial system  and for the economy has been critical to whatever success we have had.  Without doubt  strong challenges remain for all of those involved in economic policy. In that effort  I believe the nation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal Reserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering economic and financial strength and stability and able to bring to that effort a combination of sound and independent professional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan considerations.  May I add  too  my personal best wishes for the remainder of your own term in office during which you have done so much to restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the American people. Faithfully yours  Paul A Volcker"
"2","The scale of foreign exchange interventionthe Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was  content  with sterling's current value  Lawson told reporters he wanted  to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for.  He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves  out today  showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise  pointing to massive currency intervention. In April  reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data  Lawson said   We have been playing a very full part ourselves  in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.  We wish to see it (stability) continuing   he added. Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability  Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle  the market pressures there are from time to time.   Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times   he added. Lawson said he expected intervention to be  sterilised  by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales  when the market allowed. This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention  he said.  Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs   Lawson said.  I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

Speaking to reporters  the Texas Democrat said that based of Greenspan's tenure as chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers his policies would mean higher rates.  His previous service indicates the kind of economic policies based on the trickle down theory rather than the percolate up theory. This theory tends to higher interest rates   Wright said. Wright told reporters he would not have chosen Greenspan to head the Fed  but he declined to name his preference.  It would be someone whose primary interest is in keeping interest rates low. That is the national interest   he said. His main concern was that high interest rates have slowed economic growth and held down the number of new jobs. The United States needs  to reduce the level of interest rates so this economy can get oxygen and breathe   Wright said. Wright said he had not talked with Greenspan about the appointment. Asked to rate Volcker's tenure  he replied   Long."
"2","Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid satisfactory progress has been made in talks with Japan that would lead to membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange for three British merchant banks next year. Following weekend talks here between Japanese and British officials Lawson told reporters  we have achieved our objective.  The three applicants  &lt;Baring Brothers and Co Ltd>  &lt;J.Henry Wagg and Co Ltd> and Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale Plc &lt;KSLL.L>  would join  when the Stock Exchange has been extended   he said. The TSE has said this will be completed in May 1988. It has repeatedly said it cannot accommodate any new members until then because of limited space on its trading floor. During a visit to Tokyo in April  U.K. Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard presented Japanese officials with what he called a non-negotiable timetable for granting the three British securities companies TSE membership. Howard said Britain expected a favourable response at last weekend's meeting and wanted the firms to be made members before next May. If Tokyo failed to act  Britain was ready to retaliate against Japanese financial groups in London  he added. Last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans to set up a special committee to study the membership question. The committee is due to produce a report by the autumn. This would allow the TSE to announce formally by the end of the year who will be granted membership  although the companies chosen would not be able to start trading until May."
"2","Finance Minster Gerhard Stoltenberg praisedthe excellent leadership of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker whom the White House said will not be standing for a third term when his current period in office expires.  Paul Volcker will go down in U.S. History as one of the important chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board. By his excellent leadership he has also won our great respect   Stoltenberg said in a Finance Ministry statement. The minister described Volcker's successor  economist Alan Greenspan  as an experienced and capable man and wished him all the best in his new role."
"2","Paul Volcker's decision not to go for athird term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem rising inflation  financial market analysts said. Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation fighter in the Volcker mould  doubts are already surfacing in the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough campaign against inflation over the next year or two.  The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with inflation   said Stephen Axilrod  Vice Chairman of Nikko Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for monetary and financial policy at the Fed.  A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's departure. Until Greenspan answers them  the markets will remain nervous   added Stephen Slifer  money market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a tailspin  which was halted only by concerted central bank intervention in the open currency market."
"2","West German officials said they could makeno comment on remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker who said Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers had agreed a new process for economic coordination. At last year's G-7 summit in Tokyo  senior government officials were requested to make a study of how economic data could be better coordinated and the results of their work will be presented at next week's summit in Venice. West Germany has said governments should not be obliged to take economic steps purely in reaction to economic data. The U.S. Position on data coordination has been that governments should react accordingly when economic indicators fall short of expectations. The West German stance on coordination of data  which has also been shared by the British government  has been a potential threat to a joint stance by the G-7 on this topic. At a news conference in Washington  Baker would not be specific about what agreement had been reached on data coordination by the seven finance ministers."

"2","Finance Minister Edouard Balladur isundecided over his future in office after next Spring's presidential election  his spokesman said.  He (Balladur) has taken no definitive decision about his activities in a year's time   his spokesman said in answer to a Reuters question. He was responding to questions on a comment made by Balladur  a close political associate of right wing Prime Minister Jacques Chirac  in a radio interview. Balladur told a Radio Monte Carlo interviewer  From next year I shall rediscover the freedom of private life.  France is due to hold a presidential election in April or May next year. Under the French political system  the prime minister and his cabinet tender their resignation to the incoming President  giving him freedom to appoint a new government. Chirac  leader of a two-party coalition government is widely assumed to be a presidential candidate  while incumbent Socialist President Francois Mitterrand is tipped by most opinion polls to win if he decides to stand again. Balladur's stringent economic policies have come under increasing criticism inside and outside the coalition parties in recent months as official statistics and forecasts have shown slowing growth prospects and rising inflation. But the spokesman said Balladur was having no second thoughts about the direction of his policies.  The Minister of State (Balladur) has one current ambition  which is to achieve his mission of national economic recovery   he said.  He refuses to prejudge the future a year from now."
"2","Alan Greenspan  who has been nominatedto replace Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  is regarded by financial analysts as a conservative economist who will take a strong stand against inflation.  He'll be a strong fighter against inflation   said Martin Regalia  director of research and economics at the National Council of Savings Institutions. Greenspan has broad experience both in running his own private economic consulting firm - Townsend-Greenspan - and in government service. He was President Ford's top economic adviser  serving as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from September 1974 until January 1977. During that time  inflation rising above 10 percent  a was a major political concern during Ford's administration.  He's had a lot of experience with inflation  and as an inflation fighter   Richard Medley  partner with Smick-Medley and Associates  said of Greenspan.  He had that seared into his memory during that period   Medley added."
"2","General Motors Corp said in a corporatestatement its executives can think of  no person better qualified  than Alan Greenspan to replace Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.  Greenspan possesses great understanding of both the American and international economies and the interaction between them   the company said in a statement.  He also possesses enormous good judgement.  No other possible replacement for Paul Volcker would be more likely to have as steadying an influence on and be as well received by financial markets here and overseas as Alan Greenspan  it said. GM also said the U.S. owes Volcker  a great debt of gratitiude  by wringing inflation out of the U.S. economy."
"2","Henry Kaufman  managing director ofSalomon Brothers Inc  said the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets.  The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward  interrupted by intermittent rallies   Kaufman said in a statement. He said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish. Kaufman said   Unlike Paul Volcker  who entered the office of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally  Mr Greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets.  Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S. economy  while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited  Kaufman noted.  Consequently  although he is well known abroad  his views on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."
"2","U.K. Bankers for the most part laudedoutgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his achievements over the past eight years but expressed some uncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan  nominated by President Reagan to succeed him.  One of Volcker's greatest achievements was the sense of continuity and stability he gave to the international markets   said Carlos Santistevan  executive director of Libra Bank Plc. However  it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan to fill that role and the degree to which he can do so  he said. Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm  Townesend  Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration.  He is a prominent and well known figure in the U.S.  said David Lomax  Group Economics Adviser at National Westminster Bank Plc  who described Greenspan as an  orthodox Republican economist  who may be better suited to getting the U.S. Economy on track than Volcker. But for the most part bankers in London are unfamiliar with Greenspan's views on domestic and international economics or the international debt crisis.  I will be sad to see Volcker go. He is a central banker of good repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And international banking system   said Libra's Santistevan. Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted countries  he said  adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as familiar with the problem and the personalities involved. For this reason he expects there will be little change in the Fed's approach to the debt crisis  even as U.S. Commercial banks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding billions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on third world debt. Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American debt problem also doubted there would be much change post-Volcker  but for other reasons. He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative which called for greater contributions by banks  governments and multilateral organization  government's have done little to try to improve the situation  leaving the bulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers. Despite the Fed's independence from central government  he questioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the job so close to the next Presidential election. News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the financial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on foreign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank intervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover somewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one point  while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost more than one point. But despite the disruption in the markets  Lloyds Bank Plc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the announcement was well-timed  given the recent rise in the dollar against the mark and yen. In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar has fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today announcing his nomination Greenspan said  there certainly is evidence  that the dollar had bottomed out. However  many economists here believe that the recent rise in the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to fall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to reverse.  The dollar has further to fall  although it may take a few years  said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important thing is that there is a soft landing. Like other economists  Johnson is anxious to hear Greenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.  He has everything going for him but he must establish credibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and the outlook for interest rates   he said. Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard a stance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when his tightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates to record levels.  He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and only relaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted (in 1982)   National Westminster's Lomax said. Lomax said that Greenspan  if appointed  will inherit the agreements entered into by Volcker with other members of the Group of Five industrial nations on the dollar. However  he said that the danger lies in dollar stability being maintained because of a monetary policy that is too tight. Too firm a monetary policy could send the U.S. Into recession  which would not be welcome by European counterparts  he said."
"2","President Reagan called for continuednondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United States in the face of congressional opposition because of the Bucharest government's record on human rights. A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for Romania had been  exceptionally difficult  and came after  all options were seriously considered.  But the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the Bucharest government  the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on human rights practices there. The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania  Hungary and China. The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN for Hungary and China."
"2","Paul Volcker's departure as FederalReserve Board chairman came despite pleas from the Reagan administration that he stay at the helm of the U.S. central bank  U.S. officials said.  The President made it very clear that he would be very  very pleased had the chairman's decision been otherwise   Treasury Secretary James Baker said. A Reagan administration official  who asked not to be identified  said Baker too had urged Volcker repeatedly in the past several months to consider staying on as chairman. But there were no indications the administration had told Volcker that it was in the national interest for him to stay and that current global economic uncertainties required it. Associates of Volcker have assumed Volcker would only have stayed on in such circumstances.  He doesn't care a lot  emotionally  about a third term   Nikko Securities vice-chairman Stephen Alixrod  until last year a top Fed staffer  told Reuters recently. Officials are confident that newly-nominated chairman Alan Greenspan will re-establish close working relations with Baker and his credentials eventually will calm markets. One Reagan administration economic policymaker  who asked not to be named  pointed out that Baker and Greenspan worked together closely in the Ford administration. At the time  Baker was acting Secretary of Commerce and Greenspan headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Reagan administration officials made clear  meanwhile  that the announcement  precipitated by Volcker's unshakeable decision to quit  came in order to clear up uncertainty ahead of the Summit of leading industrial democracies in Venice. President Reagan might have been in an embarrassing position if no decision had been made by then. Volcker enjoys the respect of most top economic officials abroad  and is admired at the West German Bundesbank  and in Tokyo  despite his criticism  of Japanese policies. Financial markets  possibly reflecting some of the disappointment in foreign capitals  drove the dollar sharply lower on news of his departure  prompting central bank intervention to stem the fall  dealers said. Finance Ministries and central banks of the other summit nations -- Japan  West Germany  Britain  France  Italy and Canada -- were informed shortly before the news was announced  Baker told reporters today. Monetary sources also said one reason Volcker decided to resign was his personal financial situation and his marriage -- his wife lives in New York and did not want him to take up a second term in mid-1983. Volcker has foregone potentially million-dollar salaries to a life almost overwhelmingly devoted to public service at pay rates low relative to his financial commitments. Both these reasons at one time prompted him to consider stepping down before his second term was completed. But Volcker also hinted there might be more than personal reasons for his decision.  It was a personal decision  taking account of a lot of things  including purely personal considerations and others   he told reporters. Fed sources note Volcker's considerable unease at the lack of progress by the administration in reaching a budget deficit reduction agreement. In addition  Volcker would have faced four more years with a Board that he was less than comfortable with  monetary sources say. The other five members are Reagan appointees. What may unsettle markets  however  is the fact that the Fed governors now have only six to seven years' collective experience between them  at a time of great financial uncertainty. Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be considered as tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker  his Republican credentials could make him more of a political Fed chairman than Volcker. An administration official said Volcker was consulted on Greenspan  and very much approved of his replacement.  But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to the administration  to whom he has been an unofficial economic adviser  with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns had with the Nixon administration. Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration viewpoint than Volcker has been  and Burns was less willing to make radical policy changes. Making clear his decision was a strong one  Volcker told reporters   I told (Reagan) with considerable definitiveness yesterday.  Administration officials said Volcker arrived at the White House yesterday afternoon with his resignation. When renominated in mid-1983  Volcker said he would probably step down within two years. Monetary sources said the departure of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor that convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almost from the start of the administration. Another  these sources said  was the prospect of being able to work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle the international debt crisis and deal with the then high-flying dollar."

"2","The Bank of Canada  the country's centralbank  believes economist Alan Greenspan was a sound choice to replace retiring U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker  a spokesman for the bank said.  Mr. Greenspan is well known to the bank. He's had a lot of experience. He's very capable  and with Mr. Volcker's decision not to seek reappointment  he's a sound choice   said Roy Flett  associate secretary for the bank. Flett said   the Bank of Canada has enjoyed an excellent relationship with Mr. Volcker during his terms and has only the greatest respect for his performance.  Economists said the appointment was extremely important to Canada because the country's monetary policy is closely linked with that of the U.S.  Basically  we have chosen ... to march in lockstep with U.S. monetary policy  so really in some sense this is our central banker that has just been appointed as well   said Mike McCracken  head of Infometrica Ltd."
"2","Brazilian officials are privatelyexpressing concern that the change of command at the Federal Reserve may lead to a tougher U.S. Policy on debt and less understanding of the problems of the Third World. Paul Volcker  head of the Federal Reserve  was considered here to be understanding of Brazil's difficulties. A Finance Ministry source said of his colleagues in the ministry:  They are a bit apprehensive about (Alan) Greenspan (who will replace Volcker)  considering his reputation as a very tough man  an advocate of recessive measures to counter-attack inflation. There is a little bit of concern."

"2","Paul Volcker's resignation as FederalReserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a time of deep uncertainty about the future management of the third-world debt crisis  bankers said. They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold the financial system together when Mexico halted interest payments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever since.  Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly there's a terrible void   one New York banker said. Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed because International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it hard to make a mark as World Bank president  bankers said. Moreover  Volcker's successor  Alan Greenspan  has little experience of international affairs and third world debt.  Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues and the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker has. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S. That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive feeling   one banker said. This banker  who has discussed debt questions with Greenspan  described his views as simplistic. But Robert Hormats of Goldman  Sachs and Co said he was not worried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.  People rush to judgment  but once they get to know Greenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement   said Hormats  a former Administration official. Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the initial comparison  Hormats said.  Volcker had the status of a financial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight   he said. One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker  together with the Bank of England  deserves credit for keeping the banking system intact after Mexico's default.  If it hadn't been for him  the world would look a lot different now   he said.  Whether you agreed with him or not  he has a superb grasp of ideas.  Certainly  not all bankers did agree all the time with Volcker. In particular  he was roundly criticized by some for more or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico generous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt rescheduling agreement.  Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the bounds and pushing the package onto the banks   commented one banker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal. Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed  who said the 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and thus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets. It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of others that followed it for Chile  Venezuela  the Philippines and Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt crisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to bolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.  It certainly contributed to the general feeling of malaise   one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of the Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses. That decision  since followed by Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific Corp  may profoundly alter the strategy of creditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis. But no one is sure what the impact will be.  It's very difficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is going  and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the uncertainty   one banker said."
"2","Currency futures are likely to movehigher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated as his replacement  currency analysts said. Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation  analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular  uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency  analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing a bottom  but the market will bear in mind his remarks in Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower  analysts said.   Disappointment of European central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower   said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff.  The international community will not like this appointment   as it suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to reduce the deficit  added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner. Furthermore   that Greenspan was not named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid   Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to  jawboning  at the G-7 summit  he said. But G-7 finance ministers  judged by recent statements  may be at an impasse  analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate cuts  despite pressure from the U.S. to do so  Mackoff said. The U.S.  on the other hand  has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West Germany have urged  she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years  a further decline in the dollar could be forestalled  Horner said. However   the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes   Horner said. Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance. For the next two weeks  Sloan calls for September yen futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target  while Swiss francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950."
"2","Brazil's new economic plan should enableBrazil to renew negotiations with creditors on its 111-billion dlr foreign debt within the next 30 days  Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira said. The plan  which predicted the economy would grow 4.5 pct this year and inflation would drop to 10 pct a month by December from 20 pct at present  would be officially announced  within three or four weeks   he told a news conference. The minister said he presented an outline of the program during a cabinet meeting in which President Jose Sarney declared  a total war  on inflation. Sarney told the meeting an austerity plan to trim government spending would be introduced. Bresser Pereira said Brazil faced the risk of economic recession  but he estimated the gross national product would grow 4.5 pct this year. It grew 8.3 pct last year. Its April inflation rate was a record 20.96 pct and contributed to an accumulated rate of 84.19 pct in the first four months of 1987. Bresser Pereira said the economic plan would seek to keep the economy growing  to build an eight billion dlr trade surplus and to force a sharp drop in the inflation rate."

"2","Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30  Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens said today. Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm price package which has endured since March. Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had to be referred to heads of government. These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and vegetable fats and oils  and proposals to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in European currency units (Ecus)  are translated into the currencies of member states. The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S.  A major exporter of soybeans to the EC. West Germany  meanwhile  is strongly against the technical currency move  which would result in additional price cuts for farmers in countries with strong currencies  such as the mark. Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean heads of government diverting their attention from much more important world and Community issues. Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest themselves in such technically complex questions. However  Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some nuances in member state positions  which may make the dialogue more constructive in the next few weeks.  If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month  the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct cut in cereals prices  farm trade sources said. It originally proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this year  with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops. Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency reforms. The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year. Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's meeting very useful  diplomats said there was little sign of a major shift in the position of member states  or of finance ministers adopting a different line from that of their agriculture colleagues. The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their differences."
"2","Africa's efforts to revive itseconomy are not being matched by international help  two of the continent's heads of state said at the opening of a conference. Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou- Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to act over the continent's debt  which now totals 175 billion dlrs  at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). Their view was backed by Monique Landry  Canada's Minister for External Relations.  Whether we look at aid or debt or trade  the rich countries have not as yet lived up to their part of last year's economic recovery pact.  Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country to spend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicing particularly as prices for the continent's commodities were so unstable. Sassou Nguesso  current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity  accused international aid donors of failing to provide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago. The conference  attended by African ministers  economists and representatives from major donors  will review progress since both sides agreed at the U.N. Last year to revive the African economy over five years. The response from the international community has been negative and projections of improved growth rates for Africa already look far too optimistic  ECA Executive Secretary Adebayo Adedeji told the conference. Both Babangida and Sassou Nguesso called for the debts of Africa's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment and grace terms to be eased. They won a degree of support from Landry   Even private bankers are willing to talk about the need for longer term solutions to Africa's debt."
"2","Bonn is expected to rush throughlegislation this month creating special credits to protect West German farmers from a proposed European Community  EC  payments freeze  government sources said. The new measures are apparently designed to shield West German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC executive commission's farm policy reform plans  political sources said. EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over future farm financing. West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing imports of vegetable oil and fats  for fear of U.S. retaliation. Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports. The draft legislation  which the ruling centre-right coalition will present to parliament tomorrow  would provide temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels. The Commission  facing a five billion European Currency Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the year  has threatened to start phasing out payment of some subsidies and premiums from August  unless EC member states take urgent measures to provide fresh funds. West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to a farm price package for 1986/87. Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies by creating a buffer for West German farmers. The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1  ahead of the summer recess  SPD sources said. SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party would support the bill  even though it would further swell massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill was an admission that the government believes the farm price talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy. According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters  government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1 billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and premiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer. The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually. But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks (55 mln dlrs) in interest payments  farm policy sources said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the bill when it meets tomorrow."
"2","Treasury Secretary JamesBaker said any further decline in the dollar against other currencies would be counterproductive. Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could see some further decline in the dollar within reason.  All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in the dollar would be counterproductive   Baker told reporters. Following the Venice press conference by Reagan  the White House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that the United States wants a stable dollar. The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit  but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar against the yen and the mark during the past two years."
"2","President Reagan today sent aclassified report to Congress on his plan to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers with U.S. military escorts. Congressional officials said the report  received by House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate majority leader Robert Byrd  will not be made public. Congress has demanded a detailed security plan on how U.S. warships and servicemen would be protected from possible attack in the Gulf region  scene of the prolonged war between Iran and Iraq. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration intended to push ahead with the plan despite strong opposition in Congress. He said the report to Congress provided a comprehensive overview of Administration strategy in the Gulf  adding the military escort plan would begin  when the President was satisfied that all preparations had been completed satisfactorily . Fitzwater did not say when this might be  but denied the protection plan was being held up."
"2","The Japanese economy has bottomed outafter an extended period of stagnation  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference. But he said he was not too optimistic about the state of the economy as the employment situation was still shaky in certain regions of the country. Yesterday  the Finance Ministry said its quarterly corporate survey showed that the economy was showing increasing signs of recovery."
"2","Treasurer Paul Keating said he nowexpected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs. In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figures showed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs  Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about 1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billion issued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August. However  the government had subsequently revised the forecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of current account figures indicated a declining trend. Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecast compares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in 1985/86  a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficit recorded only two years earlier in 1983/84. Keating said the main reason for his revision was a better-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterly figures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year to March 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct  he said. The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficit for the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billion dlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier."
"2","Treasurer Paul Keating said theopposition's tax-cutting policy  a key issue in the run up to the July 11 elections  was a miscalculation that would severely damage the Australian economy. Opposition leader John Howard disputed Keating's allegations.  Keating is engaged in a desperate  last ditch panic attempt to deny long-suffering Australian taxpayers the cuts to which they are entitled   he said. Keating said in a radio interview that errors in Howard's plan  including  double counting   would increase the budget deficit and could push interest rates above 20 pct. Keating said that Treasury officials who had studied Howard's plans concluded that his proposed tax and spending cuts would result in a nine billion dlr deficit and damage international market confidence in Australia. In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budget deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and three billion dlrs. Howard has said a conservative government under his leadership would reduce the 55 pct top personal and company tax level to 38 pct and fund the reduction by cutting government spending. Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke have promised not to increase taxes or impose new ones  but rejected any tax cuts. Instead they called for wage and other economic restraints to help overcome balance of payments and foreign debt problems. Inflation declined to 9.4 pct for the year to March 31 from an annual 9.8 pct at the end of the December quarter. Hawke has said inflation would fall to six pct by the middle of next year. Australian bank lending rates to best customers have dropped to around 16.5 pct from a high of 19 pct nine months ago."
"2","The Australian government has givensupport in principle to the production of platinum and silver bullion coins at the Perth Mint  Treasurer Paul Keating said. This followed the success of the Australian Nugget gold bullion coins launched this year  he said in a statement. He said that  as with the Australian nuggets  the coins would be legal tender. The platinum coins would be made in four weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight. He said detailed arrangements for their issue would be finalised after talks between the Federal authorities and the Western Australian government  owner of the Perth Mint."
"2","The New Zealand government isforecasting a budget surplus of 379 mln N.Z. Dlrs for the year ending March 1988  Finance Minister Roger Douglas said in a statement. This compares with a deficit of 1.95 billion dlrs in the year ending March 1987 and a 1.87 billion dlr deficit a year earlier. Total expenditure is seen at 22.907 billion dlrs against 20.94 billion in the year to end-March 1987. Total revenue is seen at 23.29 billion dlrs against 18.992 billion. The forecast rise in revenue comes partly from the 10 pct value added goods and services Tax (GST) introduced in October 1986 which is seen bringing in 4.1 billion dlrs against 1.23 billion a year earlier. Other indirect taxation is seen rising to 3.1 billion dlrs from 2.2 billion. Company tax is forecast to bring in 2.39 billion dlrs against 1.22 billion a year earlier while the tax take from individuals is seen little changed at 10.7 billion dlrs against 10.9 billion. Excluding revenue and expenditure of a capital nature  such as repayment of loans by state-owned enterprises or revenue from asset sales  the budget would indicate a deficit of 1.27 billion dlrs  Douglas said Using this  financial deficit  method the deficit in the year to end March 1987 was 1.89 billion dlrs  he said. Douglas said using this method  the financial deficit forecast for 1987/88 measures 2.2 pct of gross domestic product against 6.9 pct a year earlier."
"2","New Zealand will repay a portion ofits 42.48 billion N.Z. Dlr public debt for the first time since 1952 as a result of a 379 mln N.Z. Dlr budget surplus for fiscal March 1988  Finance Minister Roger Douglas said. Douglas said in a budget statement the surplus is the first achieved in New Zealand in 35 years. It compared with a 1.95 billion dlr deficit in fiscal 1987. Douglas said this year's government bond tender program would be adjusted in the light of the surplus  providing for the repayment of up to 600 mln dlrs of New Zealand's 21.74 billion dlrs of overseas debt. Details of which loans will be repaid have still to be decided. Douglas said the present scale of the public debt was massive.  It will take many years to reduce the debt to an acceptable level   he said."
"2","Finance Minister Roger Douglas saidNew Zealand would enact legislation to prevent local companies and individuals from using overseas tax havens. The government would also outlaw the practice of double deduction of losses by dual resident companies  known as  double dipping   Douglas said in a budget statement. The anti-tax-haven legislation would affect non-resident entities  such as companies and trusts  set up in low tax countries and earning mainly passive investment income  Douglas said. A consultative document will be released in September explaining the proposed legislation  and a consultative committee will then receive public submissions and advise the government on implementation  Douglas said. The legislation would attack tax avoidance but not genuine business activity  he added. He said some New Zealand residents were avoiding New Zealand tax entirely by setting up non-resident entities in tax havens  which intercepted and gathered income taxable in New Zealand. In a move to counter  double dipping   the government would no longer allow dual resident companies to group their losses  Douglas said. The proposed legislation would require them to carry tax losses forward to be offset against future profits  effective for income years starting after December 17  1986."
"2","Congressional Democratic leadersannounced a compromise has been reached on a 1988 budget  paving the way for final approval of a trillion dollar spending plan. House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd told a news conference that final congressional approval of the plan to reduce an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit next year to 134 billion dlr was expected next week. The plan was worked out by Democrats who control both House and Senate but who have been stalemated for a month over different House and Senate budgets that passed earlier. The budget proposes 19.5 billion dlrs in new taxes next year  65 billion dlrs over a three year span. It would cut President Reagan's request to spend 298 billion dlrs for defense in 1988 by about nine billion dlrs  but only if he accepts the proposed tax increase to pay for it. If Reagan rejects the tax rise  which he has said he would  defense spending under the plan would drop automatically by about five billion dlrs  the leaders said. Reagan's own budget was rejected by wide margins in both House and Senate by a combination of Democrats and his own Republican party who said it was unrealistic."
"2","Analysts said they were surprised atthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy. Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year. Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets. Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus. The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets  one analyst said. Paradoxically  the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term  despite lower interest rates  as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand  he said. However  some foreign exchange dealers disagreed  saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower. The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading  against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release. Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market  despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures. One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow. The Budget statement was broadly as expected  with a continuation of existing policies  and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors  another said. But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market  particularly multi-national companies. The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements  through bond tenders  as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion. Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure  another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible.  Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects   he said. An election is due before the end of September."
"2","New York Federal Reserve President E.Gerald Corrigan said he favors bank reform but wants to maintain the separation of banking and commerce.  As I see it  the case for fundamental reform in our banking and financial system is compelling   Corrigan told the Senate Banking Committee. Corrigan said he believed bank reform should allow banks to offer a broad range of banking and financial services. He said common ownership of banks  thrifts  securities firms and insurance companies should be allowed but commercial firms should not own or control insured depositories. Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc) said he would press for bank reform legislation this year and supported giving banks new power for commercial paper  mortgage-backed securities  municipal bond underwriting and mutual funds. Former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston said bank reform should reflect the reality that other companies were offering banking services such as checking accounts credit cards and mortgages.   The reality is that there is one-stop financial shopping at banks in some states  but not in others   Wriston said.  There is also one-stop financial shopping in all 50 states at a Sears store or American Express office.   We must find ways for banks to deliver new products to new customers in order to maintain a spread of risk in a business that is rapidly losing traditional products and customers   he said. But John Weinberg of Goldman  Sachs and Co said allowing banks to enter the securities business would make banks too powerful."

The mission  headed by Gabin Ran Kankani  head of the Bank's Brazil division  met Finance Ministry secretary Nailson Nobrega. Officials said they had provided the World Bank with information on the economic plan now being drawn up by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira. The government has invited the IMF to come to study the plan next Monday. Bresser Pereira will use the plan as the basis for negotiations with creditors next month in an attempt to reschedule the country's 111 billion dollar debt."

"2","British companies are being largelyfrozen out of President Reagan's  Star Wars  project despite earlier hopes of lucrative contracts from the research bonanza  according to a report by Members of Parliament (MPs). Funding for the project  formally known as the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI)  has so far amounted to some 7.5 billion dlrs  parliament's Defence Committee said. But British contractors have won only 34 mln dlrs of this -- 20 mln dlrs on a government-to-government basis  with the rest secured directly by U.K. Firms and institutions. In December 1985  Britain and the United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) relating to cooperative research for the Strategic Defence Initiative. At the time  hopes were expressed that U.K. Industrial participation would lead to significant spin-off of technology  both of other defence areas and to the civil sector. But the all-party committee report said  the debate about the merits of U.K. Participation in SDI has now to be conducted within a rather different context than was the case when the MoU was negotiated.... It has become evident that SDI participation may not be the great bonanza that some thought.  British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been one of President Reagan's few staunch supporters on his plan to development an anti-ballistic missile defence screen. But government sources said she has become angry about bureaucratic barriers to British companies trying to break into the lucrative American defence market generally -- a view voiced again today by her defence minister  George Younger. He told a gathering here of British and American businessmen   We in Europe greatly welcome the emphasis which you in the U.S. Have placed on cooperation and collaboration in the defence equipment sphere.  He added   But I do worry that the failure of important and influential individuals in Congress and elsewhere to realise the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas  technology and equipment will lead to the erection of artificial barriers.   I am afraid that the danger signals are only too visible in the form of both of the legislative proposals which seem to arise with ever increasing frequency on (Capitol) Hill  and of new regulations from the U.S. Administration   Younger said.  The defence balance of trade with the U.K. and other allies is still markedly in favour of the U.S.  Thatcher will visit Washington next month for talks with President Reagan. U.K. Government officials said she would probably raise the subject of defence trade when they meet. The report by Parliament's Defence Committee said that the British position towards SDI was based on four points agreed between Thatcher and Reagan in December 1984  they being that: - The aim was not superiority  but to maintain balance - SDI-related deploymewnt would be a matter for negotiation - The overall aim is to enhance  not undercut  deterence - East-West negotiation should aim to achieve security with reduced levels of offensive systems on both sides. The committee in its report said   we very much support the government's view that SDI research should proceed only within the framework of the Camp David  four points  and in particular that it should be in entire conformity with the provisions of the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty.   We note that all present and envisaged SDI work undertaken by UK contractors falls in the  narrow  interpretation of the treaty  (and) we recommend that the government takes the appropriate steps to ensure that this continues to be the case.  That definition prohibits the U.S. And Soviet Union from developing  testing or deploying ABM systems  experts said. That recommendation would of course change  it added  if  it has become clear that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in renouncing the constraints of the narrow interpretation.  Regarding possibilities for technology spin-offs  the committee report said that  the present predominance of  paper studies  in SDI contracts awarded to British firms and institutions militates against any such achievement."

"2","Finance Minister Roger Douglas saidthe fall in share prices on local and world markets demonstrated that New Zealand could not be isolated from global trends.  We can't expect to isolate ourselves from developments around the world   Douglas told reporters.  I think above all what today's problems illustrate is that the sort of policies that we have been putting in place the last three years are absolutely essential so that New Zealand's economic performance improves  relative to the rest of the world.  The New Zealand share market fell 14.7 pct on Tuesday in a record one-day fall. Douglas told a news conference  at which the government announced plans to sell its 89 pct stake in &lt;New Zealand Steel Ltd>  that the sharemarket fall would not affect plans to sell parts of state-owned corporations such as &lt;Air New Zealand>  &lt;DFC New Zealand Ltd> and &lt;Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd>. Asked if the government considered acting to close the sharemarket for a period  Douglas said:  No. I'm not sure it would have been my job to do so."
"2","Government and monetary authorities todaystaged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to their ability to succeed.  The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses) and the Finance Ministry is limited   said Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Peter Morgan. Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the Tokyo Stock Exchange  ministry officials said. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation. But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market collapse and subsequent recession. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic recovery and exchange rate stability. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm the panic  saying in a statement that world stock markets were excessively concerned about the economic future. Traditionally  the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities Co Ltd  Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd  Daiwa Securities Co Ltd  and Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because of their sheer size and overwhelming market share. This strength has in the past made it possible for the brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance Ministry  analysts said. But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages  which have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets over the past year  would have the strength this time to turn things around.  The question is  are the Japanese brokerages strong enough to force investors to buy   said Johsen Takahashi  research director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.  If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in the bond markets and in their U.S. Investments  it is debatable whether they they could support buying   he said.  We can support things to some extent  but we can't completely suppress selling   said one Japanese broker. Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held by financial institutions and other corporations could have a stabilising effect on the market. Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders  said Keikichi Honda  general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's economic research division.  This is a tightly woven textile. In its own way it is stronger than Wall Street.  But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.  If a high percent of shares is cross held  everything happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger   said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.  Selling will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no liquidity.   You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market -- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers   said Barclay's Morgan. Shares held by what are termed  stable shareholders   or banks and other companies with which a firm does business  might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets bad enough  some analsyst said.  Closely held shares could become unclosely held   said Morgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now because companies  with their improved earnings prospects  do not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons."
"2","Oil prices would skyrocket for a time ifconflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz  but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf. But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association  he said   If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off  I believe the world oil supply  given time to adjust  can take care of the situation.   But this is not to say that prices  at least for a short duration  will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation   he declared. Tensions in the Gulf  however  usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices  he added. Assessing future price trends  he said   Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate  but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel.  The upward deviations  however  are likely to be greater than the downward ones.   The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate   he added.  Non-Opec production may still go up  competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand.  Subroto  a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members  said speculation may play havoc with spot prices  but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers. In the medium term  non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s  leaving Opec much stronger  he said."
"2","Rises in West German and internationalinterest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said.  We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern   Poehl told an investment conference.  I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates   he said. Shortly after Poehl spoke  the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September. The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl  Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend  criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy  but to markets' expectations  and currency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations  Poehl said  You have to get to the root of the problem  you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.  The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated  he said. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany  saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target  arousing criticism from other quarters  he said.  Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries  where interest rates have risen substantially more   Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates  which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market  he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.  The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway   he said  noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures. The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention  he said."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's flotation of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> shares despite the collapse on international stock markets.  We are going ahead because the whole issue has been underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a risk of this sort of thing happening   Lawson said in a BBC radio interview. Lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the London stock market took BP shares down a further 33p to 283  well below the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg issue. Lawson said the U.K. Economy is fundamentally sound and added that stock markets had reflected that recently.  I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to say the markets are infallible.   My advice to small investors...Is to remain calm. There is absolutely no reason not to do so   Lawson said."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the severity of the current rout on world stock markets was an absurd over-reaction sparked on Wall Street by a spreading lack of confidence in the U.S. Economy. Lawson said in a BBC radio interview   This began on Wall Street. It has a lot to do with the American stock market (and) a lack of confidence in the U.S. -  and some careless talk by those who should have known better.  In a further wave of selling this morning in London  the FTSE 100 index had lost a further 233.2 points only 50 minutes after the official 0800 GMT opening to stand at 1 819.1. Lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to have been expected after the bull markets of recent years.  What was not expected was the severity of the downturn  which quite frankly is rather absurd.  He said he saw no fundamental signs why the U.S. Economy should go into recession  adding   Indeed the possibility of higher (U.S.) interest rates would certainly in my judgment not lead the American economy into a recession.   The only way in which the American economy would go into recession was if it actually talks itself into recession   he said."
"2","President Corazon Aquino said economicgrowth took priority over debt repayments but she sought to dispel fears that the Philippines would not honour a July agreement rescheduling 13.2 billion dlrs of debt. In a speech to 13 major business groups  Aquino said   Our policy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must take priority  for the plain and simple reason that if we have no money to pay  we can't. And if we starve the nation of essential services  there may be no one around to honour the debt.  Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditor banks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15 effective date.  That should end speculation and remove at least one excuse for hoarding dollars   Aquino said. Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and the end of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets have triggered dollar-hoarding. Aquino said the country's foreign debt  which rose to nearly 29 billion dlrs in April  was growing even without fresh borrowing. Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct of export earnings  Aquino said. Over the next six years  the Philippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs while getting only four billion dlrs in new loans. Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about her government's ambitious privatisation program.  There is always an excuse for government not to sell   she said  but she added:  I want government to get out of business.  She said non-performing assets would be sold in open bidding and Filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms."
"2","Former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister  will face a tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of his two-year term  economists and businessmen said. Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. However  leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership.  Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision and policies   Takashi Ishihara  chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development  said in a statement. Economists generally agreed that there will be no major changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader. However  expectations are high among major industries for new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with the U.S.  Administrative and tax reforms  and soaring land prices. Eishiro Saito  chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren)  urged Takeshita to succeed in unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as possible to tackle difficult tasks. Regarding foreign economic polices  Yoshitoki Chino  chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association  said Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before economic issues develop into problems. Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are doubts about his capability in handling international issues due to his lack of experience in diplomacy  economists said. Economists said foreign countries should be patient with Takeshita  who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician.

"2","West German Finance minister GerhardStoltenberg said the meeting on Monday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker underscored the determination of the U.S. And West Germany to continue close cooperation to stabilise foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told a news conference  The statement released yesterday (Monday) after the private meeting .... Emphasized our determination to continue the close economic cooperation regarding foreign exchange stabilization and monetary policy.  Stoltenberg said that he  Baker and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had all reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their meeting on Monday. Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several European counterparts showed that they shared this view.  We expect the declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect   he said. He noted that the dollar firmed again in late U.S. Trading after the outcome of the Baker meeting was published."
"2","West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said the Louvre accord was vital to West Germany. Stoltenberg told a news conference  Given West Germany's unusually high dependence on world trade and exports  it is vital for West Germany ... To continue its constructive contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the basis of the Louvre accord.  Some monetary analysts have speculated that inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course of tighter monetary policy. Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting on Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what  if any  policy decisions the Bundesbank might take."
"2","West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg declined to comment on whether unpublished target zones for currencies agreed at last February's Louvre accord had been changed as a result of the meeting on Monday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.

Stoltenberg referred to a statement released after Monday's meeting  which said continuing cooperation was aimed at promoting currency stability at current levels. This was the same formula used in the text of the Louvre accord  he noted."
"2","West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said he could not rule out the possibility of central bank intervention to support currencies. Asked at a news conference whether central banks were prepared to intervene to defend currencies  he said  We cannot rule out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign currency stability.

"2","U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platformsin the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs  Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying. The rigs  one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday  were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf  the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the Reshadat rigs  120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in international waters  were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year."
"2","Iranian Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavireiterated his country would retaliate for U.S. Navy attacks on Gulf oil platforms.

On Monday U.S. Navy warships blasted the Rostam platform  and Navy personnel stormed a second platform a few miles away. Washington said the operation was aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault neutral Gulf shipping."
"2","Indonesia told the oil industry onTuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate  but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto  in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association  said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.  In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry  the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws   Suharto said.  Apart from that  the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry   he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration.  As we all have heard this morning  the President is fully aware of this situation   Subroto said.  The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia  albeit on a selective basis.  Indonesia  one of the 13 members of OPEC  must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade  oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems  including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies  and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly  the President of state oil company Pertamina  has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas  such as when a field is designated commercial  and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical  and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts  even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years.  This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.  Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001  industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective  based on how much capital would be invested."
"2","Iran is preparing lawsuits to file forcompensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms  Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying. The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated  he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs. The rigs  one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday  were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack  he said. Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs  except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence.  Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed  Aqazadeh said:  Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure.  Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests around the world might come under attack. Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult  but he did not see the U.S. Attack significantly affecting oil prices. IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf.  If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait  no other country can either  and this would be to everyone's harm   the radio quoted him as saying."

"2","The Soviets have not indicated anurgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer  and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told Reuters. In an exclusive interview with Reuters  Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.  Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).  When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit  Lyng said   No  I don't think so. I don't think that.  The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit.  It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about   Lyng said.  When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it's not presidential   Lyng said. Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world  volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow. The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year  Lyng said  but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement.  We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss.  When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement  Lyng said   I don't know. It certainly hasn't been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement."
"2","The United States and India havenot yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.  We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance   Lyng said.  At this point  there is no detailed plan or program. The amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable   he said. There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419 of an amended 1949 law. Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid  and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food.  The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot  of taking care of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that   Lyng said.  We (the United States) obviously  with the surpluses we still have of many commodities...  would like to share in the import business the Indians do  and then we have some  as we always do  compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them   he said. Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials during Gandhi's visit here  adding   I just don't know of anything that might be announced specifically.  Asked if  the ball was in the Indians' court   he said   Yes.  Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening."

There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada  the United States  Japan  Britain  West Germany  France and Italy)   he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting.  There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system. Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer  interest rates have been dropping   Wilson said.  The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets. I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries   Wilson said.  This has been going on during the course of yesterday  through the evening and this morning and this will continue   he said.  What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economies...looks good   Wilson said."
"2","Switzerland will use most of its budgetsurplus projected for 1988 to redeem its debt  the Finance Ministry said. The government's plan calls for income to exceed expenditure by 1.3 billion Swiss francs next year. After internal transfers  net income was seen reaching 637 mln francs. The ministry said in a press release the surplus would be used  for the most part for redeeming debt  but also help finance environmental protection  public transport and research and development projects.  Thanks to the favourable liquidity situation  debt will be able to be repaid   the ministry said.  That will reduce the net interest burden to 2.2 pct of net income  the lowest point since 1974.  Finance Minister Otto Strich said the government plans to continue its tight fiscal policy as it moves toward its goal of reducing taxes. In the meantime  it will concentrate on redeeming its debt  he said in a statement.  In that way the interest payment burden on state finances can be reduced and the government's ability to set policy broadened   he said."

At the same time Fitzwater welcomed the action of major banks in rescinding increases in the prime interest rate."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month  although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal.  We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway   Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains  and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years  and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However  the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism  Lyng said  The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.   I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.  Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started.  All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us   Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils  he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC. The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz  recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture."

"2","The Brazilian Coffee Institute(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated  an IBC spokesman said. He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance  25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction. Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1  1985  and September 30  1987  to be used for calculating the export performace portion. The IBC will total all the figures  calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas  the IBC spokesman said. He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form. Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week  opening registraions from Monday. A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels  the spokesman added. A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota."

"2","Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint against Japan  expected soon  may influence the U.S. stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas. The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the U.S.  These are quota items  and the principles that apply to them  it seems to me  will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus   Lyng told Reuters in an interview. He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31  next year. The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste  some cheeses and specialty fruit juices. U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman. The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas  which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers.  We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT  Lyng said. He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said the United States will continue its policy of subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is a global agreement to end such subsidies. In an interview with Reuters  Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.  Yes  I'm troubled with that a little bit   he said.  There's no question about it  the longer you feed the calf on the cow  the longer it is to wean it.  In recent months  USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries. Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies  just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy  and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP.  I'm sure there's an end to the expansion  but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we've lost  to keep our products competitive and to let those  particularly the European Community  who  we are convinced  are the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization  that we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to some agreement to put an end to it   he said."
"2","U.S. commodity markets should notsuffer any long-term ill effects from Monday's financial turmoil  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.  I think traditionally that commodity markets have moved separately from the equity shares  so I wouldn't think that this would have any long-term effect   Lyng told Reuters in an interview. Most commodity futures prices declined on Monday  some sharply  largely in response to plummeting stock prices. Many futures prices rallied on Tuesday."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the recent dispute between the United States and West Germany over economic policy was responsible for much financial turmoil and that it should never have happened. He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important between finance ministers of the major nations. He said the dispute was a row which should not have happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised West Germany for having raised its key interest rates."
"2","The United States appears to have won atransatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates  European economists said. But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt  according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released  the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct  down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl  the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly  signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.  It's round one to the Americans    said Richard Reid  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London. But Reid added   We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point.  Over the weekend  criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US  Japan  West Germany  Britain  France  Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday  the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff  chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.  The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes  then all the better   he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise  and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U.S.  Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating  economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said  The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.  Before the IMF meeting  when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed  the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct  Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit  Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. In addition  both the U.S. And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar."
"2","The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group  EC officials said. Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers  Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat  fish and cereals by-products. But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again  the officials said. The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef. Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes  but they were outvoted by the other states  the officials said. Under the deal  Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4 500 tonnes to 34 300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3 000 tonnes to 53 000 tonnes. Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5 000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550 000 tonnes of wheat bran  the officials said. The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership. Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada. Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation. Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports  to improve tariffs for some other farm produce  to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists:  We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough.   We hope that there will be an improvement   he said."

"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the collapse of British share prices this week held no implication so far for domestic interest rates. He said in a television interview that  there is nothing in the events of the past few days to increase the upward pressure on (U.K.) interest rates.  Sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis  backed by strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lending rates  analysts said.

"2","Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said hewas surprised by recent criticism of West German economic policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but added that the criticism was not purely one-sided. Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday   There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United States).  He added.  Criticism is not a one-way street.  He did not elaborate  but Bonn has often called on the U.S. To reduce its federal budget deficit. Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic policies  saying that rises in domestic interest rates here were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to stabilise currencies. Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with Baker had resolved differences between the two countries. At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms  but he had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday   one remark or another has been clarified."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said there is more confidence in British financial institutions than in U.S. Equivalents  so there is no need for an official statement that the Bank of England will provide liquidity to the U.K. Financial system.  Our institutions are in a stronger position  I think  and the state of confidence is very much higher in this country so I see no need for the Bank of England...To make any statement of that kind   he said in an interview on Channel Four television. Earlier a pledge to provide such liquidity from U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan reassured world markets. Lawson said the Bank of England also saw no reason to provide such reassurance. The Bank of England had earlier declined comment. Analysts said Greenspan's pledge that the Fed would stand behind the U.S. Financial system reassured markets that the current turmoil should not spill over into the rest of the economy through a crisis in a financial institution caught out by heavy equity price losses and bond price volatility."

There was speculation that Reagan would meet with Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan at 4 PM EDT  which was when the reception was to have taken place."
"2","Sen. John Heinz  R-Pa  urged theAdministration to take steps to reduce volatility in the financial markets  including suspending program trading and limiting daily trading on stock index futures. Heinz said margin requirements for index futures  now six pct  should be the same as for common stock and equities. He urged creation of a task force to be headed by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker to coordinate international credit and montary policies among major nations and stabilize interest rates at the lowest possible levels."
"2","Commerce Secretary C. William Veritycalled for stepped up coordination of the major industrialized nations along the lines of the Venice pact last June which committed the nations to coordinate economic policies. Verity  speaking to a trade conference of the Overseas Private Investment Corp.  said  We must improve coodination with our major industrialized allies and trading partners along the lines agreed to at the Venice meeting last June. He added  we need better cooperation among advanced developing countries in assuring responsibility to coordinate local economies commensurate with their economic resources."
"2","President Reagan was meeting thisafternoon with his top economic advisers on developments in the stock market and the White House said he would issue a statement at 1700 EDT. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan met in the White House residence shortly after the market closed with Treasury Secretary James Baker  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan  Chairman Beryl Sprinkel of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and chief of staff Howard Baker. Reagan scrubbed a reception for Republican presidential candidates to make room in his schedule for the meeting."
"2","Secretary General Javier Perez deCuellar has proposed an impartial inquiry into the causes of the Gulf war while Iran and Iraq observe a ceasefire  diplomatic sources said on Tuesday. His nine-point plan  a refinement of proposals he took to Tehran and Baghdad last month  was delivered to the two sides last week with a request that they let him have their initial views before October 30. The proposals appeared to counter Iran's earlier offer of an undeclared cessation of hostilities if an inquiry into responsibility for the war was begun. Iraq insisted on a formal unconditional ceasefire  Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council on his return to New York on September 16. As in his original proposals  the revised plan termed D-day a specific date to be agreed upon for the observance of a ceasefire  diplomats said. On a specific date after that  which would have to be agreed  the withdrawal of all forces to internationally recognized boundaries would begin and be completed within an agreed time frame  according to the account of his proposals."
"2","As official Washington sought torestore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street collapse  Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis. Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson  British Chancellor of the Exchequer  was among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday   I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That  I think  was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.  It was a dispute that should never have happened  he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday  he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks   His timing could not have been worse.  One government bond salesman in New York said   He actually thought that yelling at the Germans  and threatening to smack the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.  However  some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.  On the surface Baker may look responsible for this  but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets)  it was West German policy   said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York.  All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public  so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger   he said. After Monday's talks  the U.S. and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord  pieced together in Paris in February  was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values. Treasury sources said that Baker  already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving  was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery  inching along in its 59th month  could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports. Moreover  Baker  the consummate politician  was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.  There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy  and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly  or else obviously the panic will feed on itself  and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically   former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview. In many ways  the official response was mild. Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was  puzzled.  U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and  presumably  their political impact. For all of this  it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall. Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat  Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony   Oh  I think it's much too late to be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do that."
"2","President Reagan said he was pleasedwith the actions of some banks to reduce their prime lending rates today and said he sees room for a further decline in interest rates.  I believe there is room in the market for a further decline in interest rates   Reagan said in a statement as he left the White House to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic advisers. Reagan said he remains concerned about the market  but that actions taken by the Federal Reserve have helped.  Interest rates are down across the spectrum   Reagan said.  Specifically  I am pleased that the bond market is strong and that foreign exchange markets are stable   Reagan said."
"2","President Reagan said he had orderedthe administration to begin talks with congressional leaders on a budget deficit reduction plan. Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers that he was prepared to order across the board spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budget law  but preferred to negotiate with Congress. He said he would consider anything the congressional leadership proposed  but a spokesman said he remains opposed to raising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit.  I think it is preferable  if possible that the executive and legislative branches reach a budget deficit reduction package. Accordingly  I am directing that discussions be undertaken with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress for that purpose   Reagan said. Asked whether he would consider raising taxes  Reagan said  I am willing to look at whatever proposal they might have.  As Reagan boarded the helicopter to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital  he was questioned as to whether that meant he was softening on his tax stance. Reagan replied  if you heard that it must have been the helicopter.  White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later told reporters that Reagan was not changing his opposition to tax increases. Fitzwater said the administration would accept automatic cuts under the Gramm Rudman balanced budget law rather than raise taxes. Earlier on Tuesday congressional leaders called for an economic summit with the White House to address the nation's budget and trade deficits that some analysts say were partly to blame for the stock market drop. Reagan said he would be willing to participate personally in any negotiations with Congress. The White House earlier seemed to reject the idea of negotiating with Congress on the budget deficit. Fitzwater said this morning that the White House continued to oppose a budget summit with Congress on the grounds that it would be used by Democrats as a platform to press for a tax increase. But Reagan announced his willingness to negotiate with Congress after meeting for about an hour with White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker  Treasury Secretary James Baker  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and chief economic adviser Beryl Sprinkel."
"2","The United States may lift anadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month  Reagan Administration officials said. President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets  hand-held power tools and portable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries  where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force  the officials said  until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement."
"2","President Reagan said the UnitedStates remains committed to the Louvre accord in which the seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency exchange rates.  The United States remains committed to the Louvre agreement   Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers. Reagan said the United States  Japan and West Germany had all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic policies. Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that  his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic relations with the United States.  Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre agreement. They  reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable exchange rates   Reagan said."
"2","Former Treasury Secretary William Simonsharply criticised President Reagan for irresponsible fiscal policies that contributed to this week's stock price collapse.  (Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxes without cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out of this ' and everything would be wonderful   Simon said  in an apparent reference to the massive U.S. budget deficit.  Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl with pain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today   he said in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeil Lehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT). Simon  who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford  said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment. And he blamed Congress for causing the U.S.'s fiscal problems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest.  It's not only the president. It's Congress ... under Republicans and Democrats alike   he said.  They're a bunch of hypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is 'more.'"
"2","The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backedPresident Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region. Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag. The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S. resolve that Iran  cannot take military action against the United States with impunity.  Earlier  the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy. The measure  however  does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act  which could lead to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf. While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S. retaliatory strike  many voiced new fears about the growing U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act."
"2","Monday's stock market collapse couldspell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the White House in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a general economic downturn -- political experts said.  The question is does the stock market (decline) signal an impending recession. If that is the case the Republicans will have a very difficult time winning   independent political analyst William Schneider told Reuters.  If the Democrats nominate anyone halfway credible they would win   he added. Schneider's comments  on the heels of a 500-point decline in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average  reflected the old political adage that elections are almost always decided by voters' feelings about their financial well being.  There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and we don't expect 1988 to be any different   says Donald Foley  the top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign. Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has shown amazing resilience and  there's no telling where the market will be by the end of the week.  President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events  but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.  I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy   he told reporters.  I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic indicators are solid   he added. But for the time being  the decline on Wall Street knocked the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy. It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument for keeping the White House in their hands when President Reagan leaves office in January 1989. It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White House race.  We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered to be the strongest in history   Bush said in reference to the recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's recorded history   Bush bragged. At midday  even as Wall Street was being battered by a record selling panic  Reagan gave a glowing account of the economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new Commerce Secretary  William Verity. Indeed  the Labor Department reported earlier this month that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an eight-year low of 5.9 pct in September  compared to seven pct a year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December 1982. But with interest rates climbing steadily and no improvement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world  a number of economic experts have expressed doubts about the staying power of the current expansion. Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year. And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy would be the determining factor in next year's election.  The 1988 election will be decided  as most peacetime elections are  on economic issues   said Michigan party chairman Richard Weiner.  In Ohio  people are uneasy. They want to know where the economy is going   added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo. American political history is replete with examples of voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority party for more than 40 years. But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on the 1988 election.  Times change  conditions change   Schneider said. Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel  Schneider added   Never make predictions  especially about the future."
"2","Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttersaid on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system. He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este  Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact  signed by two sides two weeks ago  has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts  other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market  they had better get serious about improving the GATT.  The pact with Israel  he said  is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said   increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.  He said   a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity  not only for advanced industrial nations  but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.  Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist  but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said   President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws  and I believe that veto would be sustained."
"2","News of a meeting between U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets  allowing the dollar to recoup much of the day's losses  dealers said. News of the meeting  which took place in Frankfurt in great secrecy  came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by Baker of West German monetary policy  which had provoked fears that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy. The dollar reacted immediately to the news  rising over two pfennigs in after hours New York trading  dealers there said. The announcement of the meeting  also attended by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl  was made simultaneously in Bonn and Washington  timed for after the closure of New York markets. Baker  Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the February Louvre accord  a finance ministry spokesman in Bonn said. The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of 1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks. The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest rates  and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord. Under the accord  leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability  with the surplus countries  West Germany and Japan  stimulating their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget deficit. West German government sources said rising West German money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50. German yields have also risen over this period  but less markedly  and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up short-term rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts  its principal instrument for steering the money market. The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth  which raised fears of domestically produced inflation  bank economists said. This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally  to the more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In an apparent gesture to Baker  coinciding with his visit  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S. anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.  They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much under American fire   said Chris Zwermann  currency adviser at Swiss Bank Corp here.  It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a significant retreat from its position   added Giles Keating  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London. The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact on Tuesday  and its result on Wednesday  money market economists said. Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation rate  which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility. The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place  although the Finance Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week. Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman  asked to comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre accord  went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue. The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit Denmark and Belgium."

After the meeting  a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels. The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing key interest rates  saying they were not in line with last February's Louvre accord."

After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels. The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing short-term money market interest rates.

Baker  Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency stability and monetary policy. Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into the West German money market in a move which money market dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary authority to curb interest rate rises. The spokesman described Monday's talks  which he called private  as very positive."
"2","A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate. The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote  virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year. A similar proposal has made no headway in the House. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package.  I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving American consumers the information they need   he said. Proponents of the measure  including the American Soybean Association  have claimed palm  palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease. The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils  imported primarily from Malaysia  Indonesia and the Philippines. But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter  who said the proposal  blatantly discriminates  against imports  would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines  Malaysia and Indonesia. Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils. The committee voted largely along party lines  with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure."
"2","European Community CommissionPresident Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in today's trading on world money and stock markets. He told a press conference here:  G-7 should meet discreetly and quickly.  Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the mark to levels around 1.60  the European Monetary System would undergo a  test by fire.  Delors said the current problems in the markets had been caused by excessive growth in financial trading  excessive deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing circumstances. He said it was  profoundly unjust  to blame it on recent increases in West Germany."
"2","U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakermet West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and agreed to support the Louvre pact  the Treasury Department said. The Treasury described the meeting as  a very positive  private meeting in Frankfurt  West Germany which had been agreed upon last week.  The parties agreed to continue economic cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible application including cooperation on exchange rate stability and monetary policies   the Treasury said. The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg  are consulting with their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.  The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven leading industrial countries including the United States and West Germany to promote currency stability. Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this week and the department earlier refused to release details of his travel itinerary  citing security considerations."
"2","President Reagan is concerned aboutthe record drop in stock prices but remains convinced on the basis of administration talks with financial experts that the economy remains sound  the White House said. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written statement that Reagan  watched today with concern  the decline on Wall Street  where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points. The statement said Reagan had directed administration officials to consult with leading financial experts  including the chairmen of the Federal Reserve  the Securities and Exchance Commission  and the New York Stock Exchange.  These consultations confirm our view that the underlying economy remains sound   Fitzwater said. The White House statement  issued about 45 minutes after the stock market closed  appeared designed to calm investors worried about U.S. economic propects.  We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history. Employment is at the highest level ever. Manufacturing output is up. The trade deficit  when adjusted for changes in currencies  is steadily improving. And  as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has recently stated  there is no evidence of a resurgence of inflation in the United States   Fitzwater said.  He said Reagan was keeping close watch on the markets in the United States and in countries  where waves of selling developed on Monday.  We will continue to closely monitor these developments   Fitzwater said. However  his three-paragraph statement gave no hint of what  if any  action Reagan might take if the stock market plunge continues. The percentage drop of 22.6 percent on Monday was the second largest ever  exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop on Dec. 12  1914.  It easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on Oct. 28  1929 which helped spark the Great Depression. Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis  which came on the same day American naval forces retaliated for last Friday's alleged Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flagged Kuwaiti tanker in the Gulf  at a White House issues luncheon. Presidential aides told reporters after the luncheon an official statement was likely to be issued when the markets closed."
"2","Canada's economy is strong and the outlookremains positive despite the sharp fall of stock prices on Canadian and other exchanges  Finance Minister Michael Wilson told the House of Commons.  I look with some confidence in the performance in the economy...I think we have a sound economy in Canada   Wilson said in response to opposition party questions. Wilson  noting the relative stability in the Canadian exchange and bond markets  rejected opposition demands to take some form of action.  There has been both quite good stability in both the (currency) exchange and bond markets this morning and I don't see any reason why we should try to take action that's anticipating somethnng which might not happen   Wilson said. The Canadian dollar held steady around the 77 U.S. mark today while the Toronto Stock Exchange's composite index was off 292.20 points to 3 306.40 in late trading Monday."
"2","The European Community is willing tooffer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year  an EC commission spokesman said. He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq. EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones  the spokesman said. Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers. It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year. Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France  Britain  West Germany and Spain  the countries involved in the Airbus project."
