But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my system but on 5.25 disks.  I hate using 5.25 disks so I copied them over to high density 3.5's using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In fact for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer when you're switching printer emulations around. Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with but when a friend's system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the originals and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton c:\nu would create a workable backup and if you did a full install the first time you've got the whole thing.

Thanks. A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible however to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip also available on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the normal keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

Gawd it's only been two and half years. How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck??? Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed?

"1","I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB. When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 everything is fine but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows AutoCAD GIFs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4 bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back this is a pain in the ass and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So if anyone has had this same problem please let me know if you know what to do.  Hell let me know if you don't have a solution just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance. Jude M. Greer jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen it just starts to cut off the top and bottom."

"1","Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in. Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it. It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then maps the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can cd to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor! So I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-) John -- John Gayman WA3WBU UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH"

At least : locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and : he has to fix it. Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell.

Kinda fun.  8) First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom. Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 If the last 3 digits are 013 you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (- represents jumper) >	W1	1-2 3 >       W2      1-2 3 >	W3	1-2 >	W4	1 2-3 >	W5	1 2 3 >	W6	1-2 3 >	W7	1 2 3 Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: (8 represents jumper) Looks right. [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other? I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom set it like this: 5 + +    open 6 + +    open 7 + +    open 8 + +    open 4 + +    closed 3 + +    closed 2 + +    open 1 + +    open Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 34 and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 12 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1). If you have the 62-000094 rom it's a auto-config and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here. >2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly? See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also  at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251 try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade? Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter: -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt) This will return the rom date if it's of any use. >Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above I appologize.

WD1004A-27X feature F300R - Half-slot size hard disk controller  with an ST506/ST412 interface.  It supports 2 RLL drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built-in ROM BIOS supports non-standard drive types virtual drive formatting bad track formatting and dynamic formatting. NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not boot.  To solve this problem one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using). -2- NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1 WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers models SX TX and the original or A version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5 the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the modification a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

"1","Help.... I need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3 and COM4. I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4 shares IRQ3 with COM2 except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how. Please answer by email to :- neil@stone.oz.au thanks in advance Neil Watkinson."

"1","Hi All I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters et.c. Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non-trivial data to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off typeamatic specs.) from inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above which wouldn't look too neat besides what would one do from an XT?) Great thanks in advance Andrew."

"1","Please help if you can with the following strange problem: The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to time for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or something the like). Unfortunately I cannot just reproduce the error. Sometimes it occurs more often sometimes less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to demonstrate some software to a colleague. I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it.

"1","Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer configuration is : 486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz) 16MB Ram ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk SCSI UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk performance in that system do I need that ? A guy I know gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec and he has an ST3283A and a ISA 486DX-50 how can a ISA with the same system be faster ? Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?

If you are considering buying one or the other definitely go for the DX with a nice size external cache!  The performance is far greater. The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz while the DX has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither systems could actually run a program out of main memory since DRAM is still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ). -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I can tell you that mixing them between 'banks' ok and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ) here is the two equivalent configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM interface they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry if too techie for ya]. MG>> 	Similarly one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots) can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ?? That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit wide SIMMs you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask? Simple  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit CPU ( 386DX or 486 ) the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data from memory ) is 32-bits wide so the computer expects to see 32 bits when it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ) the motherboard links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data but parity so I will ignore that in this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you have a 16-bit bus two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide data which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide and 32-bit banks are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bits used in some PS/2s and ASTs ) you could upgrade by one SIMM at a time. Hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your question was not simple.  I could of just said 'because I said so.' -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean cache speed is one thing but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O so just get that faster... I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)! regards JV ///// name:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ] address: gildelaar 4                                            \_=_/ 4847 hw teteringen                                     _| |_ holland                  e-mail:  volkert@kub.nl      / \_/ \ _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__"

No rumour IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last fall (COMDEX or something I wasn't there). All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU just like 486SX that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel don't you? It has 16K of internal cache which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99 but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software"

Try another vendor I wish I had. While others here may have had better experiences I too share the sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM it is only relatively recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing mis-drawn check boxes etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01. If there's a more recent release I'd appreciate if someone would drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their BBS lately to check again.  Naturally Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases. Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the right person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not confirmed the validity of that statement. When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some form of local bus) I'll seek a video solution from someone other than Diamond.

"1","Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS using C++ to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085. I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character if a 0x20 is received the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17 monitors (also a newly available) and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board. Do not buy a 486SX sytem. My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models. Gordon"

"1","Howdy Sorry if this has been covered before: One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course I said No problem and went to work. Unfortunately the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC)... Thanks in advance Paul Mr. SCSI... NOT! Fincke"
"1","I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am running Linux as my main OS with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games. My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS and (120+100)Mbyte IDE. Basically I have two choices 1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486. Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25. I have a couple of questions. 1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS and alot of Floating Point operations. 2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ? Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? Any experiences will be most helpful ... Kenny. PS.

Does he have to use new parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? When it comes to local dealers: - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their techs are re-treaded salesmen not trained technicians with a high turnover rate. - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously. - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply or even done period unless you are on a paid service contract. Having been both a service technician and a service manager at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place I know what I'm talking about. I also know the local service scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service. Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service including overnight replacement parts on-site calls etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good service you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can. - Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)"

Some background about my PC: - American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM - config.sys file: device=c:\dos\himem.sys dos=highumb device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems files=30 buffers=30 stack=9256 - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c - CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram. The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31 I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. Run excel no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows. Ok I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them: - Stack fault by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure by ndw.exe at same address Some how the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means? I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat no help. Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. -------------- Steve Chu AT&T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ"

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use slower RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash. Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM. Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of Illinois Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set. Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels? If you have not yet open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base. As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker? Anyhow If the tape has the holes then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape. If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out. If it is still in warranty you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair. --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil Standard disclaimer: The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

No help there. Then not having anything better to try I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards. I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila! the PC booted from power up although it seemed to take several seconds before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns. O.K. with this additional information does anyone in netland have any words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it? -Larry still (un)plugging away Byler-"

"1","Hello I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have 8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie. both banks are full and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows and I know that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS the only solution I can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180 and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather avoid... So my question is do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work how do they do it?  Is a device driver needed or will the BIOS pickup the extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits so probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly appreciated. -Eric ebosco@us.oracle.com"

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for! V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster. This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory. Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other two. How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.

If we are >only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently >faster at managing data from a hard drive. You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only} some monitors and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports. IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max. So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost} SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put."

It must be able to run Unix. What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a quality stuff? What are other important features ? Monitor: I want a 14 non interlaced svga but not sure about what brand to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider? Acer? Touch? What else should I ask? Video Card: I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of V-RAM? One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal? Hard Drive: Segate Western Digital Conner all have the same price. Which one is more liable? which one has better performace? Case/power supply: Given the choise of desktop and minitower which one is better? What is the adequate power supply? Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue? What features should I ask for? Did I miss anything? I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group. Your help is greatly appreciated. Jason Chen"

"1","I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well and is working fine but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup. The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0 The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head 300 write_pre 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally the drive in the machine had none.  Currently I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave. When booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error. Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive I would not even know how to do that. Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not a number for Western Digital might just do as good! swood -- Hunting over in Michigan?

The scenario: 1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller 2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy) 3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy) 4 - Call Gateway receive the correct controller in 5 days (getting happier) 5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again) 6 - Call Gateway again get another controller in 5 more days (cooling off the end is in sight) 7 - This controller doesn't work either motherboard is bad (VERY unhappy) Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) and have on-site service install it for me. BUT I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So the whole thing is going back. I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer. I would really like to try Gateway again I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?

"1","Hello I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec 1542A controller. Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located. Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system' even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).

Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software. Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS and later Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x the number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc. Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore IBM is including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1). Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2. So far IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read comp.os.os2.misc for details). Proposed Charters: (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and spur additional development.  The group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS Windows UNIX etc) toolkits which aid in program portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors) and so forth. (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting. (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics including the availability of device drivers compatibility information installation procedures system requirements and overall performance optimization. (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues. (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports bug diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system patches and corrective service disks and so forth. [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other newsgroups and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in comp.os.os2.beta] How to Vote: To cast your vote fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me. Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this post.  Be sure to send only the ballot and edit out the rest of this post. 1)  Type in your vote for each proposal: If you favor the charter as proposed put a yes after its name. If you oppose the charter as proposed put a no after its name. To abstain leave a blank after its name. 2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name) a comma and your first name (i.e. your personal name). 3)  Cut out the ballot  Please do not delete any lines of the ballot. 4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) April 24 1993. Ballot: ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---- (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: (f)       voter's last first name: e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24 ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---------------- Example Ballot #1: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no (f)       voter's last first name: Smith John In this example John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting to be created and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. Example Ballot #2: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes (f)       voter's last first name: Doe Jane In this example Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all the proposals. Voting Rules: * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once only the most recent vote will be counted. * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting forwarding posting votes to a newsgroup etc. will not be counted. * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings will be revealed only after the poll closes. * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will post the ACK twice (see Schedule below). * If you need help for using your editor using e-mail how voting works in general etc. then ask an expert at your site. Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is posted to news.answers on a regular basis. * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this CFV send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu. * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below) a proposal passes if both of the following formulas are true: 1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100 or YES - NO >= 100). 2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO or YES - NO >= NO). In other words a proposal passes if: YES - NO >= max (100 NO) where max() returns the highest number given to it. Schedule: The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator). This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV but it also has the Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you have not voted yet vote now! The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) on April 24 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count. The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that date. Mass Acknowledgement: Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15 1993: bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari Sanjay

"1","Hi I just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy.  This thing has every port known to man on the back. The question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC. What hardware is needed? Software? TIA Alex P.S. please respond directly.  I am not on this alias."
"1","I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced which seems like a good deal. However it is a fixed-scan rate monitor and only handles 52 kHz horizontal I think.

"1","While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts I found a half-size board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC and ran Advanced diagnostics several times changing the jumper positions each time but the system did not recognise a comm port. Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it? I could use another comm port if it's free. Bryan"

"1","Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say Buy the memory from us or something like that.) The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects. So to get to the point finally ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken. If you want these modes steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB) at least until their developers are less busy.  If the magazines are to believed I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?) although evenn that might be a misprint. Please if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL. Thanks. donyee@athena.mit.edu"

"1","> My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ 5 which is > unreserved in contemporary computers (using IRQ 5 for the > drives went out with the XT architechture ... ) Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt. On the other hand we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1 a Mouse on COM2 and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5 and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3 our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work. ~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)"

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.

"1","This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard. I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr 7 days/wk) and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company. I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc. Thanks very much in advance for any information. -- Mohammad Al-Ansari"

You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me believing that the 250 logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity. The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it marketing.

This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours particularly if the tape is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for the write is too small.

This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration file for the tape system.

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE inteface for any non-card non-modem not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross drive interfacing as fast as the OS program CPU SCSI and drive can handle it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}. In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well. Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers scanners expandsion cards {this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'} CD-ROM etc. IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface {Make of that what you will} SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE. This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water. Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago {When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI off into the statosphere price wise} SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces {at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}"

"1","Hi I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive. I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE drive. I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any mention of it in the manuals. My system config is: i486DX/33 4Mb Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE Any help would be appreciated Thanks Ron.

"1","It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick. I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features. For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy. Just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up down left etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know much beyond that. -- Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality Winnipeg MB Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinks chrstie@ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant. |  they're useful to society"

However just in case something went wrong I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly. * MSDOS configuration: The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive (this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up. * Windows configuration: To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows make sure that the [388Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry: VirtualHDIRQ=Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you you might want to try adding some more lines: VirtualHDIRQ=Off SystemROMBreakPoint=false EMMExclude=A000-CFFF (You probably don't need the above lines though.)  The SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs). * Windows 3.1 runs slowly: Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542 chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not it's probably because: 1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a winning solution. 2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen .... If your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 (SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS) you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other solutions. Unfortunately you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following: 1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by a bug in Smartdrive. 2. Use a driver that provides VDS services (VDS stands for Virtual DMA Services).  This is a standard which is supported by Windows 3.1 that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like the 1542) to work with Windows. After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following solutions none of which require using Smartdrive (note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster: 1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver or you do not need ASPI functions (for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc.) you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 (Windows needs the /V386 option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory) and it occupies about 16-20K.  As of November 1992 the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully it's still there). 2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver version 3.0 or 3.0a you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 Amazingly enough the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support about this and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW. On my system NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE the default Windows shell and vice-versa.  This is the reason SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary. I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0. Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider these people lucky.  Others like me have had all sorts of problems. 3. In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer needed.  Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know there are only three ways to get a copy: * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other drivers such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is around $75. * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around $30. * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1. Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem. ***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices: There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250: 1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc. 2. Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors. (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542.) * Tape backups/restores take a long time: If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 bus on/off timing for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause.  However the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary. The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is too large.  For example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory) not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough. The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on and 5 microseconds off. The bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways: * If you have ASPI4DOS you can use the /n option.  For example I use a bus on timing of 4 microseconds which means that I use the following line in my CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4 Note that there is NO space between the /n and the 4. * If you don't have ASPI4DOS your only recourse is to try to find a program called SETSCSI.EXE which is very difficult to find.  The reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have it.  If you do find a copy you run it like so: setscsi -n:4 This adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds.  Running SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults. Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS however. Do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little. Once you've lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster. Also do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described) unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh. A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while) this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However when I tried running this program with my 1542A my system crashed.  At the time I was running SCSIHA.SYS and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B although the docs say that it works with the 1542A? * Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors: This problem may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542. Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head: 1. Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup. 2. Tape backup works but the tape compare fails. 3. The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc. much too often. Unlike the above-mentioned problem (Tape backups/restores take a long time) where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so. 4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the tape drive but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot. 5. Too many tape read errors. Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago I upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542 I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive. I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542 which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542.  On the other hand the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542.  I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however if you're having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller. ***** Sound cards: Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error.  Usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware. I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g. higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using 16-bits instead of 8 etc.). Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's bus on timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note however that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e. some software is inefficient).  Disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this. ***** Miscellaneous info: This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk. * With QEMM 6.00 6.01 and 6.02 you need to specify the DB= parameter (e.g. DB=2) unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver. If you don't QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line (at least this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter but I'm not sure (I've never used a version earlier than 6.00). If you use ASPI4DOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB= parameter. * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB you need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec. * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542 you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package which lists for something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you need. 2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc.  I do not know the list price but I've seen this package sold for around $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS driver which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead. 3. [This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit but I'm mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver) if it is not included in the ASW-410 kit but this is available from several bulletin boards. * To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542 you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are (again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup. 2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more details).  However note that CorelSCSI! does not come with but requires ASPI4DOS. * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations: 1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS. 2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers. 3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and CorelSCSI! drivers/programs. I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration: 4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI drivers). * Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used this version of GNU tar but I've heard that it works (I don't know how well though).

However the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical and there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work with a 1542A but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of BSD Unix). * In case anyone's curious here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file: FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGHUMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.

"1","I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more you now get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago when I bought this pkg. it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos."

XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think).

"1","I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system: 486-33 DX 16 mb of ram on a Novell 3.11 network Monitor:  NEC 4FGe capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate Major considerations: I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word processing database and communications--not much intensive graphics. With a 15 monitor I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256 colors seems plenty but I'd like like the image to be sharp fast and rock solid. Other considerations: I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers. I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking. I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later).

Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning (the problem I had) others poor focus etc etc. I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. It's now clear well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly a Trinitron (say) would be much nicer but that's well out of my price range. Conclusion: If you're on a budget get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it but has good potential. Chris"

"1","------------------------------------------------------------------------- Netters! I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's but that's not really relevant at the moment. I've been offered the following CD-ROM players for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor please give your opinions on the drives i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq. I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

"1","I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4). Well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters. What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? -- ............................................................... :      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : : Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              : : Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park NC : ..............................................................."

Several others here also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate appears ok for me but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of spending money with the size of today's files etc a tape backup is certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost."

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find corrupted files but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? As might be expected I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything (and hoping that will fix the problem) but I would like to have some assurance of what the problem cause is. Also can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)?

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}. The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices slower through put} From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for 20% faster then IDE that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1 far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip. The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the 20% faster then IDE came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port electronic controller etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes. When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }"

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed 20% faster than IDE {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)} Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip {Not at a 6MB/s 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}. Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on. One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is (Digital Review Oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))."

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? : If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think) but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS. The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient. We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though). I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several. Gordon Lang"
"1","I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future Domain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller. The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices). The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found. The system hangs if all three (Tandberg Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system. Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.

I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many things about pc in general. So what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ? I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256 colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes. Any suggestion ?? thankyou in advance Paolo Silvera -- Certified Commodore Amiga developer silvera@ghost.sm.dsi.unimi.it"

"1","I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17 Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results. In going with the modern trend the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia though which the S3 cards just printed as hash which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported. The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic' and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either. The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386 ISA so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486 33 MHz AIR motherboard (UMC chipset) with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit. K means thousand (not 1024) M means million pixels per second Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me.... I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my company. geoff sherwood"

"1","Hi Netters! I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario: 1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive). The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / restore program.  Both systems have 3.5 and 5.25 floppies. 2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon). From what I have seen so far there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these options I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y etc.) in my thinking (I don't know very much about these beasts): 1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system. Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand? What do the floppies themselves cost? 2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again can someone recommend a few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)? 3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?) 4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again any gotcha's or recommendations for manufacturers? I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.

You send a command to the port to read it then you time how long it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously since time is used as a position you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste of time.

At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver. So should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number? Any assistance appreciated.

"1","Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again I forget the model number but I can find out.) Anyway I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected) but not both at the same time; whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master the new 210MB one is the slave). The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations: controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave None of them worked.  Unfortunately I can't think of any others. Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C: drive and D: drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things? So I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost! Many many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!

"1","Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up. Previously when I first start up my PC I can see all the CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again the display works as normal like before. Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet. I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.

My 2 cents worth: The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. A speaker being a coil it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach. Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard. LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light power off reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work. If it does then attach the turbo switch to the board. Hope this helps. Dan Moyer Dan.Moyer@ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM"

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something much more elementary. Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and an initial directory. If you have a small disk (50 meg or less) I would recommend that it remain a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

No that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper. : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.

No actually we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.

On a single drive SCSI is more expensive.  But you bought your PC for expandibility so you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE: A (partial?) list: 1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently. 2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) 3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For instance recently I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will work no other way.  On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes. 4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once. One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full but it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card. Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE.

Anyway he now he would like to put another HD into this system.  I DON'T want to buy another MFM the only reason why I used an MFM in the first place is that it was FREE.  Would I need a special IDE HD controller?  Also if I do need a special IDE controller where can I purchase one & how much are they?

If the keyboard is left idle in Dos for more than 15 minutes I can type on the command line but as soon as I hit a carraige return the computer locks up.  This will happen almost every time whether I've just booted up reset or finished using a dos program.  Everything works fine if I don't let it sit.  Windows is a different story.  If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes or more it does not freeze up.  However  I do get frequent application errors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly losing my work.

"1","I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k ( v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem at the other machine is a Turbomodem+ from The Complete PC (the machines are in seperate houses so a direct serial link is impossible and copying this much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines on for a few hours and go see a movie--no this is not pirated software). I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to set the comm at 19k2 38.4k or 56kbps the stupid thing connects but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k). His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART so that's not the problem. It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to a comm program _at_ 14.400bps even though it will take dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK etc. to other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can do precisely 14.4k. I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it any way in particular? Also it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting here (i.e. at 9600 since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far) but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.

(at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms. Is there any argument that IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. If data is going from one drive to another and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?

If they had a common (read: >easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or >Mac) then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice. So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice. >: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented >: data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better >: (than IDE on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when >: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. > >On a single drive SCSI is more expensive.

(jumpers set IRQ 14/15 hw port addr 1F0/170 and BIOS addr CC00/C800 and other floppy/format stuff) Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI or even from HD is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - ---  --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron and can change a chip or put a jumper!

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents... The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems. A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or at least do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group. Its a long story but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines.  If and when SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines I plan to completely get rid of IDE. -- Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best. Palm Bay FL.

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it but DOS (at least) won't.

Since my budget is $2350 for a system it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it IS too good to be true of course). Among other things I've never seen a review of the Budget systems (or their parent company Micro Smart) or of the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be appreciated. In a similar vein the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14 MI monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well. Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities. Email response would be greatly appreciated.

This is what all this is about.  Do you >get more performance for the money. Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: >IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s. Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower {Range 0-5MB/s} >ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {}) PC Magazine April 27 1993:29 Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE... {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI one third the speed of IDE... or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI 20% faster than IDE... NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity. SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)} If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2} IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE."

The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives and monitor.  The floppies are 360k and the monitor is CGA but you will need an adaptor cable to use it.

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk and REM out the Adaptec drivers. Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work. Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun. The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

"1","Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5. (The card is revision 5A) My detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part of the ISA bus. The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X what does the manual claim that this jumper does? To anyone with an ISA-reference what is the function of the BALE line? On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?

I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor.

If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only work as the first or second drive.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I have seen a similar situation before.

Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will > allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts? Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software) COM1 on IRQ3 SoundBlaster on IRQ5 LPT1 on IRQ7 and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great. If you need even more there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus. It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the first IRQ serviced by the system giving the modem a better response -- especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

With I/O overlap your CPU can continue to think while disk operations are underway whereas without overlap your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity* compared to a fast CPU. So when you've got multi-tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do. One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes with no DMA. -- Richard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along..."

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence IDE *is* ISA on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock 16 bit width 5MB/sec. This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way then it's not compatible.

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned they are adjusted to factory-spec before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15 monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps rough handling and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor (the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my case quite :). >Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? I for one was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect IMHO but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was normal). The short answer is no don't accept these imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors one has a right to expect higher quality and if you're persistent you'll receive it. >............................................................... >:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : >: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              : >: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park NC : >...............................................................

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from? SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip the port and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point. SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY} asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s} synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.} SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s} SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external device. Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2. Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst. SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this requires: SCSI-2 driver software wide SCSI-2 port and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software the controler chip and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}"

"1","Hi I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone claims..) Anyway.. 1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use.. 2) Secondly does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ?? 3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8) 4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... For instance using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary... I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll suspect not .. 5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant?????? As a follow on does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls 0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to screen memory in terms of portability? Many thanks.. Gotta go bars closing soon 8) Cheers Ian"
"1","Fellow netters I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices. Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also. Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE. I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149). Basically I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy? If you have a hand scanner please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. - Kevin Harter"

Reamy (mreamy@rock.concert.net) >The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon. One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao the F550iW which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows I reviewed several monitors including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi and it scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect. Incidentally one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product whether it's monitors or mice is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done and on what the scores are based you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring. Wayne Rash"

There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems so you'll have to get it from someone else. However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know the speed buffering works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board. Hope this helps...

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time. Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense."

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways so there probably isin't a problem with this) Besides like I said before the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2.

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very poorly written.

Very possibly but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is. From what I've seen the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz intelligent bus (ie bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like not jumpers...)

"1","Greetings Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension) and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386. The station has a power supply two floppy disk drives and the big case. I have SONY 1304 monitor SyQuest drive (Mac) and maybe a cd-rom reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW I need to buy a keyboard for it too. Any input is welcome. Thank you. Peter Liu"

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called. Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock). Mark Aitchison University of Canterbury."
"1","Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and pronounced the disk drive unusable. My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders 9 sides). When CMOS set this way COMPSURF runs happily with 13 bad blocks. I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive. Install will proceed successfully but when I try to boot the server it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware. Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit). Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors. Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk yes? So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured? 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides. Thanks for your time. Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before.

"1",">How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus? By initiating a DMA xfer.  :) Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower). ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or crash.(I forget) Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit. The system uses DMA 0 a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1. I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA. In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers. I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either. I do know that on EISA/MCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel. Thanks."
"1","They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use IRQ7!. The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7 then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7. Note this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!. Windows may be a different story...."

"1","Hai In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard. It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is. I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around. My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it so I consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things: - How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2 Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example) - What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it support (text & graphics) - How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM - Compatibility with old TSENG 4000 - Support in software If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell me about it. For the people in Holland: Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam! Thanks in advance			Erik Stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)"

Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day. You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips memory etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save a few cents here and there in electricity bills but it won't look like much when it come time to fix your computer. My $.02 worth.. N. Ngo"

"1","Hi all I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is: * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD * SCSI(2) Interface * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B * Does not need any caddies * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible) * Double Speeded I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions are sorted by my priority. I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive but it DOES satisfy almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible with 1542B adapter. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance KobayashiMasaoki (masaoki@tky.hp.com)"

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance I'll be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards arrive I'll buy one. >Personally my system at home needs a new disk subsystem a much >larger monitor a super-fast graphics board by you-know-who a new >CPU board -- I probably won't keep much more than the case and the >mouse.

My case has slots for 8 and I'd like to : get a scanner but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out! : I'm hoping that a simple solution exists e.g. an adapter that turns I'm not sure if this will work but how about using one of those 'T' expanders used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot and then (probably) have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low profile cases - a standard motherboard the 'T' connector in one slot and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more. The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics on it.  The only downside - your case won't close but for a homebrew system that may not be a problem. Don't know about performance though.

"1","Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine and very nice it is too. One query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz - thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its 7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button that turns it into a skateboard. Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of turbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of about 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.

I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed. I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem as though it's cranking along at much more than that but I also don't know if I could tell the difference.

It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec. I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM RLL and IDE drives because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives much more than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST-01/02."

Yeah there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA XT ISA and now even MCA but at all times it was a 16 bit standard running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI ESDI whatever none of them run at CPU speed. The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much much better to get a software disk cache instead since you get write-caching as well. >because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

"1","I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation is no help at all. As an example it says 'The serial port can be changed to COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-( There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G The second bank is labeled IRQ and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the G enables the game port and the S2 SHOULD enable the second serial port but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports but I don;t know how.

I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory and I noted the following memory timings on my machine: ASQ v1.30 by Qualitas  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  Mon Apr 19 1993  11:43:49AM    page: 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCESS TIMING Hex     KB     KB   Access Speed Ratio (%) Start  Start   Size  Time us 0   25   50  75  100 00000      0     32      396 ****************** 00800     32     32      598 ***************** 01000     64     32      157 ******************** 01800     96     32      180 ******************** 02000    128     64      157 ******************** 03000    192     32      165 ******************** 03800    224    128      156 ******************** 05800    352     96      169 ******************** 07000    448     32      153 ******************** 07800    480     32      188 ******************** 08000    512     96      158 ******************** 09800    608     32      171 ******************** 0A000    640     96     1221 ************** 0B800    736     32     1581 ************ 0C000    768     32      312 ******************* 0C800    800     96      154 ******************** 0E000    896     64     3957 * 0F000    960     64      312 ******************* Note two things on this chart: 1) The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than system memory.

Here's the deal:  The thing works fine!  It low level formats etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN... (Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes. Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: Ok NDD's just not being thurough enough I'll use Spinrite I heard that works well. What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!! AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while only to return in a day or so. I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD and I really can't afford it. I'm using SMARTDRIVE and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access though I know that can create problems).

Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.

Nowhere do I see anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual: Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of 3.75 MB/s maximum 1.87MB/s minimum.  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87 sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside) Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected 'on-the-fly' in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.  (I take this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck) For page-mode operations the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching I guess you could call that a cache :-|). So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec??? Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com. > which one is better? mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same. When I ran dos I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6 this advantage is gone because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put device=pf.sys in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and such also if that is of any value to you.

"1","Hi Netters As promised here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ) so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. However it seems that at $39.95 it is quite a buy. Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance. Here is my suggestion... 1)  If you do not have any compression software currently I would go with DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS) plus the other utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides you are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...) 2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do) the cost is $29.95 for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net I decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It works great.  Not delays.  I think the A is better than B arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. I am looking forward to being able to LOADHIGH the DD sw.  That has been an annoyance. 3)  If you have Stacker et.al. currently I would not see it worth the effort to upgrade. Just my $.02 ... Regards Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was in my opinion easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly. There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such). I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper. -Bruce -- Bruce F.

Software Technical Support Engineer |               Sam Gamgee Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.   |      <My mail My Opinions> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on a 486DX 33Mhz 120MB Seagate drive running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced mode. I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files. If you have any more specific questions let me know.

(if you are familiar with Insight you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms) but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah yes one of the drawbacks of OEM!). Other questions: - Excuse my ignorance but is Texel a reputable maker in the CD-ROM market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive? - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently $449 for the TA-1000 and $699 for the TA-2000) Alternatively I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however I *do* want full multimedia capabilities Photo CD stuff educational programs for my kids etc.) and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful like a tape back-up drive unit.

"1","[] These LPT1 COM1 disk controller are call devices.  There are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership eg. disk controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership ie. it will share an interrupt with another device eg. LPT1 No.  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7 then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's because they're implemented by a single card. -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)"

Higher vertical resolution >was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have >and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8 and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested though take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file run the P9000 installation program INST and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514 as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists etc. >Interestingly the solid >vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie >filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the Bart Simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.

"1","Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it was version 1.5 build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!). One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now and I have tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said: Well Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.  Anyway I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

"1","Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems: 1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations: a) Under NDW when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an Open menu) and then is deselected a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be. b) With Word for Windows when you use shading in a table the display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example if you shade the cell as 10% the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command) and the debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed to do). The screen goes haywire and is largely unreadable. The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled. Through trial and error I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter R. This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen and it does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this. The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode. The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). --- swh 20apr93"

(Well you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies but don't count on be able to do so!)

"1","I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm hoping someone knows what this board is or even better what the various switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches 2 banks of 4 switches and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined by following traces that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3 SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4 and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number but it is blank. Immediately below the words SERIAL NO but not in the box left for the S/N are the numbers 1990 2 8. Anyone have any clues?

My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But : for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these. Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your IDE drive does not have a label then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle is center polarized that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side then you can identify pin 1 as follows: look into the pins with the notch at the top pin 1 is at the top right.  On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins 39 & 40 (the oposite end) then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1. : Secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the master drive : and which into the Slave?  any help appreciated.  thanks... It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine then you can usually get voice help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be able to help you). Good Luck Gordon Lang"

That makes real sense. Actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence. The floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr by the way) really does stink. Wally Bass"

Apparently the clock >hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The >Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then >then advances the date. > >Anybody with more info? There are two 'problems': (1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit for day increment so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the meantime and (2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date' call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to increment the date the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time) and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL) there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly though the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time because DOS is not reentrant and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.

You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor than an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA then using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-) As for graphics cards assuming that the Atari monitor can be modified/adapted to handle VGA signals you should probably be able to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't tried this but that would be my guess... Robert Anisko anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com ...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper to go that route than to do the conversion; besides with the Falcon and beyond VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go..."

The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master. In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics. There are four links LK1 LK2 LK4 and LK5 adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector. LK2: LED When fitted this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130 Ohms ot 220 Ohms. LK1: Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector indicating to the Master drive the presence of a Slave. LK4: Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way. LK5: IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per second. There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered: Master single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted. Master single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted. Master dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted. Slave dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted. Master dual drive with LED on interface		LK4 LK1 & LK2 fitted. Slave dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted. The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used. The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further details. ***************************   S E A G A T E   ************************* There is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM SCSI ESDIand IDE) on every Simtel mirror under /msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip It contains info about the following drives: st1144a	st138a	    st274a	st3283a st1057a     st1156a	st1400a     st280a	st351ax st1090a     st1162a	st1401a     st3051a	st9051a st1102a     st1186a	st1480a     st3096a	st9077a st1111a     st1201a	st157a	    st3120a	st9096a st1126a     st1239a	st2274a     st3144a	st9144a st1133a     st125a	st2383a     st325ax *********************	T E A C   ************** Model: SD-3105 Cyls.

"1","I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says the board is a 391 WB/H.  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card. Anyway that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays Parity Error -- System Halted messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to disabled or enabled in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?). I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures). I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order making sure that the connections were solid. My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card or to the motherboard (God forbid). CAN ANYONE HELP? Thanks Peace David Geller gelldav@elof.acc.iit.edu"

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a physical layer concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address it is most definetly changable.  But it is strictly software. Gordon Lang"

"1","Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade old 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a 16MHz 386 can be transformed into a 32MHz 486 with a single chip upgrade.

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5 that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS) my HD refuse to boot. Just my 2 cent. Jim"

"1","Hello I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ but couldn't find the answer. Anyway... The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is in my opinion still the best keyboard around.

Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. > > Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): > > The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape. ^^^^^^^^^^ It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200 I think) My question is: Does anybody use this product if yes how many bytes REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite unbelievable to me).

"1","I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). Well does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow!

"1","Hi everyone I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program. When I compile the program it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I can't seem to explain why it crashes. All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing. Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything?? I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup I will gladly re-post but this is the only I could find. Thanks in advance Sean Mars Email mars@carroll1.cc.edu Carroll College Waukesha WI"
"1","You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it's enabled and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory as well as the simms. The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your IDE controller also. Anyway perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better. mrb boltz@vivaldi.psu.edu mrb118@psuvm.psu.edu"

I've done some ASIC and digital design but not any CPU design. It would seem to me that on a 486 the FPU is not being used most of the cache is not being accessed the off chip buffers/drivers are idle the multiplier isn't multiplying the barrel shifters aren't shifting microcode isn't microcoding etc.  This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS) which means less heat.\ From what I understand the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power. -- Dennis Lou             || But Yossarian what if everyone thought that way? dlou@ucsd.edu          || Then I'd be crazy to think any other way!

If you ran dos you don't need a 16550 because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer.

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery. If however your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change though. It's also possible but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay get a virus scanner and check out your system."

It's also using IRQ 2) I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that explains how to sort this out but with no manual I don't know the Bboard number. If you can please help me with as many of the following as possible: a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668) c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can magicly get everything working. Any help at all would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance Red/."

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE 2 SCSI disk and 1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card but I also have a Future Domain a Western Digital SCSI card and I work with an ADAPTIC before.  As I recall all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. However to use with other controller (IDE MFM...) the boot drive has to be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE 1 SCSI). just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it. Then set up the SCSI controller (IRQ DMA etc). Set the SCSI drive to ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on.  If you have more question email me I will try to answer it. Good Luck! William"

Since installing DOS 6.0 when I tried to re-install software from 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks when I mount the second..third..fourth disks DOS 6 doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a DIR I see the contents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize that diskettes have changed is to do a label and then to not label them. Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable and worked well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro and DESQVIEW/X ( with QEMM Manifest etc) so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using.

But does anyone have a controller for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going? How about for an EISA machine?

The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems but you should still check your software! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels the connector type the pinouts and the signal protocols.  The connector is a DB-25 but IBM has set an alternative standard of DB-9.  The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD) Recieve Data (RD) and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the connection has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined but they are obsolete.  I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows: Name    DB-9     DB-25 SG       5        7 TD       3        2 RD       2        3 DTR       4       20 DSR       6        6 DCD       1        8 RTS       7        4 CTS       8        5 RI       9       22 Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE) there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert the CTS DSR DCD or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge or Lap- Link or Telix then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG TD and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio the question is do you need flow control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract escape codes but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair game.  Again you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more gotcha signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control if any can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection then I suggest you use this one.

"1","Hi: I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs! I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things: -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos) -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos) -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bits/pixel -	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of the images/data come from and is the most demanding of these tasks. I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup and decided that a nice system (price/performance) would be: 486DX-50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus 15 monitor 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise.  Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following configuration: 486DX-33 64k cache ISA 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+ 2 meg ram 14 monitor 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or been uncovered! There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish running the local window manager.  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it make a difference?  I'm hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice (above) for that reason. Also are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive controllers be they IDE or SCSI can transfer via DMA.  These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus your arguement makes no sense this isn't an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands. The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data. >>Its a long story but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which >>thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later when the device is done it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback.

(Assuming >a drive which needs formatting) Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it knows about. Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card sometimes you can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that you must use a third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor Disk Manager or the like. IDE drives come formatted already and since the is controller part of the drive mechanism itself concerns about geometry are irrelevant.

"1","In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80 you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100% if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a 20MHz 486SX then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and I will respond with a couple of sources.

I know Adaptec is good but they are kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also I have seen on the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the quantum? 2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable. Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive. 4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.

Ambiguous votes which cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is provided will be identified in the final vote tally. Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!! Rationale --------- The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library government and network usage and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not and ought not be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups. The reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics and between the two main focal points of software i.e. fulltext and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA CDI CD-R Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books copyright issues and other legal matters packaging distribution could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing in any format and is appropriate to the Internet. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as index and retrieval software premastering software cdrom simulation software hypertext sgml scanning and imaging software data capture software data clean up compression encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and video. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing as well as hardware for data capture such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom. Notes ----- These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan. Charter ------- Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.software will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: Index and retrieval software Authoring software Scanning and imaging software OCR and OCR cleanup Hypertext SGML Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.hardware will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: CD-R equipment Data capture hardware Scanners Video and audio capture hardware Networking hardware Midi hardware Photo CD hardware Publishing systems CDI and DVI hardware Compression and encryption hardware Keyboarding Other hardware publishing topics Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: Multimedia authoring software Imaging software Audio and Midi software Color control software Video editing software Audio editing software Multimedia utilities useful for publishers Integration of text image audio and video Compression and encryption of multimedia Multimedia copyright and related legal issues Multimedia databases and hypertext Other multimedia publishing topics -- Henry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu Brooklyn NY            * Disclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that of anyone else :-)  ????!"

"1","Serial cables: There are only three output signals: TD DTR and RTS. There are five inputs signals: RD DSR DCD CTS and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang"

Also the DX2/66 is faster in the operations that run off internal cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're having a GREAT Day! they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to. The details: I ordered one of their house brand Infotel 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem I would not have ordered it had I known this in advance. It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4 providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time. For several reasons I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem nothing was connected to COM2. Although the modem appeared to work during every connection at 9600 or 14.4 it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support they suggested disabling the COM2 port. This appeared to solve the disconnect problem but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a Tech Support rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured. Conclusion: I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection. For $30 more I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better..."

I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you want a real answer post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster. personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact this is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now. and now to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions post them to comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm if someone posts complete and utter bs you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds too.  there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis of course is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation LAPM) but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >The difference >with the Courier is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question: >In a previous article cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says: >>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST modem or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST period.  it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST. also not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb. >This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about HST we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme. >The Sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way >only. I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e. part of the standard).  it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual). second HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if you're logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of info back transfer files (not using bimodem) etc....  there is of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again more correctly put *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do) you're S.O.L.....  there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25 the 33 and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance with the cache enabled is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache which is around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2 compatibility but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX PGA and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available from Cyrix there.  Anyway the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16 and 386DX-20 only.  Double these clock rates and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50 then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K external cache performance were about 30% faster than the 25 but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO the DLC is a great low price upgrade for people who can't afford or can't install a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it but if you need 486DX-33 performance the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure about the DLC-40 but I think even if it matches the performance it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC people sent quite a bit of mail asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip e-mail me and I can fax or mail you more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use So I can;t post anymore info here.  However if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God you say...

Date: Wed Apr 21 19:01:49 1993 The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an idle temp - not doing lots of bus i/o not doing floating point not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This is in a Micron computer without heatsink. I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip but I might take the fan off.  It makes a horrible whine at times and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc... -- Rob Scholten scholten@epg.nist.gov End of File Press RETURN to quit Rob Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks of use mine did... As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink instead. Work just like a charm but the realy biggy to think about is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while! Sam -- Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...

I have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system. When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like you have connected to another EC modem doesn't realy say that. But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on on your modem. I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$ in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test bench.

I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill. I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=>17) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been very happy with a 16 on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic. Ok stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?

"1","==== BEGIN REPOST ==== IBM Apple Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week as Motorola Corp. IBM and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks respectively sources said. Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80 respectively. The 601 a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. The chip which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture is bus independent so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures including ISA EISA or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design one source noted. According to sources familiar with the development effort Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100 one source said. ==== END REPOST ===="

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only} some monitors and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous} SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports electronics and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode hence term 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit}. 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2. 8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2."

"1","FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax v.42 v.42bis and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression so you can get error-free links up to 57600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will fall back to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows OS/2 Unix etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom US Robotics etc).  And it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996 or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store. > I was told that it should be possible but that they had no idea how > it might be done.  Nor did they particularly care to investigate. OK here's my results so far.... 1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support Analogue video input (It works but isn't very linear...) 2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter. If you don't know how to do it don't even contemplate it.. :-) 3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode. OK having said that I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder. I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge and doesn't care about the polarity outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires. There are 2 reasons for doing this 1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're in - herc emulation is +- while MVGA is ++ for example. 2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes 3!) monitors sitting on my desk and I want to get that number down as much as possible. Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour I can get down to 1. Ultimately the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else so it'll have to wait... -- Alan Brown dogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz"

The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge have never heard of Unix and have very little interest in learning.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board.

You can get SCSI and IDE to work together but there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542): * You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives. * You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this though) and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to the SCSI BIOS but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

You might find it interesting. -- Darryl Okahata Internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com DISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day. =============================================================================== > 1)  Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE?   Will there be a noticable >     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate? For MSDOS applications ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up in some cases).  You'll also pay much much more for a good SCSI controller. Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix). Unfortunately neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage. However note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices. If you're only going to be using MSDOS stick with IDE.  It's cheaper and you'll have less headaches. > 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my >     hard-drive (bernoulli box CD-rom Tape Drive etc). [ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ] No.  Generally you have to find drivers for each SCSI device which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the better/high performance SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card or can be purchased (for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are: * Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI controllers. * CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)). This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card that has an ASPI driver like the Adaptec. Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately it works only with Adaptec controllers. > 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a >     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar >     equipment. Yes you will run into problems if you're using a high-performance bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound right doesn't it?  It's true though.  With one of these controllers you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250) and Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape backups).  If you want a copy of my Adaptec 1542 hints and tips file send email. These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC (e.g. no standards).  However adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible. SCSI holds a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1 stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say probably because while I know this to be true with a PC Unix I don't know if this really will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will but I don't know for sure.  ]"

The price is about the same but the Gateway has significantly better performance (200MB vs. 120MB hard drive 50Mhz 486DX2 vs.  25Mhz 486SL) and much cheaper accessories (extra batteries modem...) The concern I have about Gateway is the durability and reliability. Does anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad? Thanks Denis Lambert denisl@col.hp.com"

Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster >Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure >you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS obviously. Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens but a slightly simplified explanation. Technically the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer adapter SoundBlaster modem hard disk ...) to signal the CPU that Something's happening here please take note. How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. In MS-DOS the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt. Now basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When DOS prints it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there wait a while and check again.  If there's not copy a new character to the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case the SB. With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely it wastes a lot of CPU cycles.) Hence you can't share the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot. Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. When the SB plays plain music the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is needed. You can however hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt but use them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports and it can see from which port the data came from. This of course applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well. Remember this was greatly simplified in parts but I think gives the general picture correctly enough.

"1","I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday and installed it into my Gateway DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2 but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2 or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this cascade to IRQ8-15 business? A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5 6 7 are 16 bit DMAs and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question after installing PAS16 my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far).

This card is fairly fast will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768 but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS (the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17 Magnavox which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match. But...

Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A) and what I would say is a standard (not special no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? I actually have a PAS-16 and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2? Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions. Randy"

"1","I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK but is unhookable to anything standard (CGAEGAVGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise. I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card."

I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month when it is released though it'll be in limited quantities I think they have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out a bit later). Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal frequency right?) you're gonna love the 2 megs version.

It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and 800x600x16 bit at 90Hz too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate) If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL you should go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW) in the video sig.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now. SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives (ESDIRLLIDEetc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers to get it to work with odd environments.

The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a (stuff deleted) My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip. It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case so the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go. All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable. There are other board type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment. The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison: Wintach Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 Its no Viper but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee oliver@earthview"

"1","I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3 but when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC it shows up as COM3 with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)! When I get into debug and dump the data at 40:0 it shows the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem should be at COM4. Now I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4 2E8 IRQ3. To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC I have to configure the modem as COM3 2E8 IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that allows that the FAX program that came with the modem does not work. Anyway I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set as COM4... I did run a few diagnostic programs and they did not help at all: a few displayed the modem as COM4 and others displayed it as being COM3. I am not using Windows this is just a DOS problem...Any help or pointers appreciated.... For various reasons I must have this modem work at COM4 thus switching COM ports is not an answer... (Last time I posted this I did not get any DOS specific answer this time I have included all the specific information....please help!) ----- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org -- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org avinash@genesis.nred.ma.us"
"1","I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5 drives in particular the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap and have nice 3-5 year warranties. My questions are: Is there a catch? Which one is better? What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use? Is the service generally better for one of these manufacturers? Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason? thanks Michael Taylor"

On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter and it worked fine (rather he sent in the coupon for the converter). In other cases I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever else.

All tests were made on the same >computer with the same disk no cache and the same (big) files were used. Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else.  With Stacker any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. Personally I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff.  Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive. >But DOS 6 is quite good; reformat disks? I honestly don't understand WHY >you had to do this. Ditto. koberg"
"1","greetings.. I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware. My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to configure it as slave drv but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western Dig since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted It just beeped and gave me an error message about HDD controller. So I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD. any help on this matter would be much appreciated. (before I trashed my 42MB) Thankx much Handy Trisakti - uc532838@mizzou1.missouri.edu"
"1","Which would YOU choose and why? Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A) and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? Thanks for any comments. Randy"
"1","Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5 floppies? These drives are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Just a thought. Kin Chan sparrow+@cmu.edu"

"1","Hi peeps Here's another of those any ideas type queries. I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy without a keyboard.  But no problem so far. When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams? Sync? So any ideas.

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better performance though.

To put it a little differently: - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer. - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7 usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - Unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers (i.e. either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers (assert high assert low or don't assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. (Incidentally note that there's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines and that certainly isn't a requirement.) - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2 NT (?) various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons. And the SB16 alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers. Joe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)"

However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark. A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy drive plug the same cables into the floptical stick in a flopti-disk and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy. On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers I have reread a PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was quoted as saying that a 2.5 MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being productized. The article said that one of the problems holding back development in this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead to get MDs accepted. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625 inmos ltd 1000 aztec west almondsbury bristol bs12 4sq They didn't like the rates they don't like the poll tax and they won't like the council tax.   - Nicholas Ridley"

While this is true there are fixes for those who have already bought Diamond cards.  In Linux for example there are utilities that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards but at least this will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X. I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card for specialized free software avoid Diamond.  But if you already have one there may be a fix that can help you.

As far as I know there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory thereby erasing it. This will remove the password but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386 there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is something like this on your board too. In the future I would suggest that YOU set the password and leave it on Setup only. That way no-one else can go and reset it or set it to  Always unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386's for just the same reason. -Dale /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ |      DALE M.

"1","HI that might look like a dull request but I have been following this newgroup for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind. I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow. I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide; - quality of windows drivers; - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff). Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip info but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it  let me know. If this information is of any use here is my system configuration: - Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) - monitor DARIUS 14 non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) (can reach 70kHz horizontally) I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings. Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me Guy Lamouche lamouche@ere.umontreal.ca"

With the directly attached fan units I've seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage not just stop working temporarily. > I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel > to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout though. > My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu and it's located so the front fan which sucks air into the case blows right on the heat sink.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340 you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I haven磘 used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet but it might speed up twice. dieter -- Dieter Fritzsche                                      dieter@dischw.toppoint.de Maehlsweg 32 D-2300 Kiel 17 Germany                         Master of the WOM Tel   .: +49 431 362705 (Voice) FAX\BOX: +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX		 compuserve  100060654"

From what I've seen in coursework most CPUs never actually idle.  They will continue to service interrupts etc. etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

"1","Organization: Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia I have a floppy drive which has developed General failure errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5 drive). I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now. However it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk) the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector. Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it. Thanks!

"1","Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

My guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to send me some literature and will report back to the net after I've studied it.

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

I have two SCSI hard drives each has 512KB of 'cache'. There several reasons for this :- When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted. When the drive receives data to be written the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out. In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache! May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well... > > -- > > TMC > (tmc@spartan.ac.BrockU.ca) > Guy -- -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Guy Dawson - Hoskyns Group Plc. guyd@hoskyns.co.uk  Tel Hoskyns UK     -  71 251 2128 guyd@austin.ibm.com Tel IBM Austin USA - 512 838 3377"

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Simple.  First Andrew is correct although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example.  For some time I was short of free interrupts.  I had a tape controller (not a floppy tape) that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2 where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced it would most likely hang.)  Likewise when the tape backup software runs it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) -- Kenneth R. Ballou				VOICE:		 (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software Inc.

"1","Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5 hard drive model LPS240A and have a concern about its behavior. Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I/O it performs what I call phantom seeks. When the PC is absolutely idle I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card not the drive.] My other hard disk a Seagate ST3283A does not have this kind behavior.

This is a common misconception shared my many manufacturers programmers and users alike.  COM3 for example is simply the third equipped COMM port not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1 etc.  If you're playing by the rules you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of standard (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports. So what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.

If this were so knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants) the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact the reverse was true. What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi. On the other hand we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar namely the Canadians.  In fact an exhaustive seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver British Columbia and Seattle Washington... cities with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control. In Seattle handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted. In Vancouver self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short gun control but not unreasonably so. Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery assault (simple and aggravated) burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report. Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact 7.7 times as often. Over the seven-year study 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle as compared to Vancouver was found to be 1.63. When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver. The authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings. ------- This is I feel a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC Chicago Los Angeles and Houston. Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However during the study interval Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods. As well ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And as was reported Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

"2","---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear sir: By now we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data followed by announcements of momentus scientific findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally while they at least present a few interesting data however meaningless the studies misinterpret statistics and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists. The latest effort -- Handgun Regulations Crime Assaults and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities by J.H. Sloan et al. with the accompanying editorial Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10) however is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings in no particular order. 1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright et al. (Ref. 1) to support the statement that some have argued that restricting access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide. Wright et al. in fact studied and rejected that contention. 2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very similar cities with similar economic circumstances histories demographic characteristics and the like. In fact the cities are very different with very different demographic characteristics which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back- grounds problems circumstances and behaviors of the various ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide. 3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect in 1978. As it happens in the three years prior to that (1975- 1977) Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year one-eighth involving handguns (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM article there were 29 homicides per year one-eigth involving handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen? 4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar control? Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen opposite scientific conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide rate *exceeds* that of such wild west cities in Texas as El Paso Corpus Christi Austen and in Colorado Colorado Springs. (Ref. 3) 5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or handguns are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in Vancouver. They use two surrogate approaches in pretending to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of handguns in Seattle and counts primarily *protective* handgun owners. The second however tells nothing about the number of handguns in Vancouver and counts *non-protective* handguns for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns legally for protection registration figures are meaningless. There are 66000 registered handguns in New York City (New York Daily News Sept. 27 1987). Comparing the two that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100000 population in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver meaning Vancouver has a greater prevalence of weapons than New York City. The second method of measuring gun density is Cook's gun prevalence index a previously validated measure of intercity differences. But the validation was by Cook of his own theory. (Ref. 4) Normally second opinions are sought from a different doctor. More significantly the Cook index is based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide (42% in Seattle 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide divided by two (41% in Seattle 12% in Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail- ability of firearms or of handguns in Seattle and Vancouver. 6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun and that provisions exist in Canadian law for owning and carrying handguns for personal protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually the case. 7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain the differences in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences imposed for gun-related crimes violent crimes without guns or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences the authors of the NEJM tale of two cities fail even to mention most factors related to crime control. 8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost 650000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime -- rape robbery assault -- will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim. It is interesting nonetheless that the authors reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms. 9. The Centers for Disease Control which funded the study editorially praised the paper (Ref. 9) saying it applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms particularly handguns. There is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists or criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle study is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary-looking middle-class white males one aged 25 and the other 40 and without first taking their vital signs administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while giving the 40-year-old a placebo then taking their blood pressure and on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough. It would be nice to think that such a study would neither be funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM. Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC make them willing to present shoddy research as scientific breakthroughs in special articles and editorials relating to firearms we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about the distortions contained in Handgun Regulations Crime Assaults and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities and Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science. Clearly all scientific standards go by the wayside whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America. REFERENCES 1.

Wright (from July 1989 issue of REASON Free Minds & Free Markets) Someone once wrote: Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is suggestive but what they conceal is vital.  The problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a community. The nine medical doctors who published Handgun Regulations Crime Assaults and Homicide essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite many historical social and demographic similarities (2) Vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period 1980-86) was 11.3 per 100000 popuation compared with 6.9 in Vancouver. Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes Why? The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion as claimed in the third step of their reasoning that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and unpersuasive; indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true.  We are therefore being asked at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established. Indeed the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed- weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is Cook's gun prevalence index which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case the index shows only that in homicides and suicides *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove then to prove it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything. Even if we were to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that guns are less common in Vancouver we might still question what causes what. The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa. In fact it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation is not cause. Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are similar in many ways implying that they differ mainly in gun availability gun-law stringency and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that all else is equal among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways but a closer look *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100000 in Seattle 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city. Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority groups it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States incidentally do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.) Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young central-city nonwhite men in the United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian percentage? The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many ways as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent more detailed analysis nearly any of these many ways might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such as those between Seattle and Vancouver all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a complex picture.  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison remarking further that blacks *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.  Given the evidence presented in the article *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility *  since detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver. The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates one would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime. Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account?  In this example the hidden variable is city size: Guns are more common in small towns and rural areas whereas crime is a big-city problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences they coud be very seriously misled.  In the study at hand the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables and their results are impossible to interpret. In the editorial Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science accompanying the study two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out.  Absent such effort the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals-- is cause for further concern. [James D.

"2","The ATF agent interviewed on Street Stories reported that the raid was ill planned and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was coming. WHY? I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests for sufficient fire power. Important dates: Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked. On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban given Clintons stated agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent on Street Stories reported that a supervisor was urging them all to get ready fast as they know we are coming. I believe this attack continued even tho the probablility of failure was high  because it came from the top down.

If there are more guns in circulation if follows that more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they have to do it with a gun knife or bare hands. The gun control lobby doesn't seem to understand this point.  If people are intent on committing a crime they will do it with whatever means are available to them. aaron arc@cco.caltech.edu"

That is a gross distortion: Self-defense does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5% by the way is the most conservative possible figure based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500000 to 600000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.) So more correctly there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25000) cases of civilians acting in self-defence only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly the study can not be close to accurate since it ignored these cases of self-defence. Frank Crary CU Boulder"

Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him. So while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution different criminal techinques of using different weapons etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders. >As for knives see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife >than a gun thanks. Face? Possibly. However facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife. >...Fortunately the best defense against a knife isn't >another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have >much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife >assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants). Actually the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem. You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed armed with a knife gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore using (or threatening to use as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker regardless of how he is armed. Knives however are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a serious threat nearly as often as they do guns. Frank Crary CU Boulder"

I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens armed with fireamrs (pistols for the most part) prevent between 80000 (National Crime Survey) and 1000000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500000 to 600000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5000 lives each year. There are roughly 12000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to be any net benefit you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws by their very nature only effect legal sales such a law would remove all the benefits of armed law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who by and large get their guns illegally.) That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me. >...There were over 250 >accidental< handgun >homicides in America in 1990 most with licensed weapons. Since most were with licensed weapons I assume you are not supporting reasonable laws (i.e. waiting periods background checks licenses etc...).

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say as a hobby) he's going to have to pay someone anyway.

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban can not be easily side-stepped. > >To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an > >analogy from computer science... almost every computer science major > >can write a wordprocessor yet we(comp sci majors)  would willingly pay 3 > >to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect... why don't we > >just all write our own software???......

"2","I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy wonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  the Gun War on the Constitution.  Look at what the Bush administration did to get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of crack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been dealt onb the White House Lawn. And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any moral qualms about the raid... The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_ successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will filter this so that the general public will think the BD's are bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed moral qualms are not important to the issue.  They are heroes in the fight against oppressive government;  it could just as well have been you. -watkins@earth.eecs.uic.edu  (Brian E Watkins)"

I think your question should be ...losing sleep over a million expert riflemen? Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland but a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a real pain. The question a conqueror would ask is is it worth the trouble? The more difficult an invasion is the more likely the answer would be no. Certainly a million riflemen (as opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand the best a country the size of Switzerland could support) makes invasions more difficult. >Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this >world.

So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics aside could you make one if you had the funds and time?  The answer is yes.  So do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here? >Of course the hardest part is getting the fissionable material >to start with and living long enough to put a bomb together. >(Plutonium has some *nasty* properties . . .) Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have been lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs than trying to use plutonium.

What do you think 75% of you is? But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would also hit bones and the resulting harmfull secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard. As for a shielded warhead I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry temperature-regulated facility etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep maintain and store a nuclear weapon then some regulation is clearly appropriate. >>  Plus these things have no self- >>defense purposes.

I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American revolution as an example the militias won by seperating themselves from and becoming independent of a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it and those communities (Canada and England for example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive to go out and destroy repressive governments nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that. There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly not all members would supply (for example) a tank only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias as the framers envisioned them were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause only 50% would respond to a muster and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were therefore linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority not of the general public. Worse that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least they would be much richer.) As a result I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

Having lived played and worked on and near the Navajo reservation for a number of years I can confirm this is an ancient pattern found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old. Also the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika. Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and counter-clockwise swastikas. Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. They remember being relocated by the US Army and don't intend to do it again.  The Hopi on the other hand have a dislike for weapons from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better from strangers. -- Kirk Hays - NRA Life seventh generation.

"2","Well I dropped by the library yesterday and picked up back copies of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what it said about self-defense with a firearm. I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988 1989 and 1990 refer only to weapon. The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987 w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem and as such going ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time. Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference and not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have changed significantly between 1986 and 1987. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont.

I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987) their line made so much sense -- only people who need guns should be able to get them and the people who need them are the police and other elites.  Unfortunately for us this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other legitimate uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they can't protect you). >	We all know that the end result regardless of the intention >will be to have a MUCH easier to subdue population for the UN/NWO. >This is definitely a motivation of many in power but I wonder to >what degree this is planned vs just duped.

I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective against the emotional pro-control people.

"2","Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  Adrian -- name changed to protect the guilty -- and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.] Dear Adrian: I'm way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future.  When I do I'll make sure you get copies. There are many arguments I might make from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 10 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs but I'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note. First the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. Second publication of some latter-day scientific study doesn't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying. Third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. Fourth as often happens with these things the study doesn't support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions anyway but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies omissions and distortions. Fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. Sixth the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions (Carl Bakal author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this present study dubious to say the least. Seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. Eighth given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction) you should be better aware than most people how progress -- in designing studies to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create studies proving that pornography causes crime. More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary. Ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. Tenth another reason to doubt all such studies is that human behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization. Eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. Twelfth the study is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefits.  If anything perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense. Thirteenth and finally the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article whatever their shortcomings (and they are many) are correct in this instance:  the study is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. And because of that Adrian even if the study were valid it wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun while they still can. Before the '68 Gun Control Act most of the shooting fraternity viewed handguns (incorrectly as it turned out) as inaccurate ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in the whole country.  Now thanks to Kennedy Metzenbaum the Bradys and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year. The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control et al. are perfectly aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are. Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self-loading pistol is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further).  Even if it were difficult there are already a quarter billion firearms in America with an estimated half life of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna be around a long time Adrian whether you like it or not. As for me to paraphrase Elmer Keith regardless of what the law provides or any court decides I'm always going to be armed.  And I will always work to see that others are as well.  The bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently. So what's the point? L.

The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military in communications intelligence gathering and firepower. In a similar vein the amount of marijuana smuggled into this country has greatly decreased. This is because its value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or heroin. It's simply not worth the risk it's uneconomical. Now most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer is now very strong so a small volume goes a long way. You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a good dollar/pound deal. Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area. It would not be economic to smuggle them in. All production would have to be local. There are not all that many people who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such but the average person and average thug would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would pay through the nose for it."
"2","I wrote : Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were tanks used in sixties riots; instead it is about whether those tanks fired their main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is ludicrous. Awesley replied: I repeated what I had been told under what context I had heard it supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67. The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were quite effective at this.  You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing. Awesley went on: I spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway it took about 10 minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit A Rebellion and It's Victims_ by Sauter and Hines on page 133 telling of the death of Tonia Blanding age 4. When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front of the buildings the tank guns spit again tearing apart huge holes out of the side of the apartment. Well it's not the main gun. Well it's not the main gun.  Gee that's only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong? I wrote: will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American cities in the Sixties. Awesley replied: Well if you bothered to read them it wouldn't take long at all to find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main guns. I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news. Awesley goes on: You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags wouldn't you since it makes your other claim seem more plausible. And on: I don't expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know what you find. I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in? If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. If your mind is open enough to believe that well good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.   And here in reality I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells much less fired them. --John L. Scott"

The University cops here (who are >are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most >state cops are. Define armed better. Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful). A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber. - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users. - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it's jammed! before starting to do anything about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged. I do not consider this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training. Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR. Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say semi-autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot. Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5. What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum but anyway..... ObPlea: Don't flame me I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. -- If everything had gone as planned everything would have been perfect. -BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93 regarding failed raid attempt in TX."

Your assumption is that this low dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?

Wow you gotta love the speculation. As I posted before we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out. I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through. It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs but also a safer thing to smuggle. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits? There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting. >So now why should we allow hunting ... to prevent over-population of >the deer/bear/<whatever> ?

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius you know but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me gun vs. gun with only a month of training.

In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious though were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime or were they aquired by other means?

Yes.  We're too damned violent partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as Americans first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is sadly changing of late but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke low Dane whereas others spoke high Dane.  It was shortly after World War II as I remember that low Dane was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem because we have even more obvious means of identifying an outsider. >			The bad english is not my fault it's probably >			the keyboard-software or the quality of the >			subtext on tv......

I never said that these alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware. Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every person is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect and the relative effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested the good neighbors step up and say THAT'S the one officer ! He was robbing Mr. Jones' house. In short the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.

You don't know much about modern automatic weapons do you?  Just about ANYBODY with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building submachineguns in the school shop. I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of Smallarms of the World.  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions. -- =================================================================== You're like a bunch of over-educated New York jewish ACLU lawyers fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in Arkansas - Holly Silva"

Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland]. Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point i consider deadly [lethal] force to be a proper reaction [and so does the law]. Furthermore use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped and the assailent since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly. -- Michael Phelps (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

"2","Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store a very well stocked firearms store I discovered a printed document that was being distributed by the good folks who work there.  Traders BTW is located in San Leandro CA. Granted the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders but in the big scope of things I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping to this cause. Anyway here it is: NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP Are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life what's good for you what's not and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their advertisments? The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that Traders San Leandro has run for many years. These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so under the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms. If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor yet refuse to run legitimate gun ads please send a letter to the editors indicating your displeasure over their censorship doctrine. Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.  Perhaps you'd like to send them your thoughts on this issue! Oakland Tribune		Daily Review		Alameda Times-Star POB 28883		POB 5050		1516 Oak St. Oakland CA 94604	Hayward94540	Alameda CA 94501 Argus			Tri Valley Herald	San Leandro Times 3850 Decoto Rd.

I can not validate these facts and there were no sources but many feel and sound very true.  Here are the topic headlines: - Big Media Snow Job - Blaming Firearms for Murder is Like Blaming Hospitals for Death - I could use the same Nazi Journalistic Technique of CBS and ABC to prove that Hospitals Cause Death - How NBC CBS and ABC have scammed the American people on gun control - American TV journalism is based on Nazi journalism - Why TV journalists lie - The Government with the help of the TV networks has succeeded in playing one group against the other - Gun laws are unconstitutional - American gun laws are based on Nazi gun laws - The Government is trying to devide and conquer - The CIA wants your firearms and so on for six pages. So now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying to limit their exposure to potential customers and preventing the customers from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting hunting or other recreational use.

They were actually practicing |taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target |and they weren't doing too badly either.   The University cops here (who are |are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most |state cops are.  I don't know where you are originally from David but you live |in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news |and in the papers.  I think the situation is just a tad different here |than there. However don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the Glock which is not approved for carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...). Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king some of the more elite police types want revolvers. I don't think the issue is cost because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year. Your presumption of disadvantage I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers. I've seen S&Ws Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers carried by Chicago cops.... in the past I've seen .45 M1911s; others have seen Browning Hi-Powers... |Jason"

I seem to recall incidents in the past where Chinese entreprenaurs attempted to smuggle AK-47s (semi-autos) into this country to get around import number limitations (May have been Gunweek where I read that years ago...) Any person with high-school drafting skills and vocational school machineshop training could produce a submachinegun. You talk about the average person not being able get even a zip-gun; well now think of all that private CNC controlled machinery that is not being used for 3 shifts a day; do you think that if guns were being sold on the black market for say $150 an enterprising mechanical engineer could be using that machinery to produce workable submachineguns for sale? After all GUNWEEK had an article and pictures on how BATF was looking for the manufacturer of quite efficient silencers that were of commercial quality and finish. Look at it this way 25% of the U.S. households have a handgun. Say at least half of those keep one for self-defense. You are talking a potential market of of tens of millions of people who would seek firearms for the purpose of self-preservation. Only a fool would believe that market would not be filled regardless of government prohibitions."

You still haven't offered I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff I'd rather face a knife than a gun has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing then I got 'educated.' People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death. The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter. Most people have never seen knife wounds aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut hopefully not as bad as the attacker. Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison. If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat or in the case of an experienced attacker parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE not the pointed end.) Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that destroys the skeletal structure it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.' This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A. the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots fired after SHE had been shot struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle went through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh. The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this. Remember folks the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive. I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker and if I could pick and choose I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes. Rick."

Boundaries or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word unconditional implies no agreements or all previous agreements are off which is the opposite. The words used in the first amendment are much stronger i.e. congress shall make no law are much stronger.  They clearly ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply unconditional.  If the writers of the amendment wanted unconditional whay didn't they says congress shall make no laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms? The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws at any time.  To guarantee this right the laws cannot stopped the people from forming a well regutaled militia.  The duties of a well regulated militia to the government are descussed in Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8 Article II Section 2 and the Second Amendment of the constitution. -- +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ |                             |  If only it were a modern document with a   | | John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    | | Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

"2",">Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing >that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is >that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety. You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe. Now in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot. The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it. The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.

Agreed. Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue. I've had bullets come out of the case keeping the cylinder from turning see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds. Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction but as a rule when it does you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category. Vincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense. In general I'd agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm. Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother. For myself I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says buy em all! That said I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!) If this post had gone the other way I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-) Rick."

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority.... You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke. 'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1000000 Americans using firearms each year over a 30 year period we get (roughly since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now but many of these are minors and should be included etc thus the percentage if anything is low.) At any rate most minority groups in this range are not usually referred to as 'tiny' minorities so I don't see how the other part of the group can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use own or display a firearm. Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms. >	                               Besides there are other >	means of self-protection which can be just as effective >	as firearms.

Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years. The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that the history of the entire world contained smuggling and that whenever something was wanted it was smuggled in. If the problem were based on U.S. guns it would have surfaced years before. Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided. Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited in the U.S. >Hell here in Britain the cops don't even carry guns.

The two are not the same as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership*. The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled never funded or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York Chicago and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun owners would in theory support these planes.  (Although the numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem that intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of the next person who comes down the pike with a reasonable suggestion they've already seen abused. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

"2","There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16. Pick it up hold it about a foot from your face and look closely at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions its an AR-15 if it has three its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences as well but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see them they are not valid in this discussion.  So in conclusion there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15 from an M-16 except at close (very close) range. David Bixler Auburn University All standard disclaimers apply."

Their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the European monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite language though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty and then convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain.. But first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to restrict us to squirrel guns and such so we'd be properly submissive while they forced us to pay for their wars.

There are but not any that would help Texans: In many states such laws have been found to violate the state constitution. But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the states. It was written to limit the federal government only. The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However the exact wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it directly for over 100 years. In practice the Bill of Right (indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on the Second Amendment. Frank Crary CU Boulder"

In which case the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this. >Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: >What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS! How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting target shooting and self-defence. Like cars murder isn't their only (or even a common) use. >If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them >or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem >it's the 'axer' ?? I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong. >Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect >themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ?? A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point what can these individuals do about long-term social problems? >If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have >guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA) There are according to surveys guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are on average safer than those where guns are less common. >LAST WORD: >Responsible gun owners are not a problem but they will be affected if >you want to protect your citicens. This is I think a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish or restrict the average law-abiding citizen in the name of some vague common good. Frank Crary CU Boulder"

Mr. Parsli I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove. >OR you should >get a new goverment. (You do have elections??) I'd love to.

It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed to do it then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism. >Guns 'n Criminals: >MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen. This is very likely. >Known criminals can NOT buy weapons that's one of the points of gun control. >And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe) >we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns. The North American Continent is not Europe no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S. yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument. >Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: >What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS! No there are approximately 31000 deaths due to guns in the U.S. two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate. >The issue (I hope..): >I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. >Guns are not a problem but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??) > >I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia: >They should all have weapons it's their rigth to have them and if they use them >to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans not guns. The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent. Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons. Anyway the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns even if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality. >If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them >or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem >it's the 'axer' ?? >(An example don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...) In the U.S. approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists. In any case I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is violent crime you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse. >Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect >themselves. Is this a good situation ?? The situation is not good in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods? >Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ?? The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles no it isn't. However if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it. You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.) >If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have >guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA) 45% of Households have some form of firearm usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated well-off whites the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime. You may take that for what it's worth. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

Should you stay and wait for the cops or should you >collect your brass (if you're using a semi-auto) and get out of there >(provided of course you don't think that you have been seen)? For me it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been publicly carrying the weapon concealed something I'm not in the habit of doing... Even then the worst I'd have to deal with was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so clear and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide it would still be safer to wait for the police. If I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement I'd be committing several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence in court (If it really was self-defence the prosecuter would ask why did you run away and hide from the police?) In other states however this decision might not be so clear-cut: If someone in say Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible conviction for half a dozen. Frank Crary CU Boulder"

Tanks deployed against civilians let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country.  Against civilians that have at most one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And snipers too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire. I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even violent) of the citizens that suggests that the government is totally out of control since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility government of the people BY THE PEOPLE not the 'lords' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going the citizens wouldn't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored.  And yes there is a criminal element that will exploit this but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks heavy machine guns or whatever. Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them in the dark Smother them with shit and Crush them when ready... And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)... Unbelievable. And I do believe amid the smoke confusion etc of a real riot situation that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many explosions.  It is loud but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall and some rubble but with tanks knocking over walls and other sources of buildings turning into rubble and other covering racket such as gunfire including 50's tacking away it would not stand out that much and could be explained by musta been a gas leak... .  I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon turning and firing you know.  THAT would stand out and be pretty impossible to cover up. >--John L.

"2","Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station KTVB Channel 7. Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4. Friday April 16 1993 was the fourth day of the trial. Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied. The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first. Cooper acknowledged that he carried a 9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel. [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog. When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down. Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events Cooper responded If you're implying that we got our story together you're wrong counselor.  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1 so start acting like professionals. Spence told the judge that When all the evidence is in we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events. Spence continued We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses. Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders. Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was preposterous and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting. The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility. Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that but he could not remember when.  He then stated that I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted. Monday April 19 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled is the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton."

After a large response (about 15 email messages) I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting. *** file follows *** Hi Folks; As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial. Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today. More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?  On the evening news she said I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.  Nice sound bite (grin)! The news reporter also interviewed some guy named Tim who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. Tim had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?). Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother. Anyhow Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case any.  He said he was confident that once the evidence came out that Weaver would be aquitted. More stuff as it comes available. Drew"
"2","Hi. I've just finished reading S414 and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025). 1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill? What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're in committee. How close is that to being made law? 2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important differences I missed? 3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes: A. S414 doesn't specify an appeals process to wrongful denial during the waiting period other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established but not before). B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving using existing records (so who would I sue in A above to have an inaccurate record corrected?) C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an immediate threat to his or her life or life of a household member. But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a threat nor does it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes? 4. With just S414 what's to stop a person with a clean record from buying guns grinding off the serial numbers and selling them to crooks? At minimum what additional laws are needed to prevent this? 'Seems at min. a gun counting scheme would be needed (e.g. John Doe owns N guns).  So if S414 passes I wouldn't be surprised to see legislation for stricter harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun registration justified by a need to make the Brady bill work. Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.

You know in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten things out in this country.  Also people would have a need to replace guns with something else perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC seem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal. Guns are really old in design and as long as we have tons of them no one is motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with some real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get us moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want right?  Stuff that's smaller lighter and far more deadly. Remember in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossible feats if we are motivated enough and I think self-defense is high on our list of motivators."

And horror of horrors!  You don't even NEED a permit to carry a concealed weapon while outside of city limits (although you do need a permit for concealed carry in an automobile).

"2","[MODERATOR:  Nice summary Keith thanks.] I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email followup to t.p.g. 1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to protect life also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns must be stored locked up and unloaded however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines it is still not clear who will be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province. The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines. Apparently the authorization is to specify how many of these 'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess them but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines. (God knows how much they'll charge for these) This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory do not take it as gospel.

This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more priviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding citizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the leaders of the system? Could it be that the criminal is one of the tools the authorities are using to excuse some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon the law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crime problem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to our help.

We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use in violent crime ... ~1%) but if public opinion were so dead-set against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary to what you might think time is probably on OUR side not YOURS. >This is the end. By the finish of the Clinton administration your >RKBA will be null and void. Tough titty. Yeah right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands but this has nothing to do with the issue at hand. ... ridiculous tripe deleted ... >The press is against you the public (the voting public) is against >you the flow of history is against you ... this is it ! Yeah the liberal press doesn't like us much but you can't really expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which are generously provided by the FBI if they'd bother to put on their Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends are anti-gun and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized when all it really does is make us all sheep. They would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob rape and murder. They support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYCDC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VTNHID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no we certainly can't accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly hurting them and their families they will probably whistle a different tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then. >Surrender your arms. Soon enough officers will be around to collect >them. Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time. Hmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight. I might be able to whip up a quick cheese and cracker plate but they should probably bring their own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug? >Too fucking bad.

Alas this is not provable. I think that that > there are actually *few* cases where this is so. excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago: Although less apparent to those who have not researched the facts personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as sport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by criminals to commit it (645000 vs. 580000 respectively  in this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed. and  57% agreed that most criminals are more worried  about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.2 One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for that  area  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32000 attempted rapes showed  that overall when rape is attempted the completion rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun the completion rate drops to 3%. 1 G Kleck Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter NY 1991 2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms Aldine de Gruyter NY 1986 ------- __________________________________________________________________________ [unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

"2","The debate over the Second Amendment rages on. Arguments continue over what a well-regulated militia is and what TRKBA means in practical terms.  However the ONLY authority in this area is a binding court decision on the matter.  Even a decision in this area is subject to an overturning by a higher court.  Is there anyone who has the facts of a legal precedent preferably a Supreme Court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment?"

If you are going to make use of this dubious analogy at least make it accurate.  And by the way in Texas you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials) but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life. So I won't even consider registration *manadatory* safety classes or *manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing all local state and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second Amendment and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit good anywhere in the United States.

Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled the hammer can't hit the firing pin. > The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of > deaths caused by animal attacks or wacko attacks combined. The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims a large negative number of people are killed by animals because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero. >I can find the figures if you don't believe me.

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston chances are almost certain that she won't be counted as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.

Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The average threat level in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.

Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang member.  Sure enough a few nights later there was a drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time unlike in LA the entire street came out and returned fire putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.

In the mid-80's they ran a One Million Strong! campaign for two years before reaching this goal. My understanding is that they reached it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a Two Million Strong! campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership. In 1964 just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement the NRA had a mere 625000 members. By 1968 barely after the first murmurs of future registration it had about a million.  Today it has over three million members making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's Gun Control pp. 61 and 420.) As you say many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against hard-core gun banners. I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.

Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's). With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g and close to the realm of r.g but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different and that different is good.  The main advantage is not in increased firepower but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun. |> |> Define armed better.

Yes but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot. |> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again |>   to rotate to the next round. I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time. |> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the |>   hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an |>   easy motion even one handed. Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.

Can be faster depending on users. The best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later). |> |> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell |>   first time spent which can be fatal.

Yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs Glocks et.al.). |> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round |>   and cock the hammer.

All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course) and shooting it a lot I see no inherent safety problems with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver. |> |> Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly |> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there. |> |> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun |> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.

You have encurred the wrath of Glock owners.  We will beat you with our hammers.  Oooops don't have any  :-) Seriously.  There is no difference in the safeties betweena Glock and any DA revolver.

I'm currently looking at a copy of last Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says WANTED: We pay cash for assault rifles and pistols.. Granted I haven't seen today's paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it. It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.

As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works the local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they weren't interested in student discipline records only for stats so people could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was. It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats to be released because they complained certain segments of the campus population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

(I don't know. Haven't used one in 20 years) Money orders operate pretty much like checks with both parties being supposed to sign them.  I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people an ID and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID. As far as traceable as a practical matter I don't know it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  I'd say certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who they gave money orders out to. >Is that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?

How much is through the nose?  After all we know quite a bit about how much a gun is worth to a criminal so if that is dwarfed by the price demanded by the bad part of that 90%.... The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The profit of gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated. That analysis ignored some improvements in the criminal gun market that could make them even cheaper.

R. 1276 To establish the right to obtain firearms for security and to use firearms in defense of self family or home and to provide for the enforcement of such right. ======================= IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 10 1993 Mr. BARTLETT introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary ======================= A BILL To establish the right to obtain firearms for security and to use firearms in defense of self family or home and to provide for the enforcement of such right. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa- tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 1993. SEC. 2. RIGHT TO OBTAIN FIREARMS FOR SECURITY AND TO USE FIREARMS IN DEFENSE OF SELF FAMILY OR HOME; ENFORCEMENT. (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHT. -- A person not pro- hibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm shall have the right to obtain firearms for security and to use fire- arms in defense of self family or home. (b) FIREARM DEFINED. -- As used in subsection (a) the term firearm means a -- (1) shotgun (as defined in section 921(a)(5) of title 18 United States Code); (2) rifle (as defined in section 921(a)(7) of such title); or (3) handgun (as defined in section 10 of Public law 99-408). (c) ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHT. -- (1) IN GENERAL. -- A person whose right under subsection (a) is violated in any manner may bring an action in any United States district court against the United States any State or any person for damages injunctive relief and such other relief as the court deems appropriate. (2) AUTHORITY TO AWARD A REASONABLE AT- TORNEY'S FEE. -- In an action brought under para- graph (1) the court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party other than a State a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs. (d) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. -- An action may not be brought under subsection (c)(1) after the 5-year period that begins with the date the violation described therein is discovered. ------------------------ (end of HR 1276) ------------------------ Well this sounds good to me.  The key is Section (2)(c)(2) which will effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folks who can't afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall. All of you who've been saying hey isn't that illegal? could just go hire your own Attorneys on a pay-if-you-win (contingency fee) basis and sue the bums ...   :-) What you can do now: (1)  Write your Representative and ask them to co-sponsor HR 1276. (2)  Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett the sponsor -- Representative Roscoe Bartlett 312 Cannon House Office Building Washington D.C. 20515 -- to tell him who your own Representative is and that you've asked them to join him as a co-sponsor of HR 1276. (3)  Contact Gun Owners of America -- Gun Owners of America 8001 Forbes Place Springfield Virginia 22151 -- which has committed to lobby on behalf of HR 1276. (4)  For those of us with a RealJob (TM) find out how to reach Representative Bartlett's campaign fund (I'm working on it) and toss in a few bucks.  You can bet your bippy that he's going to be one of the HCI targets in the next election which isn't that far away (1994). (5)  Tell your family friends gun club etc.  Enjoy ...   :-)"

So you have the right unless the Federal Government says you don't. I don't think I like this very much. This would be much better if it said everyone except those who have been striped of this right by due process of law or some such thing. Also I don't care for the Federal Government stepping on states rights regardless of which state right is being stepped on.  If the constitution doesn't give the Feds some power then they have to just shut up about it. The only way the Feds should have anything to say is if the Constitution prohibits localities from infringing on the RKBA.  In which case this bill should just reiterate that the RKBA is guaranteed by the Constitution and that the Feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed. -- -- chris bartz (chrisb@natinst.com)"

"2","You know I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not make sence and I was wondering if someone could help me out. Say U.S.C. 922 : (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun. Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a person might also be an artificial entity that is created by government and has no rights under the federal constitution. So what I don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional until it goes to court. So has it ever gone to court not just your run of the mill Ok I had it I am guilty put me in jail Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told by the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right? -- Brian Sheets		    _   /|  	TRUCK?!

"2","OK here's something for all of those people who think cops are always more responsible then the rest of the population.  I found this article in the Rocky Mountain Collegian Colorado State University's newspaper. SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDE PROVIDENCE R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked said You're going to die and fatally shot him and two others police said. A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car. The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday. Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta 23 of Cranston was arrested at gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in Foster a rural town of about 4000 people in northwest Rhode Island. Well this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping just like everyone else.  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns? Doug Holland"

What exactly did I claim? -------------------------------------------------- I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively. -------------------------------------------------- I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the to use your words bullshit filters.  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood. What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post: -------------------------------------------------- >We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song Black Day in July. -------------------------------------------------- Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does that means I was right. : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news. So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48. Awesley goes on: You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags wouldn't you since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible. John again strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here you're boring here. : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it. Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was several.  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth. : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. Taking the tour after the riots it was pretty easy to tell the difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up. Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two. : If your mind is open enough to believe that well good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells much less fired them.

There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger hence less training time required. Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer dropas well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various gun magazines.  If fact one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey. You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation opening the issuing citycounty etc.. to lawsuits bad press etc.. Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late. Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact it was my first handgun.  Remember the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling. As per the part of being light weight and looking cool I agree 100%.

The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor. Is self-defense considered appropriate and if so under what conditions?  (Are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.) >The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or >records of SERIOUS mental diseases. This has been suggested in the U.S. and generally supported among gun owners.

At this point it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one or to operate it on private property.  That is the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile for instance which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get past legally since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property but in restricting activity on private property. >Use of guns in crimes (in Norway): >Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' >for a long time but these are rather the exeption. >Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short >time befor the crime. > >Use of knives: >It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or 'open'. >You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun but not to carry it open >in public -rigth ?? This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another). Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton. >Individual vs masses: >Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some >extent.... >Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? >What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of >all the others ?? The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group here defined as people who own guns) are adversely affecting the rights of some other group. If for instance Bob were using his gun to attack Steve you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own guns then some third person perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one. >The issue: >I believe the issue is GUNS and gun-legislation. The issue is crime violence and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those. >We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one.... >IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME. >But should it have to be like that ?? Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will. >Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ?? No state does.  In any case there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's wisdom on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless concept. >If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think >it should be free to buy guns ?? I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

Policy 18 for example opposes rating systems for motion pictures: Industry sponsored ratings systems create the potential for constraining the creative process and thus contracting the marketplace of ideas. Despite the stated goal of providing guidance to parents experience has shown that ratings inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of expression. In regards to the Pledge of Allegiance the ACLU states in its Policy 84: The insertion of the words `under God' into the Pledge of Allegiance is a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of Church and State. Policy 120 states that Military conscription under any circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and constitutional guarantees. The ACLU objects to the draft even during wartime because of the anti-democratic power it gives government to wage war without support of the people. Policy 125 states The ACLU calls for a broad-based inquiry into war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace focusing upon the actions of the United States military and other combatants against the people of South Vietnam Laos Cambodia and North Vietnam. Policy 133 states The ACLU recognizes that US government reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign and domestic policy while propounded as a defense of democracy is in fact a great threat to civil liberties. Four decades of adherence to this policy has fundamentally altered the nature of our constitutional democratic process and poses a paramount threat to our civil liberties. Policy 217 objects to roadblocks where drivers are stopped for sobriety tests because they violate Fourth Amendment principles. Policy 242 states the following on criminal sentencing: The most appropriate correctional approach is reintegrating the offender into the community and the goals of reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the offender within the community than by incarceration. Probation should be authorized by the legislature in every case; exceptions to the principle are not favored and any exceptions if made should be limited to the most serious of offenses such as murder or treason.

"2","UPI Washington DC Update Desk			4/15/93 For the past several months the Clinton administration has been stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the economy there has been no corresponding improvement in the area of jobs creation. The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month in an effort to understand this problem President Clinton appointed a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore. Today the panel released their results providing a shocking conclusion. It's the guns Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members and other gun-nuts are purchasing firearms at in record numbers pulling the economy out of the recession.  Their buying them five times faster than ever before and stockpiling left and right the Vice President said. However since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have been experiencing hard times during the past few years including several declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers they have not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand. We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people said the President of Colt industries.  As long as Clinton is in office we suspect it will he added. In response to this new information President Clinton announced a new Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's called the Ban-One-A-Month Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any further manufacture/importation or sale in this country except to the politically connected and to members of the National Police Force. The President said This law will benefit America two ways.  When the Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days the gun-nuts will run out and buy thousands of them boosting the economy even more.  In addition over the long run we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the street.  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee this program citing her Honesty and unbiased view on the subject of gun control. Senators Metzenbaum DeConcini Feinstein and Boxer have proposed an amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  Their stockpiling stockpiling stockpiling screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc. Senators Simon Metzenbaum and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying First we'll fuck em then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning during a press conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow the people to purchase the guns to help the economy but would require the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008 after all of the cards have been drawn. The head of the BATF responded by saying We will have to see if this thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those guns. US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado declared this proposed law as being reasonable gun control which won't affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns. - end article - For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) Bill Vojak vojak@icebucket.stortek.com NRA ILA Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

So like what do you do during those six months to be active? My town has a similar requirement and it's rather stupid.  Before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well how active can you be without a gun chief? Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this. > It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ??? > You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to... Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners I'd think twice before using this analogy. Besides the problem is criminal use of guns not accidents.  (There are about 500000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one. Just like the check most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses another doesn't fund them a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections.

Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both but require licenses for concealed carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern. > Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive': > We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners but when we decide > to take action we DO.

Typically the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just pre-felons waiting to commit crimes. > We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....

"2","[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.] Gun Owners Action League our state rifle association started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost and filled out the area something proud. Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of election fraud to hold their jobs. Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases who they were). Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident. The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30 but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room. One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said Oh it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.  I got a little pissed and replied I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district. At 12:30 your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there in his mirror reflective shades talking to one of the anti-gun types and several Simon's Rock anti-gun close-the-loophole protestors. (Earlier Randy had covered the GOAL rally.) The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember there were about 160 gun owners there plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else. Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to support GOAL's position on all bills. First because of their time constraints public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew I guess). Currently Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously the law was similar but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a loophole and wanted it closed. Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his SKS assault rifle. The second one Hodgekiss a co-sponsor had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr from Gloucester claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state as strong as that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do that's that. Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  In some of these other states anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing! (Oooooo!)  We have some very very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.  (Naughty naughty!) Next up was Boston city councilman Albert Dapper O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU said violent criminals should be executed and that if he were judge he'd give arrestees their last rights (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-( Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID and confiscate all your guns if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant no hearing no evidence and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook. Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. Revenue has nothing to do with it.  (Yeah right.)  Apparently some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook. The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both restraining order bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He was a co-sponsor of one of the restraining order bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place but his arguments seemed to be confined to every year it's the same damn thing you come in here with this crap... It's nice to have a friend on the committee but he could have been more effective. At about 3:00 it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus and so missed the public testimony; the other got a seat this time. Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago left the state and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: If you purchase a gun today it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.) Testimony was heard from several battered women one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill saying how 50000 restraining orders were granted last year and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response. Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman) and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony. Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that this is America and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this saying that people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.  (Point and match Senator.) Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship expired every 5 years and that a driver's license was a privilege not a right like the right to keep and bear arms. A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed and joking responded that he too favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope and I'll tie the noose. Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo and that he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside without his evil gun.  She said that the loophole should be closed to prevent something like this from ever happening again. Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on saying As long as one person can buy a gun in anger none of us are safe -- support gun control.  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids except for Caron who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  Only residents can get FID's he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?) Yacino and McNutt spoke again this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT NH and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and hell even an CCW as he had NO criminal or mental record. One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters and thought it was elitist.  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had FID-type cards so complying with all the laws of one's home state was not enough.  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming Everyone's out of step but Johnny! All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were: o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported) o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed) o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly opposed) o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws (opposed) o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported) o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported) o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed) o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported) o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!) Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them. Mike Yacino noted that besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked. Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said This would create hundreds of different licensing systems. The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet..."

This at least has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future national system. To get emergency medical care anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital you must notify Blue Cross or they will refuse to pay your bills. In an emergency where you must be treated before notifying them you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.) Therefore you are required to carry the card at all times or do without emergency medical coverage. Frank Crary CU Boulder"

"2","I don't know what Traders is claiming but it appears to me that the Oakland Tribune has censored gun ads in the past.  Likewise for the San Francisco Chronicle and I have never seen a gun ad in the San Francisco Examiner. Specifically about a year ago on Thursdays when Traders placed its ads the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representing any handgun sale though text could list it.  The Trib. would run a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Traders ad at all. Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noise about measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Traders ad then started publishing it but without any handgun graphic then stopped then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago it has not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludes a Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take their ads.

"2",">> Do you know how many deaths each year are caused by self-inflicted gun- >> shot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters? There are roughly 1200 fatal firearms-related accidents each year. The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered so the number of self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters is probably well under 250 per year. >>If you fall for example >> and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow the gun will discharge. Handguns designs have included a hammer block since around 1960 or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact the gun cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or in some cases if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) >> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of >> deaths caused by animal attacks or wacko attacks combined. I don't know about animal attacks but there are 23500 murders each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only 2.1% of the murders were killings by wackos you would be wrong. Worse there are also 102500 rapes and 1055000 aggravated assaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks and preventing them thousands of times more significant than the accidents you are worried about. (These figures by the way are from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 1990. I'll stop by a library tomorrow and look at the National Crime Victimization Survey which is more specific about where and when the crimes occured.) Frank Crary CU Boulder"
"2","Dennis Deconcini 1982 ...In these and similar areas the Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense but of 5 U.S.C. Sec 552 which was intended to prevent secret lawmaking by administrative bodies. These practices amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States. It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens. It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property. It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law. The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators particularly felons ille- gally in possession and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee however expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations. ( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S REPORT of the SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION of the COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION FEBRUARY 1982 Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 88-618 O WASHINGTON : 1982 Letter to Constituent: April 1993 Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) which is the Federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations. It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government. The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence also both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons. The Waco Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics semi-automatics and machine-guns in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning knowing from their source inside that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored. As you may be aware by now Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians. Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am however deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion.

James Madison Federalist Paper 46: Besides the advantage of being armed which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ James Madison I Annals of Congress 434 8 June 1789: The right of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A well regulated militia composed of the body of the people ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country...

Oh I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist Papers?! James Madison Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the General Welfare clause): Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He only wrote it. > The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with > the security of a free state.

I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance or level of threat we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others so we do a 5' restriction or the possibility of being shot hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it. >They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to >protect their homes and families. Using nuclear weapons close >to home will not accomplish this. I disagree on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally my home is worth say twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk. >There is however another problem: In any case of civil war >the strength of the militias fighting on each side should >reflect the popular will.

That seems to be the case already given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers obviously due to cost I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness. >I think it is vital to avoid such a situation where a small >minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power >through violence.

I had envisioned that the armorer perhaps the officers of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex weapons.  But if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large though chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated. >Here I think we have to be carefull about _which_ state we >are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to >overthrow a repressive government and it would be completely >destructive to that end for that same government to control >the militia's arms.

The risk of abuse while >still something to consider is far less than the similar risk >were the federal government in control. This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers. >That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select >militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained >specialists. For the reasons I have outlines above I think >these heavy weapons (tanks artillery aircraft etc...) are >better off being kept by local governments than by a small >number of individuals.

Similarly the >select militia should be incapable of action without the >aid of the general militia. I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons fairly few in numbers could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units. >Consider then the effect of removing the National Guard's >infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local >governments. The government-controled select militia could >not fight effectively without infantry support provided by >the general militia (an inherently infantry organization.) >On the other hand the general militia could function (although >at a disadvantage) without the backing of local governments and >the select militia. We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff say tanks offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment. >>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds >>dikes in times of flood sets up disaster relief cities and >>the like. > >I would much rather see these things handled by the local >general militias. So would I but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus we will certainly have to call in others and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else. >Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of >the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to >be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia not the infantry >arm of the regular army. Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks self-propelled artillery and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers 2 1/2 ton trucks HumVee's old M60 tanks 105 Howitzers are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units. Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly local units would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army I'm convinced should have a very minumum of infantry relying on the state and local militias for these functions. < Dan Sorenson DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > <  ISU only censors what I read not what I say.

To draw an analogy Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than say Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business in our eyes in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government in essence this is a cultural difference between us. >IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME. >But should it have to be like that ?? It shouldn't.

Even though I find this to be funny on the surface the original poster of the joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of nuts. This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as nuts or crazies a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we as American's have the gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution to include the 2nd ammendment the government must appease the public's opinion or risk voted out of existance or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself being thrown out by force. Our government as it stands must appease the public.  Therefore the official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did. So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above even though it may be funny may mislead the public from the truth of the matter. Just as an aside  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns) has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations it would be interesting to find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

"2","A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case: 1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is incorrect the operation will fail disastrously. 2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were outgunned they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault was planned we were told that it was because the cultists were thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew you could! 3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI agent.  His opinion of the BATF was ummm well let's just say uncomplimentary. 4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW we're *still* hearing this justification.  AG Reno on CNN yesterday made references to this issue without any substantiation.  She also waved around the He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children! flag.  Sigh. 5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to the edge what the hell did she think their reaction would be to an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD I'd expect the forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In that light whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also look at how the siege was conducted: Bright lights loud rock music cutting off communications and other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it was it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's paranoid delusions. -- #include <std_disclaimer.h> Dan S."

The legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee committee and floor action.  Many important victories however come from coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting legislation is either amended favorably rejected or never voted.

Illinois - HB 90 prohibiting the sale possession manufacture purchase possession or carrying of certain semi-auto firearms was defeated in House Judiciary II Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 91 mandatory storage legislation failed in House Judiciary Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 1550 repeals FOID and makes FTIP point of sale check permanent passed out of Judiciary Committee by a 10-4-2 vote. Presently on the calendar for third reading in the House. SB 40 mandatory storage bill defeated in committee. SB 265 imposing a handgun excise tax failed in Senate committee on Revenue's Subcommittee on Tax Increases. SB 272imposing a tax on all persons engaged in the business of selling firearms failed in Senate Revenue Committee's Subcommittee on Tax Increases.

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds the determined efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April 6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in Madison Wisconsin was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban -- aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on the issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the referendum on the ballot allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to reverse public opinion on the controversial issue. An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found 57% in support and 38% opposed with 5% expressing no opinion.  By election day of the more than 56000 voters who went to the polls 51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign committee spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA relied on neighborhood canvassing direct mail and radio/TV advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved. Despite the surprising defeat it is expected that the Madison initiative's chief proponent Mayor Paul Soglin will attempt to have the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties in the wild?  Granted it is a big part but we also need military style weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door. When ten agents come to my door it would be nice to be able to shoot all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their ability'.  It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you listed above. Please read the Federalist papers for all clarification on RKBA.

Well actually the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves the last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds surrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove burning on such a warm day?  Flame throwers use liquid petroleum napalm is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory the diluted CS gas was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start burning until around 10:00 or 11:00. > THIS IS MURDER!

Anyway here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples' interpretations... 1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business. 2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However I think the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other noncombatants. 3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and if it caused the fire to be started I think the FBI agent responsible should spend 10-20 years in jail. 4. However if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there I hold him largely responsible for their deaths. don"

"2","Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith WEIRD SCIENCE Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase political science is subject to more than one interpretation. Years ago we heard how scientists were worried that a new Ice Age might be coming and later on that nuclear winter -- smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even have killed the dinosaurs. What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended to discredit it that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken values that made America the most successful culture in history and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague when continents drifted together exposing them to new germs. We miss a lot like this unless we listen closely.  Prince William Sound site of the famous oil spill and Mount St. Helen's weren't supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 100 years.  That turned out not to be true although you'd never know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient and that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be. But for once the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of science as they are of everything they trust scientists to unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's scientists have agendas of their own. Nobody in government that wellspring of scientific wherewithal is going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that there is no respectable evidence for global warming.  The money and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit and they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable. The same appears true of acid rain a deliberate hoax cooked up by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on specialists in different fields not talking to each other much. The list goes on always with a common disreputable thread. Ozone depletion for which evidence is even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warming is no more than a last desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have failed and can only find this final withered leg to teeter on. Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism resting on foundations of myth and panic-mongering have failed to erase the fact that nuclear power is the safest cleanest most efficient source of energy known to mankind -- and more to the point that the greater amount of energy there is available to any individual in society the freer that individual -- and his society -- become. Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as ideological opponents to those concepts but which show massive reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have been suppressed most recently by the California state government. And what the media didn't say about recent EPA discoveries on the effect of secondhand smoking is that although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected it was less (by an order or two of magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer. That of course is the real threat represented by politically correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy practice but given a lack of credibility on the part of today's science how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is highly addictive to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There isn't any way to tell thanks to the corrupting influence of government money on the scientific establishment. Two centuries ago the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one time or another by creating a legal barrier between politics and religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of abortion) blood -- real human blood hot and smoking in the street -- has wound up being shed. Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues as people's lives are ruined through the loss to agencies like the EPA of livelihood or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels for electrical power or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates when they die from the effects of obesity. What we need now if we hope to survive as a civilization for two more centuries is another barrier a Constitutional separation of state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies and everyone will benefit. L.

If amnesty was their concern they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not. This way if a gun turns out to be stolen then even if they wanted to prosecute they don't know who to prosecute. Since the only concern of these(HCI and the like) people seems to be the total eradication of guns( legal or illegal ) why should they bother to check for stolen property.  If they knew who the rightful owner is then they would have to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns."

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as perhaps 90 people died before my eyes while the two Huey's fanned the flames and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. Something was VERY wrong with that scene. Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies I might've been dulled to the pain of fellow humans dying. Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was the sadistic mad man they said he was did the others deserve his fate?   If in fact he was mad wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his followers and therefore they were innocent brainwashed victims?  Is there any scenaro that justifies all that death? And if not it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has not FUCKED UP initially and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over the edge. And that's if you buy the latest version of the story hook line and sinker. I have believed all along that they could not let them live the embarrassment to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe. Remember this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no witnesses except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the building and the press could've done their job and would've been able to back the FBI's story with close up video while incurring no risk to the press. Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

The legal way to serve a search warrant is to knock on the door.  Tossing in a grenade to serve a search warrant violates the US Constitution and is hence illegal.  The BD complied with legal search warrants in the past.  I do not understand why the BATF used an illegal means to serve their search warrant last February. - Steve Kao"

IMO 90% of all conspiracy charges are easily explained by the simple fact that in these days of instantaneous news transmission all kinds of stuff gets said when people really just don't know what the hell's going on. Then the story changes once the facts are in and suddenly cries of its all a whitewash! start.

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage the lawsuits the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here? Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical given Koresh's religious orientation for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse. IMHO the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks oops combat engineering vehicles obstensibly to perform gas insertions (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge. Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would at the first sign of preparations for suicide have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the gas insertion right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound gloating over the kill. Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence. The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back abandoned the assault torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought it was totally out of the question.  Not without all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are. Yesterday was a sad sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my very soul.

My heart bleeds just as much as yours for the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities to do so.

I do not think this.  However if they did set the fire (which started in more than one place and spread very quickly) then they got what they wanted and put into motion themselves.

"2","Here is a letter I sent to David Skaggs (Dem CO).  Before anybody says something yes the letter is a bit sharp in tone.  I have been writting reasonable and polite letters to him for years and all I get in return in the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated I don't think that upsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree but recent events in Texas REALLY have me pissed. ------------------- April  20 1993 Representative Skaggs Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) in Texas.  In your response you stated that Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians. My question to you is what grounds would you use to deny them access to firearms?  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total ignorance of the subject and highlights your personal bias against firearms. I say this because there are only two possible paths of gun control which you could have been referencing. Either: 1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the cult have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult! This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of thought crimes.  You and Pat Robertson should really get along. 2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the cult.  Under current US law FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh illegally possessed them he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare. I have heard claims that they were stockpiling weapons.  Yet considering the number of people in the complex even 200+ weapons would not have been out of line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged stockpiling? Face it David Skaggs You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that has passed through Congress yet you claim that you are only for reasonable restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain 250000 PAID members while the NRA has just exceeded 3000000 members.  They are still growing at a rate of 2000 new members per day.

"2","Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station KTVB Channel 7. Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5. Monday April 19 1993 was the fifth day of the trial. Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case. The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_. The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver. Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake Idaho.  The two then met again October 11 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint Idaho to begin a weapons transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said He felt like he (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause. The two later met October 24 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second meeting Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained). The next meeting took place on Nov 30 1989.  Fadeley stated that his source had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad.  Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise. The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus each of these meetings must have been recorded.  However the _Statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must have also been phone taps. These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence Weaver's attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case ...if it has a case at all... according to the rules. Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape. U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained. Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention. Tuesday April 20 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue."

Moreover the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound and as far as I have been able to ascertain those agents were still in the compound when the first shots were fired.  For all we know these two people may BE the agents who would certainly be unlikely to stay around and cook with the faithful... Assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all. Maybe I sound paranoid but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on how much David Koresh was a big bad child abuser and I kept wondering why she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place. I'm POSITIVE that the sealed warrant is not for child abuse.  What was it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE last night about weapons violations.  Why?

"2","Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children. What did the FBI do to defuse the situation  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound shut off their electrical power put their pump out of action assaulted their ears with loud noise cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh. Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks. It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid. Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people. If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today. Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.  Incompetent law enforcement can kill you! -- Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute Boulder CO                    | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short- satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |"

"2","In the interests of completeness I thought readers of these newsgroups would want to see FBI Director William Sessions' statement as released by the FBI press office. FBI Director's Statement On Waco Standoff To: National Desk Contact: Federal Bureau of Investigation Press Office 202-324-3691 WASHINGTON April 19 -- The following is a statement by FBI Director William S. Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian incident in Waco Texas: I had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening. After very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought that today's efforts by the FBI to bring the Branch Davidians out of their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the stand-off or at least meaningful negotiation. Instead we are faced with devastation and death.  However I have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with extreme professionalism and care.  I applaud the restraint shown by agents in the face of life-threatening gunfire and I thank them for risking their lives to try to end this peacefully.  I have only the greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all involved. -30-"

"2","Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended. People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they did in Waco. After all from what I know of the Federalist papers it is this kind of tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against. Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters! We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually if they intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed at that) civilian population we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would have ever thought it would happen here! I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next because the gov. SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine! And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us) if the 2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is and the gov. uses tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here. Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries. Now we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a half of civilians. First they came for the Jews but I did not stop them because I was not a Jew: Then they came for the catholics but I did not stop them because I was not a catholic! Then they came for the lutherans but there was now no one left to stop them! Rev. Martin Niemoller. (probably didn't get it verbatim but you get the idea).

In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed. I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas. > The bulk of firarems are used against unworthy and unnesessary > opponents ... those who posessa a cool jakcet you want those who > would argue with you about a parking space those who would > take your woman.

An interesting idea consider: At any locality where a buy-back program is being instituted get a list of guns they received and compare serial numbers with a list of stolen guns and sue the people responsible for the program if those guns were destroyed.

"2","I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective self-defense but something strikes me as odd among the pro-RKBA arguments presented here. The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity seem valid to me.  Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11000/year?).  However it is surprising that the Evil AntiGun Empire  (Darth Vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare All legitimate gun defenses vs. All gun crimes.  Instead it's always All legitimate gun defenses  which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed and cases in which the criminal is not here vs. just criminal gun homicides which only includes case sin which the victim died. Why is this?  Of course it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured (involving guns) the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate gun defenses one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred. -Case Kim kim39@husc.harvard.edu"

What exactly did I claim? -------------------------------------------------- I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively. -------------------------------------------------- I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the to use your words bullshit filters.  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood. Later in the same post: Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two. Fine *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are inclined to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those claims are still ludicrous however. Previously Awesley had written: You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. Prompting me to write: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags wouldn't you since it makes your other claim seem more plausible. To which Awesley replied: John again strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here you're boring here. But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But that too is ludicrous. I wrote: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it. Awesley relied: Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was several.  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth. Yes if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again without civil libertarians saying this has gone far enough.  So yes my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. Not one poster has written to say yes I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it had happened somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence extraordinary or not. Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I do not. I wrote: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. Awesley wrote: Taking the tour after the riots it was pretty easy to tell the difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up. Quibble.  Fine it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said yes I shelled Americans or I gave the orders to fire the cannons or I helped cover it up? I wrote: If your mind is open enough to believe that well good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.   And here in reality I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells much less fired them. Awesley replied: Given the level in destruction in Detroit I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns. Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known? Awesley concludes: Now then we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the account I cited. Actually now we have established that I don't believe what you believe as well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring then I yield the last word to you if you want it.

I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost.  On the other hand its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses prevented lives from being lost.  In other words the lives_lost is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter number] while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful self defenses.  Clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost. As a semi-related point check out Kleck's Point Blank.

According -> > to the Federalist Paper's a well regulated militia has a well defined -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. -> -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!! Perhaps you should reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the well regulated malitia.  Here is what is says about its character: To oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia It also talks about the well regulated militia having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline. I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states: Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year. But do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force and find a suitable location it requires a continually standing committee of organizers. Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline and meet once or twice a year to train how can you claim a well regulated militia is not well organized.  But I will concide a well organized militia is not necessarily a well regulated militia. Several people have stated that the well organized militia is what is defined under 10 USC 311 which states The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and except as provided in section 313 of title 32 under 45 years of age who are or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizents of the United States who are commissioned officers of the National Guard. This deos define the militia but were is the adjective well regulated. 10 USC 311 does not define a well regualed militia in any way shape or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the well regualed militia as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above it talk above disciplining all the militia of the United States so they fit the character of a well-regulated militia.  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs: It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise: and the experiment if made could not succeed because it would not long be endured. Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the General Welfare clause): Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. So the phrase the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed must either qualify or explain the phrase a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state. The definition of explain as stated in The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language The New College Edition 1982 is: 1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from; elucidate: It was the economists who undertook to explain this puzzle 2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan. 3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify: explain an error The second phrase clearly does not explain the first therefore the second phrase must qualify the first.  The definition given for qualify is: 1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities of; characterize. 2) To make competent or suitable for office position or task. 3) To give legal power to; make legally capable. 4) To modify limit or restrict as giving exceptions. 5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate 6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed does not describe modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power the same thing the Constitution does it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore the right of the people to keep and bear Arms gives legal power to the well regualated militia and this legal power shall not be infringed. I thank you very much Mr Scripter you have provided me with more evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the people's right to form well regulate militia and says very little about the right of an untrained person to keep and bear a .50 caliber machine gun.  And since I totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club) cannot legally buy such a machine gun I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me. -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy -> our Liberties and Rights. I mean to destory our Liberties and Rights.  Is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what our Libertues and Rights are?  I force my version of our Liberties and Rights by begining statements of what our Liberties and Rights with All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me.

Fact:  Regardless of who started the fire there are more than enough things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two. Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?) come to mind. Fact:  It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of law; where death is involved this offense carries a penalty of life in prison. Fact:  Impeachment is allowable for high crimes and misdemeanors. Anything that's a federal felony should qualify.

The BD's were prepared to provide their own heat and light and were doing so for weeks while the power was out.

"2","A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there: Question #1 According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook in Wisconsin it is 'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a concealed and dangerous weapon.  There is no statutory provision for obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.' *  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use. Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so just how 'open' does it have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed or is it just not allowed period? Question #2 As I understand it in Evanston IL they have a ordinance banning handguns. Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending trial for the shooting? Also what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt Marlin). One more thing what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being rich or famous or related to the mayor? Please send replies via E-Mail as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g a little faster than I can handle.  Thanks again -------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------"

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after months of investigation for their raid. I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of 9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15 and M16 assault rifles.

"2","Just to shed some light on the fire it was widely reported (AP etc.) that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp etc. as the cause. What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I believe the moves made were right and proper but I still have some problems with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight as well as CNN and Nightline I question some of the ATF and FBI actions. 1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid? 2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome. 3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers etc.) the right course of action? And a few other questions.  Like I said I believe the actions taken in general were proper.  But I still have some reservations. One other point I'm no fan of Janet Reno but I do like the way she had the balls to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boy had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue."
"2","First I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic. Frankly most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era. This  is most refreshing. Second I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia. Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia both organized and unorganized fits into the defense plans of my State Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state. For instance the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which members report maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar. Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- two (62) years.... The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National Guard the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective. It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion of this para-constitutional arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that at this date the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force. Mississippi and most other States maintains a purely State organized Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia. In time of invasion insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by law but rather by executive order. At one time the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim. >No I simple stated that the people have a right to join a well >organized militia.  And I have also stated that a militia that >meets once or twice a year is clearly well organized.  And this >state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a right >to is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated >by Hamilton. Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum. Others such as Coxe and Henry can be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or train bands were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army which had to be refinanced every two years and iron-clad protection for the Militia which was to remain ever terrible and irresistible. These protections included: State control not Federal; limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions) and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington. These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard. The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the War of 1812 Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy. Further there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer. When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army existing soldiers were grandfathered. At least one of these grandfathered individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts. Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a well organized militia. However the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's definition of well organized. In the period of peace between the French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution. Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not be so bold. Again I wish to repeat. The National Guard for all its merits is not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution. Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The Constitution prohibits States from keeping Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace. I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. Today we call any large vessel a ship but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel.  A ship is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A brig has two masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day those capable of global operations. Today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles. Troops at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. In at least one respect I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia. -- Donald R.

The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior. --"

They had contact with a lawyer so I am inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation actually was.  This also leads to the conspiracy theory that the lawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's acted as witnesses hence the arson.

THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an investigation into the use of excessive force. The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him. A few days afterward Cranston allegedly walked into Wilson's Garage where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON April 20 -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press: 1:36 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective a 51-day standoff ensued. The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing David Koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane. He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound. This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender. I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision. Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued. Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people. I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General to the Justice Department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances. Again I want to say as I did yesterday I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now. Q  Mr. President can you first of all tell us why after 51 days you decided -- Q  Mr. President can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other. Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno -- Q  Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions but I can't do it at once. Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side. I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following: Number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country. Number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out. Number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time. And number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. So for those reasons they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time. The third question I asked was has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco that's the first thing I asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance. Having asked those questions and gotten those answers I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today. Q  Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead. Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely television radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? THE PRESIDENT:  No I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold. There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control. I will say this however.  I was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.) I regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly and I feel awful about the children. But in the end the last comment I had from Janet Reno is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said now I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand. Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way? THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non-political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have. There is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves. Q  Mr. President were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday? THE PRESIDENT:  Well yes I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward. Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought. Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that? THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country. (more more) -30-"
"2","Here is a press release from the White House. President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2): Go ahead Sarah. Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws any number of them. Q  What federal laws -- THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect. They also knew Sarah that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected. In terms of the gas masks themselves I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance. MS. MYERS:  Last question. Q  Mr. President why are you still saying that -- Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong of course we will never know. What happened when I saw the fire when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know. Thank you. Q  Mr. President why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it in the end your decision? THE PRESIDENT:  Well what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow I will support you. And I do support her. She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have. Thank you.  (Applause.) -30-"

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights are not people etc. and it would fly using the logic above. When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis is deliberately difficult and cumbersome to prevent abuse of those who decide to ignore the people or impose unjust policies of a majority on a minority.

The history and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding what happened at Jonestown.

The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California it is over 600 per 100000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100000 a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property without trial under a good faith probable cause standard in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll and a majority will answer yes if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way. According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_ over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco with 400000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the War on Drugs campaign of zero tolerance due process protections have eroded and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.

If you would have read my other post I was accurate.  Here's what I said: [material from another post]------------------------->  The other point that I would like to make because I know it's true (looked this one up in the Illinois this is for you Andy-----> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ statutes before) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in Illinois. ^^^^^^^^ <------ Also for you Andy. And then I went on to say: There is no such thing as a CCW for us ordinary folk here. [end of quoted material] Of course I forgot to mention who us ordinary folk are so just for Andy I'm going to go to the library tomorrow and photocopy the part of the Illinois statutes with this information and post it.  Ordinary citizens CAN NOT get a license to carry a concealed weapon.  There are very few people who can.  I even asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain people can get licenses for concealed carry.  He couldn't remember which people but he knew for sure that regular citizens couldn't get that type of license.  He told me to go check at the library for the statutes which I did.  I'll post that info tomorrow night.  Until then....... Jason"

Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic nuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of people if released in a city similarly populated area resevoir or cropland. Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there is no use not related to weaponry.

"2","Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on something I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok.  Unfortunately most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I intend to put together what I call the American Horror File: a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling artery-bursting red-hot enraged at their government. The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years.  This book will be distributed at cost and I will encourage people to post copies to BBS's send copies on disk to friends and print out copies and give them to neighbors. This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer information that is well-documented with sources given about specific instances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to join me in collecting and researching information for this project. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin S.

"2","oldham@ces.cwru.edu (Daniel Oldham) babbles: What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened. If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the warrant like the Sheriff had done 3 other times they wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been able to have told such heroic stories about how they protected the rest of us from a group of people who kept to themselves miles out in the prairie. The BATF needs more people better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job. The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic. With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Well I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement so I'll just let it pass for now. Case Western reserve huh?  Do the Feds know about that big stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard Drive?  Just so they get the address right that is... Look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of ours. Well it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure. I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was in Viet Nam.  I can assure you none of us fought to protect the right of the government to attack its own citizens with military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in Iraq or Syria...) With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later. This is a joke right?  Or are they really letting fools like you into CWRU now?  Too bad. Used to be a good school.  How'd you get in anyway did your old man buy a new wing for the library?"

The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours. I don't know if you have ever been around CS but I have.  Being exposed to CS gas was part of my Army training so I know that without a mask it VERY uncomfortable and makes your eyes water nose run and makes you sick in the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less eat.  So my question now is why were they cooking food? I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire. But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more crazy than the ATF/FBI claim). Michael"

Maybe they KNEW that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are trying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing on the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case.

Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class. I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments have been banning or trying to ban because they have no sporting purpose and no provate citizen would ever need these guns DO fall under the protection of the Second. So given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at some time been used by the military even if only for marksmanship training purposes I need to understand why you are intent on pressing this point arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second. > Just because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not > mean that I oppose the RKBA.

Try reading USCA on >the Constitution or get any other CORRECT version of the >Constitution. There are several ways in which one can choose to intrepret any constitutational issue : (a) Original intent (b) Subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whims of the day. If we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution it is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen be allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day. For references I cite : - Federalist papers - The Embarassing Second Ammendment Yale Law Review Prof. Stanford Levinson [sorry I don't have the date handy] Prof Levinson sought to prove that the 2nd ammendment did not convey an individual right but concluded that it did hence the embarassing in his title. - Report of the Subcomittee on the Consititution United States Sendate 97th Congress Second Session February 1982. - U.S. vs. Verguido Urguidez (Supreme court case in recent years). Although this case did not pertain to firearms Justice Rhenquist notes that the term the people is a term of art conveying individual rights and specifically cited several used 2nd ammentment included in his opinion. - Title 10 U.S. Code.  This states that all males between the ages of 18 & 45 not part of the organized militia and all female officers of the national guard are part of the unorganized militia. Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have to support your position.  I could go on a greater length with my personal proof by assertion however such a technique would carry no more or less weight that your dubious proofs by assertion."

"2","The following is quoted from the tail end of a (rather condescending) article about Paxton Quigley that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies (sorry... i think it was in the wall street journal...) and was repeated in the Colorado (people's) Daily a student newspaper at the University of Colorado at Boulder. A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County Wash. found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder.  Studies by the Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh found that the mere presence of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member will commit suicide even in the absence of psychiatric illness. I have seen these numbers quoted before and I have seen very specific refutation of them quoted as well.  If someone will be so kind as to email the relevant information I will write a letter to the editor of the Co. Daily (which might get published) and send a copy to USN&WR as well.

Therefore the right >of the people to keep and bear Arms gives legal power to the well >regualated militia and this legal power shall not be infringed. Ah clarification by obfuscation. Actually the words A well regulated Milita being necessary to the security of a free state is a present participle used as an adjective to modify 'militia' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence the subject being 'the right' the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE as in you and me as in the First Fourth Ninth Tenth as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL. >So in effort not to force my views and not to destory our Liberties and >Rights  I state that nothing I have written or will write in >the matter of Liberties and Rights is the final word.

"2","This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list. ============================================================== Hi Folks; Wednesday marked day 2 the beginning of the trial.  Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense each side presenting its version of what happenned last August. The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the evil federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents sawed off shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated good faith efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution three people were taking an offensive action against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver. The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not as the prosecution alleged want to become a regular supplier).  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to look at the body [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper. Prosecution quote: Weaver wanted that confrontation and he made that confrontation. -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist Defense quote: The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!] Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including Tim again.  Tim claimed he was a skinhead who were ordinary working class people.  He also claimed he was for white pride not white power. Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver. In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_ about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence during his 90-minute opening statement repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death) and Spence compared the sawed off shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!). Today (Thursday April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.

"2","This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list. ============================================================= Hi Folks; Thursday April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial. This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution. The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution. Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this deputies Cooper William Degan and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites. Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond. Striker the Weaver's yellow lab started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area. They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the fern field] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be shot in the back. As Degan reached the Y he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire. At this moment Striker reached Degan and Cooper had to fend him off with his gun.  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road Degan got up on one knee raised his gun and shouted Stop!  U.S. Marshal!  Harris then ...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back and I knew he had been hit.  Cooper fired at Harris and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel but did not fire.  At this point Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots yelled You son of a bitch! and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery counted two or three beats and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin. On cross-examination David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley asking You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog didn't you?  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available]. Friday April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper. Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

The Administration has given no indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that the president attorney general and governor were all involved in the decisions that led to the Waco Massacre they should also suspend all activities regarding law enforcement.

Perhaps you've been under a rock since say the turn of the century. How in the #$^& is one man supposed to review every single freaking governmental action every day? That's why we have an executive branch. HE reviewed the plan and said go but he wasn't the architect and he wasn't there bullhorn in hand implementing it. Yes he was responsible in the sense that he was briefed. So what! Shit happens.

After lighting the fire we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can.  We heard pops one solid bang and several fizzzz shussss.

I don't recall seeing BATF agents higher than the roof of the lowest structures so I made an assumption that BATF helos did the firing down into the tower. Any other info on how the rounds came through the roof?"

Get a life and chill on the paranoia. I am not a paranoid nor a government toady nor even am I the guy you were talking to originally but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION. A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not that wierd in Texas.  My own family very quiet taxpayers with extremely con- ventional views has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person home.  Some of them were mine but I don't live there anymore.  I now have my own shotgun in my apartment. Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no I repeat NO evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD and is saying that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives. It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup. Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this) to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons. I feel they were all loonies but there is no indication that they ever bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage then that is up to the officers of the state of Texas who are probably getting a per- verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something in their state. semper fi Jammer Jim Miller Texas A&M University '89 and '91 ________________________________________________________________________________ I don't speak for UH which is too bad because they could use the help.

The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins of the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was crushed the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off. Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee that's kind of consistent with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm... : And if the government did start the fire then why weren't people trying : to get out of the compound? Remember PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building. Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they thought it was just a normal fire they would probably be trying to put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and concussion I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable of moving. : And besides... oh I don't know why I'm even bothering. Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened listen to the things that the FBI said (The BD's started the fire.  The BD's bodies were found with gunshot wounds.) that are now being refuted by the evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making statements that have no rational basis in fact and trying to make them sound like fact. : I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe : a murderous heavily-armed religious cult despite much evidence to the : contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under : the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still : prefer to believe the cultists? Yes I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop string of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations on numerous occasions. And as for the BD's being murderous they did not cause any problems until they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If the BATF had never stormed that farm would four agents and 90 BD's be dead today? : (No I don't really expect a response to that challenge.) : >But then : >again that is how Mr. Clinton was elected by people who believe that : >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office. : Um isn't that how all politicians are elected? Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary isn't it.  Now if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of apologizing and denying that he ever made them and actually expected accountability by our government I doubt that debacles like Waco would happen as often as they do. : So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty : people? Are they like just plain evil or what? Did they just wake up : one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the United States : to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know. Acutally no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review. Oddly enough their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after the initial raid on the BD's.  Coincidence?  I think not! And as for the fire what happened was caused by the act of knocking over walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince the world it was suicide but all of the facts that are coming out by the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to cover its ass. : And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he : on diabolical laughter?

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care. Many cult members will probably side with the attorney and if he is lying change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also lie the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds. Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort. For me though the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon so I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus being persecuted by the authorities and had followers to hold onto so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  Thsi conclusion I came to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio shows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise). -- <><><><><><><><><><> Personal opinions?

Two notes of interest from Texas: The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black. The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as those fucking cowboys.  The DPS was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as traffic cops.  ATF now has two strikes against them. Finally (I guess that makes three notes) rumour from Waco is that four ATF agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the flashed an automatic weapon at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF. -- Dillon Pyron                      | The opinions expressed are those of the TI/DSEG Lewisville VAX Support    | sender unless otherwise stated.

In this case it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians would have burned no matter what ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).

"2","The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start violence. When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back. But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical attention that the BD were not looking for trouble. If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc. A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It appears that the BD were not violent they shot back at the attacking ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor. All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents not the BD. -- Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute Boulder CO                    | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short- satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |"
"2","Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once. This may have occurred in the BD compound I have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough and broke through the walls it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire. Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room. I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final assault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the FBI overcoming the forces of evil aka the Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove that they were not using excessive force. -- Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute Boulder CO                    | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short- satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |"

I suppose I didn't make myself clear cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose the authorities might have been a better term than society.  Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in) and expect at the very least to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves. In a few other parts of our society handguns are banned or so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law- abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny though how the criminals in such places continue to have a lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them. IMHO you don't need to be either a political philosopher or a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun- grabbers' logic. Agreed. You're welcome to your HO too the First Amendment being as important as the Second but please don't let your obvious good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities about something as big and diverse as US society. My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload of trouble should you be forced to use them. Or by the naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause to someone who would be a criminal anyway. I made no such statements nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook. Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself if others' thoughts are not that kindly That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace or to have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.

So far the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  If this continues to be the case it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story wouldn't it?  And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch a bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  The bullet hardly moves it is the brass casing that goes flying and then with less than lethal force.  It will hurt yes but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate a coat for example. How about an INDEPENDENT investigation with full subpoena powers and powers to prosecute on felony charges to investigate for any possible illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?  I cannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use so often if they have nothing to hide... they should welcome it and vigorously support it.

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a *stastically serious problem* and even if you don't use these deaths as a justification for gun control these groups do.  I'm sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures I think the conclusion was a reasonable one. The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking. >>Please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good. >> > My point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police >departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by >giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond >to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.

I thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence. >>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics - I >>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135000 is the number of >>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >>to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students >>who carry a gun to school daily. >> > Well Joe I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence What the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL METHODS per year?

The agency that funded the study of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban had saved X lives (yes they actually gave us a number) on the basis of a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?

There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I saw however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more likely however is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines allowing the gas to spread unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks) until reaching a flame or spark and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas especially semi-rural areas. > 	Further the BD members have as much reason to lie as the > 	Gov't.

As far as I am concerned I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise.

Covey Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force~ 2/4/93 WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County Washington found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further as with motor vehicles we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls the NEJM stat is not very helpful here. The NEJM finding purports to inform us but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you a loved one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination  should you not take the bus? Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business: The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths 42 criminal homicides and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted. The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts: 1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members dear friends and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash. 2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent criminal or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk. 3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect and this obscures -- indeed disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again by tautology gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway without the guns.  In any case people are the death-dealing agents the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter. 4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County including those outside the home in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al. The Human Side of Homicide  Columbia University Press 1982;  Charles Rich et al.  ~Guns and Suicide~  American Journal of Psychiatry  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue. 5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures like the NEJM homicide rate are based on the immediate disposition of cases. But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18 1993 cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17 1989 cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14 1990 update Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled apprehended or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America  Aldine de Gruyter 1992)? Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense homicides suicides and accidents) yields 33.  Thus we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat: A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody. Of course Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. Clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned  even critically. -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

And about stockpiling weapons/food many recognized religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food and some even maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition why are those two facts grounds for an armed assault?

I think it was - he went into town fairly often and was known to go jogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being watched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead when they had been warned according to an interview with a BATF agent that the BD were expecting them and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted to have a romp and a nice show for the media and it all went to hell... He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered peacefully before (but of course the warrants were served peacefully). He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY. The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased $200000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period). Last I heard this is not a crime or indication of one.  I know of an INDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door shoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first nobody I know of can say 'oh thats only a stun grenade thats OK...').  Can you? I sure cannot.  Also one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated like the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so it is a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the BATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved religeous group.

I am inclined to think a further wait would have saved lives.

Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building had pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision the firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't the Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough...

You think she is going to be facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think she is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to have acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick though. I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI. I expect to hear they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't do anything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue. I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation with full prosecuting and subpoena powers.  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found. Fat chance I bet.

As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get any closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting for themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise missile land in the lobby. Incidentally has that ever been explained or are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course missile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about 1 in some very large number?

Are you saying that the Indians who became Christians did so because the US Army marched them into church at gunpoint? This will be news to the Indians of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi basin-- of the Southwest-- of Mexico and South America-- who converted even before there was such a thing as the US.  Are you saying that Indians are incapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without being forced to at gunpoint?  What about the Christian Cherokees who were given the boot by the US government after the Civil War... because the Cherokee nation gave mild support to the Confederacy since they themselves owned black slaves.  No reducing it all to a matter of religion is to support a much too narrow view of history. I've never heard of a single treaty whether broken by the US government or not (were any NOT????) that said if you guys convert to Christianity you get to keep all the land you claim.  No treaties were invariably about land... it meant ceding Indian claims to the government.  Sometimes in return the US government promised the hunter-gatherer tribes (and plenty of tribes were already farming for centuries but we don't hear about non-Plains Indians in movies) food and training in return for taking up a non-nomadic existence. Promises of course which all to often proved empty."

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available) and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS Ch 1993) I could synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities.  As also noted the knowledge is there for the production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The only thing is the expense. Now I'm not going around making these things but it's not 'cause of any law; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the case of chemical agents I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used. Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin etc. is that they have very valid commercial uses and it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it. >>< Dan Sorenson DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > >><  ISU only censors what I read not what I say.

I will NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply) tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??) methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first) and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF then the FBI having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid criminal negligence murder civil rights violations and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for BATF wrongdoing. James btw if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability. -- ******************************************************************************** James S.

They threatened no one.  Their neighbours thought they were a little strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live next door to. One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof that these guys were police  the 'cult' had every right to defend themselves. : Torching themselves shows briliant tactics and convinces me : they *realy* belong in society ... If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it is not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is claiming that the 'cult' started the fire. 'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but I'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say about it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same. Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident: 1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw on CNN at least three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to be police. 2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning: + We only had handguns - the original footage showed 4 BATF officers on a roof top getting shot at  one had an MP-5 assault sub-machine gun. + We were out gunned - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the BEST in quarters weapon  you can't be out gunned when you have the best guns available for the job. + We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors! - this one is the best  there are very few guns that won't shoot through a household door  or through a house WALL for that matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and *Firearms* should know that  they are either lying or incredibly incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter plywood. + We had a search warrant.  Actually we had an arrest warrant. No wait  we had both.  Yeah that's the ticket. Oh and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*. Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers. - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous. 3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh? All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be taken with a grain or two of salt.

Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did not break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense except the fire seemed to spread too quickly even given the nature of the buildings and the very high winds.  And it was daylight but I guess in the innner recesses it could be dark--shutters probably closed as well. Which puts us back to the FBI did it or the BD did it or some other screw- up occured which is quite possible. The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires *everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave like total idiots that does not make them homocidal maniacs either.  And if it was one nutcase agent then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency. I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire but I'm far from convinced he actually did so.

This is taken a little out of context and I'm not flaming Jason...it's just that this was the proverbial straw....

Why wouldn't they have gone out in the proverbial blaze of glory and come out shooting with an attitude of let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us? Instead they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in store for them at the government's hands. It's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy all fanatics all followers of the antichrist haters of the government practicers of weird lifestyles or whatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing their beliefs however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to you and me. There is much precedent for such devotion to cause. My conclusion at this point is that the authorities seriously misread their danger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chose this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda up to and including AG J. Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood. Some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what they perceive as the godless government. When I force myself to not judge others by my own personal standards and beliefs I can almost admire their stand.

"2","|Question #2 |As I understand it in Evanston IL they have a ordinance banning handguns. |Is there any way to get around this provision? Why don't you call the City and ask? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well but does allow those with a collectors FFL to possess (collectible?) handguns. |What would the penalty if you were found out be? Probably a fine in practical terms. |What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment |there?  How would the city law apply to your impending |trial for the shooting? It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house and told him: this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you. Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him his home or family. |Also what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled |shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available |either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt Marlin). L.V. Cipriani states that the Any other weapon category is allowed but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular which I believe is in the Any other weapon category and a chopped barrel H&K HK-94 (Class 3 for sure) is not clear to me... |One more thing what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being |rich or famous or related to the mayor? In your dreams buddy. As long as Democrats reign in Chicago Illinois residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry concealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes out of office; because the Dems are always in power the Illinois Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list Karl Kleinpaste has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates Wright Tonso Levinson Supreme Court Decisions the RIA vs US decision copies of legislation and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here. So in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here. Instructions: Short version for techies: The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get put mget or mput should work.  Give the command type binary to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget. I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived. Long version for non-techies: In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command: ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login: Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc): Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with: ftp Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address: Guest login ok send e-mail address as password: I would enter: l.v.cipriani@att.com You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output: Remote system is UNIX. Using binary mode to transfer files. Next the command prompt is printed: ftp> If you do not get the line Using binary mode to transfer files. Run the command: type binary Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming There are subdirectories to the rkba directory those are discussed below. When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command: cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command: cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command. To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command: ls -l This will produce something like: total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ... Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left the fields are the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in bytes and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with. To get a file run the command get followed by the name of the file you want for example: get INDEX or get noduty After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this: Transfer complete. 19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s) You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory for example congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it: cd congress/103rd get HR1025 Once you're finished you can log off with the command: quit If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw White Man's Law by William R. Tonso from the December 1985 Reason magazine ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command: put file_name In this case: put whitemanslaw Again there'll be a Transfer complete so many bytes transfered in so many seconds message.  Now your file is on the archive machine. Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message]. Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory. Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file. If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest. If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed so be sure to let me know first. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com -- Michael Phelps (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

"2","On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to tear gas the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If there had been anything in the way corners to negotiate doors to open or any other obstacles to movement I would have had a difficult time exiting the chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with respiratory problems and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic. If they could have found the door having them staggering out retching wouldn't be too far fetched.  Throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and subject to psychological warfare and all bets on functional abilities are off.

(Flames to /dev/null) --------- Begin Enclosed Article ----------- THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT by J. Neil Schulman If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang you'd ring up Carl Sagan right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ? That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of American Usage and Style: The Consensus. A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise. Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952 Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for Editor and Publisher a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field. He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage American Usage and Style: The Consensus has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981 and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award. That sounds like an expert to me. After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested I sent the following letter: I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and extract the intent from the text. The text of the Second Amendment is 'A well-regulated Militia being necessary for the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.' The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence 'A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State' is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.' I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary. My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment then concluded: I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because as a citizen I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results I ask that you do this because of that importance. After several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment gun control or any other political subject Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity): [Copperud:] The words 'A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26 1991 constitutes a present participle rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective modifying 'militia' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right' verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia. In reply to your numbered questions: [Schulman:] (1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'? [Copperud:] (1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people. [Schulman:] (2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'? [Copperud:] (2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia. [Schulman:] (3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free State and if that condition is not existing is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed' null and void? [Copperud:] (3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence. [Schulman:] (4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence? [Copperud:] (4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia. [Schulman:] (5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped' 'well-organized' 'well-drilled' 'well-educated' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'? [Copperud:] (5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military. [Schulman:] (6) (If at all possible I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written 200 years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated. [Copperud:] To the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today it might be put: Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.' [Schulman:] As a 'scientific control' on this analysis I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence A well-schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and read Books shall not be infringed.' My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be (1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and (2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example registered voters with a high-school diploma? [Copperud:] (1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure. (2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation. Professor Copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter: With well-known human curiosity I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion. So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right. As I write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power. And here in the United States elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Constitution. And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights stands by and does nothing. it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ? Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives our fortuned and our sacred honor ?

Regulated means controlled! How about security? While it may mean that in 1993 the relevant meaning comes from 1789. Moreover controlled doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling. Fletcher's Political Works pub'd in 1749 defines a well-regulated militia that being the relevant phrase as being an armed people NOT under the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the constituion used it in that way. Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than individual right not to be interfered with by govt. Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on govt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review article for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated militia is a necessary part of that restriction but it is not sufficient. -andy --"

"2","|QUESTION: |What will Californians do with all those guns after the Reginald |denny trial? The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining about all the new guns; excuse me but police are EMPLOYEES of the government. Rather like having your janitor complain about job conditions. I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage in coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based on the nefarious tipster theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city streets with incendiary weapons acetylene after slowing them down with abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass BATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs and there should be enough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war operation... yes a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton would get what he wanted a War on Gunowners the BATF would attempt to show the anti-gun press they they really REALLY were in charge with a 500-man Charge of the Light Brigade and the FBI would attempt to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian National Guard to level the area with artillary! :-) :-) :-)"

THAT was my point to Joe who said that anti-gunners try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem. No I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.

I'm not saying if that is a good thing or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program they say well no...  So in answer to your question no false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look if you can't measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community.

"2","Folks It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV radio and newprint media.  Ideally these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and hopefully wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging at my gut.  The list will probably grow. 1.   What were the contents of the original warrant now sealed that the BATF obtained? 2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore a no-knock raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the complex did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law? 3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex BATF agents were aware that several small children were inside the buildings. In the ensueing gun battle BATF agents fired into a building known to contain children killing at least one two-year old child. Knowing children were present why didn't the BATF have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over $200000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms License were they actively participating in the legal business of selling/buying firearms and ammunition and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons. 5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed a BATF spokeswoman stated We were outgunned!.  Yet TV newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's bodies they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s) of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex? 6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily why did the FBI treat it as a hostage situation? 7.   Along the same lines why did the FBI use psychological warfare techniques including sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind? 8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out why did the FBI expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities? 9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location. Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated? 10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI have that a mass suicide pact existed? 11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business? 12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is there any factual basis to this rumor and if so what charges will be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act? 13.  FBI Director Sessions states that during the final assault on the complex over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.  On the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines.  Yet there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also there are no indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely these should be evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles. Finally the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high-power rifles? 14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United States has signed international treaties which prevent the use of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land? 15.  On April 21 FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22 the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head? -- ************************************************************** * Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com * * Senior Customer Engineer                                   * * Intergraph Electronics                                     * * 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 * * Mountain View CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 * **************************************************************"

"2","Having read the posted long article by JPFO I have some observations: 1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a verbatim translation of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence they talk about how in that book they reproduce the German text of the Nazi law together with its translation.  Not surprisingly a reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough that's what the whole thing has mutated into urban-folklore style. 2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a copy of the Nazi law either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating but I don't understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and yet in a paragraph towards the end he explains it perfectly: If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg it likely was part of a collection of documents for example issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry]. Bingo.  Exactly. Dodd had a *book* with a series of Nazi laws in it including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law? melts away by the author's admission.  He then continues:  But if he acquired the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg he must have done so for a very specific reason...  But there's absolutely no reason to think that this is the case.  In fact as a senior member of the U.S. team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is certainly according to the author here) or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it can be put aside as red herrings. 3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he asked to have it translated.  The problem is in the context of the charge levelled at Dodd these two things work *against* each other.  People ask to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing it into American law surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant* wouldn't he? Anyway this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own? Once again the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the Nazi law.  In fact since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record under the heading of documents concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation Dodd's motivation isn't a mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR. 4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law. Registration of guns for instance was begun in 1928 and thus NOT a Nazi-inspired idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort and the identification of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list other parts of the Nazi law forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters immediately after the discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law the JPFO article continues Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68... -- so as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law. -- -- Don Porges porges@inmet.camb.inmet.com ..uunet!inmet!porges"

"2","hello I just want to make 2 points: 1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence education loyalty to the government etc. They are given much intensive training. So to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here and say that the FBI was just stupid I say I don't believe it. 2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of Koresh saying light the fire and you can have one. Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires and through the magic of computer graphics you can have one. The thing is manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any FBI video is because it is: 1) classified 2) too gruesome for our eyes 3) lost/got coffee spilled on it Dwayne Jacques Fontenot BTW I get my information from live video feeds. I read the papers too but almost everything in them contradicts what I have seen with my own eyes."

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house making sure women and children were secure and checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours the compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped. This is their story gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world since Koresh's right-hand man Steve Schneider ripped out the compounds's phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out. They kept their word. By dawn tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children all under 10 remained by their mothers' sides. Still it was hard to ignore what was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber lined with cinder blocks where authorities hoped to find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them. Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members in separate discussions with lawyers consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of propane spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house it tipped over lit lanterns spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables. The home of used lumber plywood and wallboard tacked together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others died groping in the blackness. Frank"

The number bounces between 2% and 18% depending on the study quoted and the type of gun being studied.

Wright (1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct sources of handguns for adult felony offenders. Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six -- obtained them via informal off-the-record transactions involving friends and associates family members and various black market outlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase swaps and trades borrowing and renting and often theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply. --------------------------------------- INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91 Independence Institute 14142 Denver West Parkway #101 Golden CO 80401 (303) 279-6536 WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY By David B. Kopel The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville. The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals.[51]  In short waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers. 51. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Assistant Director of Criminal Enforcement Memorandum to Director July 10 1975 (Greenville survey; of 20047 names submitted to FBI for record checks 68 had felony convictions; of those 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted) (of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution .9% had non-violent felony convictions and .4% had violent convictions).

The NU study authored by sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The figures included purchases by legal surrogates rather than directly by the criminal.) Wright and Rossi who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases and probably not even full scale gun prohibition would reduce criminal use of guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns and leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly Wright believes that the consequences of current assault weapon legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business.{100} 6.   _See _e.g. The Anti-drug Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

The used to kill is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of I'm sure is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there or a tragic accident especially involving a child. Unfortunately that's not the way things stack up.  The majority of that 43 times (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is someone intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies as well as comparative studies with other countries indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan for instance has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.) According to the National Crime Survey 40% of violent crime is commited by non-strangers which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean Friends and family.  That is Mr. Quigley and others who quote this statistic are banking on the mental image that a Friend family member or child equates to a loving relationship and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately all too often husbands beat and kill wives children assault parents or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by someone known to the victim for instance.  Essentially that a gun was used against a friend or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families and those are also the areas most at risk for family problems especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might. Finally it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed. Not it also confines itself to the home where attack by a friend or family member is far far more likely and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.) >Studies by the >Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh found that the mere presence >of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member >will commit suicide even in the absence of psychiatric illness. I have not seen the exact data for this so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates. There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph and surprise surprise surprise they published it.  The text follows. The Colorado Daily btw is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup but every little bit i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) Gun Stats The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley author of Armed and Female.  The article in turn cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The article states A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder.  This is an often-quoted statistic and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons outlined below: The study gives the impression that if you own a gun the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you.  The study however fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork every month the second your grandmother cashes her social security check.  Possibly an acquaintance but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample size (396) taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used successfully by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual.

"2","Well the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. Unfortunately dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits required approval of a deputy chief who was not available (literally out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little too late; there were just two pumpers and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the line of fire it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a difference. They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded but probably irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that no local calls could get through. ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the standard pool shot) and agreed that the fire a) must have been started in at least 3 places and b) must have had an accelerant to spread so fast. Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed themselves more than the FBI offed them but it's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the theories floating around the net.

Personally if the fire was set (by either side) I wonder about the timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires why wait through six hours of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything new that happened just around that point?  Similarly if the FBI were going to torch the place (and fake it of course) why wait so long wouldn't it be more reasonable to believe the BD's would set the fire early after the assault began? The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things I say that because I was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter (watching from a distance of course) said that it looked like at least one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously. Specifically he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been penetrating a few feet. reserving judgement -Aaron"

That is the prime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue. Since the Congress has the authority to levy taxes the NFA is a tax act and the registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection. U.S.C 922 in order to be constitutional must have a basis on a particular authority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can not arbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into effect only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality of law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was never constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law being unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct me if I'm wrong but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional anyone convicted of breaking that law is absolved. I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.  NFA has been invalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellate level{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory  and U.S. vs Dalton})."

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury not justice.  If they needed to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the federal marshalls service their fugitive collection teams do similar type assaults all the time.  And they are very very good about it in both the tactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would not have touched it because the search warrant (which is still sealed I believe) was so bogus. Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby large city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own guys nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun control. I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their assault weapon confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line); right around the presidents 100th day in office.

"2","jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu: Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such but the average person and average thug would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would pay through the nose for it. Good point you make.  However a zip gun by definition is a crude homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained accurate fire but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns. Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite the Sten gun was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing hand tools and a welder. I still think that while the point is good I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned I think the demand for real guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms and bad guys will continue to have access to them one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation. -- Allan J. Heim   allanh@sco.COM   ...!uunet!sco!allanh   +1 408 427 7813"

"2","Hi In Canada any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the National Parks.  Instead one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances of hiking in bear country and take the appropriate precautions. I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer to Nature that they are a part of Nature and as such have to deal with nature on it's own terms. Guy"

Forensic experts will study the rubble and ashes of the Branch Davidian compound where at least 85 people including 24 children perished in smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of a manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN JUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. [emphasis added by me] Investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit. But the public must question why agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader David Koresh whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of arms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of rationality could be expected from Koresh a self- confsesed sinner without equal. What continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents who bungled the case from the start.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol To- bacco and Firearms storemd the compound intent on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored. Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound. It had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside Rancho Apocalypse were essentially hostages.  With their lives at stake there was no reason for the government to be impatient.  The government's superior firepower control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience. If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr. etc etc tec.... [paragraphs 2.5 paragraphs deleted] But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on WAco. If Reno is to be faulted for anything ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers--a common problem among prosecutors. Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze started.  Though apportioning blame will play a role it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time. [end of editorial] -J. Case Kim kim39@husc.harvard.edu"

You see that this individual has a submachinegun and that more similarly armed individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family against this attack b) realize oh only the BATF would enter like that so I better surrender or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do what they would like?  You have chosen a) and discover that the people you defended yourself against are federal agents who now are camped outside your door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to charge you with murder and are further defaming your name while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological warfare techniques against you while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff you are still holding out when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender namely using tear gas to annoy you and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest round of attacks your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as cover spread the fire rapidly through the house and you try to escape through the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it. I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant. Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources the FBI blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound and are now playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault obtained the use of Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations and compounded their abuses by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault. -- ******************************************************************************** James S.

Most of all I enjoy the thought that I have the means and can exercise my rights to defend me and mine. And I want to thank all of you good folks like Prescod who remind me of what I have.  Along this line I watched a documentary on one of the Nazi concentration camps.  Stacks and stacks of bodies.  There were scenes of Hitler speechifying and what struck me was the reverence and adoration on the faces of the people in the crowds.  I guess they were happy that Hitler had implemented full gun control and was taking care of the Jewish problem all at the same time. ---lee"

Oh well that couldn't have been your point then. If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons then the ATF wouldn't have felt threatened and had to move in.  Here's a newsflash:  It isn't illegal to own more than one firearm.  It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms. They shot federales?  The feds shot them too. How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.

"2","For those who didn't figure it out the below message was a reply to another in sci.crypt for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. I didn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused. The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages. However I don't wish to enter into this discussion here as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of well-regulated in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control and disciplined and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which well regulated unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship' and not under control/disciplined etc. Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not an 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular forum. To avoid flames or unproductive rehashings I note that I've come in here to post this one message just to clarify the one below. I'm now outta here again though I'm available via e-mail.

Look I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on and afterwards you can't just shut it off -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.

You have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of strict gun control there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.

They finally realize that they need to put criminals away longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun law.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how easy criminals get off ) In the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal) watching him on tv just laughing his ass off.

I would reviewing other cases I've seen reported on in the articles I've read etc.. suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!) Repeat this process three timesif you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism it's practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45) IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!) call the police and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court. (ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate not ricochette and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee to bad the two often cross damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with one shot. This again can be a real life saver in a hostile court. Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were. Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts and unfortunately to see if your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are required in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one contact the NRA. They have a legal assistance fund.(Or at least they used to) I DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER! (Not my business either way though..)

"2","Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have wondered If it wasn't suicide why did so few get out?  The answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the chemical weapons treaty. The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in wartime but used it in peacetime against civilians including nnocent children. For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George Stephanopoulous posted in alt.news-media and other locations.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is good or at least better than the alternative. >But let's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents. Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1] and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns not handguns. ... >But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you >can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range. In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people even for self defense would I'm sure come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it and might even kill them but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people. >This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show >someone  that you have a gun and they go Gee perhaps I should leave. In fact that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot and will go to some effort not to be including doing what you say when you point a gun at them. If you were called on to design a tool that could be easily carried to immediately stop someone attacking you what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3] >No you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human >body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow for most. Certainly no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right but my duty to defend myself and my family and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government. - T. Jefferson. I think what Jefferson said is still true. >And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes >off into the wrong fleshy target. Not very often compared to other use.[3] >Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife. This isn't that common either at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly get-pissed and kill someone gun or not.  In most cases the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun feel free to present it. >Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to >kill things.  Right? Right but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows and when I do I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly but failing that I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot and failing that I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns particularly handguns haven't used them much for that purpose.

Michigan Avenue Chicago IL  606111  (800) 621-7619 [2] RKBA.002 - Declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms Version 1.1 (last changed on 90/04/23 at 22:28:19) DESCRIPTION =========== The accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily for almost sixty years. In 1932 the accidental deaths by firearm per 1000000 people was 24.03. In 1987 it was 5.74. The decline has been steady consistent and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate of the last sixty years it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD. CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over sixty years despite rising per-capita gun ownership. [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths.

"2","Ok here goes.  Yes folks I realize I have stuck my foot in my mouth quite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications.  My inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge.  Thanks to you kind (and some not so kind) people I am learning.   Some people have given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was wrong. In no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to further the anti-gun cause.  I have said several times before (but nobody seemed to be listening) that I am pro-gun and anti-gun-control. As far as the race can of worms that I have opened up I have only one thing to say - I am in no way prejudiced.  Some of the things I have stated were said to demonstrate that I am not prejudiced and/or a racist but I have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced.  I will not say anymore about that subject because no matter what I say it will be the wrong thing. Boy what a start to being on a new group.  Oh well things have been worse in my life.

If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due to the heat a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate. In fire aftermaths bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up such scenes. As such if the body had been suitably cooked a bullet comming from a magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the time of death or much later unless you were trained to look for the evidence.

"2","Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith THE LIES OF TEXAS Okay what have we learned? For reasons still being kept secret a federal agency already known -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years -- for a longstanding violent disregard of the law invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate violating his rights under the First Second Fourth Fifth Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The man and his followers fight back killing four of the outlaw agency's minions wounding many more and suffering their own losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his electricity water and especially his contact with the outside world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for straightening out the mess -- and more importantly to script his side of the subsequent negotiations any way they please. The impasse lasts almost two months ironically at the same time four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. Armored vehicles surround the house already ringed with snipers using scoped high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume and searchlights deprive those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique originated by North Korean Communists as a battle tactic may have had on their judgment). Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising of the Warsaw Ghetto some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives including those of more than a dozen children are snuffed out. Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies the Attorney General and the President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: blame the victim. He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being examined by the agency that created them. He was abusing children -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that Jim Jones? Best of all he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to embarrass us any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole travesty. A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? Very well what can we infer from the above? For starters never forget that although Democratic careers are on the line (and rightfully so) over this fiasco by the outlaw agency's admission it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which may explain why Paul Harvey who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. More importantly when Rush Limbaugh who's been a quivering tower of Jello during the whole thing takes essentially the same stance as Bill Clinton it's time for fundamental changes if not in the system then at least within yourself. On March 5 back at the beginning Mary Gingell national chair of the Libertarian Party issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition. In fact the LP has promised in its platform since 1977 for at least 16 years to abolish both agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped to write that plank. True the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and Big Lies the LP is right about what happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977 Waco never would have happened. Think about it. And think about the fact that if you've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights let alone human life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty maybe the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

"2","NO SURRENDER! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver April 18 1993 It is a fact of modern life that urban residents particularly women feel threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are immediate threats the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The stranger at the door. The abusive husband finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The mugger...the rapist. And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort learn martial arts. and always there's the implied question what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you? But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10 years to devote learning judo? What if after examining the facts a woman learns that rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured(Kleck124) than those using any other form of resistance (Kleck126) (also true for robbery/assault)(Kleck123) What if to our horror and despair we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed. In truth the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual only the whole community. As a society are we going to ask women once again to sacrifice themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves? Here's a thought. Neil Smith in his book The Probability Broach says no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out. But if a woman decides to protect herself with the easiest most efficient means possible people - especially other women - are horrified. Eughh how could you? I'd be terrified! they ask. How could you hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from you. In truth 1% of defensive gun uses result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim.(122Kleck) Well despite the lies and the social pressure some of us have already made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers burglars or rapists. We're buying more guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching others women and men how to use them. Most importantly we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense. We're taking our own security literally into our own hands. We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. But there's another threat more insatiable than any mugger more secretive than any burglar more soul-destroying than any rapist. That menace is government and it threatens us all. We know that governments throughout time have suppressed rights and oppressed people. It's the way they survive. In our names and with our money it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad. It lies to us cheats us steals from us and threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides it's for your own safety or we know best. Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender. But this monster called government persists and grows. And we who should be its masters have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt me? Then why did you file your income tax? Like any reasonable person I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after you. And make no mistake they're after you and they're after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds Groff Metzenbahm Moynihan and Clinton. If we're lucky they'll settle for our assault rifles our shotguns our handguns and our ammunition. As citizens we have only two choices. They are the same two choices given to women: to surrender or to fight. Surrender leads to the gulag to the genocide of Pol Pot to the disappearances to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if they have to they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson: the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots. As a patriot I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest and write and speak and teach our children justice honor and truth. And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it can lead to Tiananmen Square. When the time comes to stand up if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick. My opinions are of course my own."

If I remember correctly (please correct me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an off position or an on position because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?

"2","In the wake of the Waco denouement I had email discussions with people from this group.  In particular we discussed how cults operate why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations. I include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my correspondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain the information content. Ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the comments in parentheses are new intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand. These notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize. Cheers(?) Oded ------------------------ (begin included text) ----------------------- I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS ...  The course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external reading too). William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of evil mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY University of Chicago Press 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII and by extension in other wars in racial lynchings ...  I don't think the books are perfect and the study of psychopathology has advanced ... but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I think they're onto something. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How cult psychology works... [I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.] So long as Koresh could own his people he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them away from him. Otherwise he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege ex-Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls. Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they believed him they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all if they ever left him God would catapult them straight to Hell and the combined forces of the US gummint with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful) couldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it I'd stay and die too like the folks in Jonestown. For a prosaic analogy replace a cult leader with an estranged wife (or husband) and notice how many folks show up kill the ex and then themselves.  That's the consequence of shattered cultism.  It really does happen all the time.  [By the way the treasured ideal in such cases without which life is meaningless is the relationship no matter how abusive rather than the individual's partner.] ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Why No News Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?] I agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good (?)  reasons for news blackouts. >	The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted >	yesterday those people would be alive today. ... that no matter what those people would have died because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence. Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He held them hostage as his trump against going to jail but nothing would really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away! Look at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once Jonestown was discovered and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves because Jim Jones knew he'd be busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children brought up by some of the women in the cult were shouted down.  There are tapes...  The logic of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is it wouldn't kill the kids was shouted down as blasphemy and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the same with the Branch Davidians. (There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr. titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.) ... The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ... So the only way the BATF/FBI could save those people and future cults is by ignoring such signs. I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go or somehow influencing his people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. ... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts noise and other sensory insults.  However maybe they're not very sophisticated or maybe the job is impossible.  It's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk. ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after] ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from Koresh they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed. ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them or well-meaning boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face especially if at checkmate time people really die and I could be blamed. ... I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy unless you deny the FBI BATF Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all. (the end) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay have at it."

"2","Relay of coverage seen: ---------------------- There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!) The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines. It was also emphasized that the survey of the crime scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere. The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case. That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow. My opinions: ----------- I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize. Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me. It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous months. Please also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility IMHO.  As such my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available. Scott Roby                                                Standard Disclaimer --"

But to think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez and that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton etc. is naive.  These agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have ultimate accountability to the Prez they make their own moves and then tell the Prez who says I knew all along.  While this may not seem right or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command leading to the White House thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not after all composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis have lunch and maybe golf together.  I do agree the FBI BATF messed up. I'm not sure if they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way Jehova Witnesses are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave. Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist although I do not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is digging the divisiveness closemindedness and right-wing morons that are associated with the religion.  Anyway the Messiah that I was taught about would not be carrying a gun let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt BATF reports all you want David Koresh was not a poor soul who was unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side I do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said are true.  Anyway this is just another excuse to try and blame President Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from reaching its full potential."

It then would have been very clear exactly who was at fault then rather than the way it turned out. AND that would have been the WORST case.  The best would have been they finally get hungry and come out.  Possible/likely?

"2","Editorial - A10 Saturday April 24 1993 CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the same column) we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re- moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's new CrimeStrike project engineered by Arizona's former chief assist- ant attorney general Steven J. Twist. CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement. Phoenix will be the home for this national organization. The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun control and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek reasonable regulation of firearms. But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation a response to a clear need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac- countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals. When an organization has an issue it has an issue and Crime- Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars to getting criminals off the street. We say welcome to town."

"2","Okay here is the result of my efforts.  I'm just getting started with this type of activity so please set your flame-thowers on low. Comments corrections suggestions welcomed. **************************************************************************** Editor I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to the right to keep and bear arms and to a greater degree the many other rights that we take for granted on a daily basis. 1.	You're sleeping at night when you hear someone in your house.  You call the police.  How will you defend yourself should the need arise while you are waiting for the police to arive? 2.	You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A good samaritan stops to help when you find you and your family at gun-point or knife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? 3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears suddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you strong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape you in order to survive the attack? If the House and Senate have their way we will soon not have the right to keep and bear arms as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation but are you going to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to defend yourself and your family? Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If certain members of the House and Senate have their way .25 .32 and 9mm ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law enforcement departments.  Very soon you may not be able to purchase ammunition for use in your handgun. There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened? Our local police do an excellent job but they can not be there all the time or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while waiting for help to arrive. There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit the sale of certain types of ammuntion handguns rifles and shot-guns.  One elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected officials decided that they should only belong to a certain church or go to church on a partiular day?  What if you were told that you could only read certain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the right to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful manner? These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments. If we give up one right we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight for the right to keep and bear arms what will you fight for?  When your life is affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by defending your Second Amendment rights."

And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors blow with a steam explosion but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See what a can of worms this is?  Last I heard Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the PRISM design there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is flawed in a few respects already. >  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses >in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause >death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of >people if released in a city similarly populated area resevoir or >cropland. Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If you don't mind extrapolation any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus.  Finally that manure pile I mention below fits this definition as does say releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild. >Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous >gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there >is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for >research purposes on such chemicals. And I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can be used for welding in miners lamps for gassing gophers or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that it can also be a weapon just like any other flammable substance. So now my miners lamps won't work I can't do any welding and I still have those pesky gophers. >I am not a lawyer but these ideas could certainly be a basis for >definitions. The basis for but I'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good. >>I'll give >>you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the >>road?

Many things are >banned for other reasons. It meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that can be used for fighting even though that is not its intended purpose and despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water mass destruction is rather a given. It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not see a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another.  The looser your definition the more ripe for abuse that law is.  Furthermore if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law.  Again ripe for abuse. < Dan Sorenson DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > <  ISU only censors what I read not what I say.

For those of you still unsure whether this is satire the jury is still out: Also yesterday even though the compound no longer exists the US attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents including a search warrant and related affidavits that authorities planned to use when the siege was over. These documents did not include the original warrants the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms had in late February which to this day have never been released. ...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek samples of Koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had signed for some gun purchases but also that he espoused 'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly the ATF.'

"2","This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list: I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.)  So yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said... Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before) he would not discuss that but would concentrate on the original raid. Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This isn't the first time that the leader of a new small religious group has been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies maybe especially to people like Koresh. Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US. There were none until about 1830 when they began in metropolitan areas. Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress they called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many small police departments jealous of one another and competitive but not large enough to be a threat to liberty hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the FBI was started agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they were to be after all a bureau of investigation not a police force). All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power. The BATF started as a tax collection agency whose primary job was to raid illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable many illegal stills disappeared and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its existence so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review the media is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place where at a pre-arranged time a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork but if any irregularities are found the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises and the luckless FFL in chains. The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for review. Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad and that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover for example) and would have had some medical personnel on hand. He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais ok come pick me up and the sheriff did temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested.  Koresh was later cleared release and presumably got his guns back.  At least at that time he was rational enough to be approached rationally and behaved in a reasonable manner. The BATF didn't take into account that unlike most of the FFL's they audit Koresh was actually paranoid and fostered paranoia in his followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them and they reacted accordingly. With respect to the original warrant it had not been unsealed when Kates was giving his talk so he could not comment on it except to mention that the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had more to say about the way the warrant was served which may have been completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet there may have been no justification for the BATF breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant or by an improperly served warrant then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so this was the first shot fired! The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial position on the side of the BATF the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy. Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous diverse inefficient decentralized etc.  Better a few inept accidents like this than a move toward a single large well-organized well-trained powerful domestic police force which would eventually have even more tragic results. - Lyn Bates (bates@bbn.com) PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston College Law School next Tuesday April 27.  I don't know the exact time or place but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that information. -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false. Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges. They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID impound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED. Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters not federal.  The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process. So maybe the best way for BATF/FBI to save people is to mind their own fucking business. -- cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet..."

This includes what the government says that two survivors have said. 2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says including what he says that most of the survivors have said. Strange but they seem to disagree in most important particulars. If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors speaking first-hand feel free ot pitch in.  I may have missed it.

First unless that round is chambered there is little threat of penetration by the bullet or the brass for that matter.  Unless that expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice pop and not enough threat for even firefighters to worry about.

They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells. Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides the ranch house (not fort apocalypse; it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The Gun loonies couldn't hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames. The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well* under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that the FBI ATF Attorney General Janet Reno and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve. Someone should pay for this needless tragic waste of human life. Sadly these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still the American people will probably believe them. > Next question. > > > The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters > to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place. This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns *and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On the other hand if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound. But the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn't been proven yet so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children but if this is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified. The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms tobacco and alcohol violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction.  Better yet they should be s**tcanned IMO. > The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to > attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had > had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type > raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults. Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are heavily-armed religious wackos. David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud. > It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity > to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead > he ordered the murder of the children. Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this. Therefore if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true the FBI and ATF still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die. > In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive > the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the > suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

The ATF's initial claim---which they later retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous. > The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely.

Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.

"2","Freed om of Religion has absolutely nothing to do with building a small arsenal and grooming 10-year old children to be your wife. I'll come out as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals. Oh OK David. I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because he grew up inside the cult and engaged in a power struggle where his supporters helped inflate his ego. That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and twisting their impressionable little minds. This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously. There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I expected this to happen. Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower to die. Fuck all of you Big Brother paranoid freaks.

If we are indeed talking about CS then this is not quite accurate. CS is just tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas and doesn't have direct CNS effects. However it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968 8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water but attacked my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful and my entire face felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after exposure and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours I doubt whether I could find the exit.

What I saw was an unnecessary unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th. Probably even an illegal action by ATF certainly way out of proportion to anything reasonable. And yet according to a pole taken yesterday 95% of the people poled believe the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack. I suppose they also believed things like: I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget. We don`t need to lead with a tax increase.... It starts with a middle-class tax cut... I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history. I will ask congress for a line item veto.. I will lift the social security earnings test.. I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves right rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than 50% chance of being right about my first guess! Read the constitution sometime it is supposed to protect the citizens and their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power.

If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. The CPHV reports that 135000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that 400000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged latch-key children (kids who come home from school to an empty house) have access to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 and a 40% increase between 1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the statistics. >>thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah (Got news >>for you folks if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours >>presently he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they >>were in danger). > >Holding kids?

I meant that to put children in a situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the act of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over these children directly but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is would not let innocent children die. If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive?

Yes its a horrible way to go but apparently not so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to carry it through.

No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies you mention and since Koresh apparently has a different view point from your Baptist upbringing then he is not worthy of protection from religious persecution.

The idea of 'sorting it out in court later' is fine but one has to GET TO COURT IN ONE PIECE to do that.  Korash had good reason to think that he was not going to get that chance.

He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off he saw he was being ATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh its ok its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at that point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear of his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have you ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think under that pressure when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate what is going on?  And it would not be the first time that 'law enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For all we know he was informed by someone saying something like Hey guy the BATF is coming like gangbusters and they mean to WASTE you... According to the latest news the released warrant (so we are told) said the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around $200000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period). Now even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a drug siezure for 90 people that isn't really all that much (you priced decent guns lately?).  Hell I can think of a person right now that probably has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL mostly machineguns!!!  Sure he is an avid collector but unless a new law has been passed it is NOT illegal nor an indication of anything illegal to have a lot of guns.  Also note that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So what is the justification of this cowboy raid other than a romp gone bad for some anti-gun media hype to support Clinton's push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons? This administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL. Whether it is gun control Clinton Cripple Chip National smart ID cards it all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.

And BATF knew the BDs were expecting them (via 60 minutes report).  But they decided they were so big so bad they would have a cakewalk at the BDs expense for a nice media show anyway.  But it all turned to shit and the FBI taking over to manage things we see it all turned to shit too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH. Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet you NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.

(This is also >covered in the above reference.) No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder. Two  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my reloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was about 100 lbs of smokeless powder 5 lbs of black powder several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds primarily in .45ACP .30-20 and .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the reloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2 of char on the joists subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other words. None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited. No explosion as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans the plastic lids melted completely away. Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the rifle ammo the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were found still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around. No dents were observed above the storage area indicating the bullets left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard. Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless of what the FBI says. John -- John De Armond WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

The third was to stay inside. Last time I checked amassing an arsenal and practicing any kind of religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights.  Guess it's OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing a bunch of religious nutcakes eh? Of all the idiots I run into in daily life Dan your type scare me the most.  You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief just as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad.  Worse you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong. David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again neither are the baptists methodists catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT even though Koresh's the Baptists the methodists etc don't believe the same way I do I recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment. You see I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned from it I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go my own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else either individually or collectively as the great socialist we has ANY RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong. You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound in order to save themselves.  Think (if you're capable) for a moment about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically designed to force you to make that forsake or die decision? The forsake or die option is exactly what the government forced on the Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51 when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men women and children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The people who stayed who held to their beliefs over personal safety whose individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit who believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says to those people go my deepest respect regardless of their religion.  People like you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with well they could have come out get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face were there not a network between us.

At the time of the shooting no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll away from the body of students.  Some students were taunting them and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting. The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill while occasionally their NCO .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. All at once as if on command the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters... they were only passing through and were not participants in the confrontation. There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president who had conveniently flown the coop so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio James Rhodes had just embarked on a senate campaign and wanted it to be known that he was tough on peaceniks so had ordered the guard in. The matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later wounded survivors launched a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made and under the terms the plaintiffs could not discuss much and guilty individuals were not identified (in fact those shooters in the squad have been identified). It was a tragic incident but it was not provoked by the students or apparently by General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the photos IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers."

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that David Koresh had explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 feet into the air.  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the first place.  For example when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So why didn't they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying.  Hopefully the truth will come out. Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this so-called explosion resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited. We figure that this is what it was because of how the explosion looked and sounded.  Obviously it wasn't due to something like TNT dynamite or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day. Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs.  Earlier when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS. What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the compound.  As a matter of fact Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades rockets or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others find what they want for them to find if you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades. Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

"2","Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ? BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas no propaganda value there. The FBI screwed-up big time all the time. They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault before the BDs could decide on a strategy would have been the better plan. The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF and if they mistook their identity initially they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the BDs had a problem with the warrants they take it to court just like the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons they could have obtained the proper permits just like the rest of us would need to do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth. If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to vote on laws and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos' the general public didn't seem to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is raiding militant black organizations we don't mind the heavy hand. When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads the public doesn't mind. Suddenly when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies we get all bent out of shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow. Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious fanaticism militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't blame it on 'them' the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'. -- Jim Mason"

What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at first then they should have surrendered immediately when they did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal wants are not backed by the majority of voters then too bad. If they wanted to keep automatic weapons then they could apply for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction within their borders. You live on US territory you live by US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman) Sure the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco. The BATF threatened with budget cuts was trying for a propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the other hand they DID have the legal right to do what they did. Once the attack was begun they should have pressed on and finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that take root. The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again the laws we voters have approved or the lawmakers who created them gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and the FBI are latter-day Gestapo it is because the voters have allowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana - militarist mentality religious fanaticism and unadulterated violence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay for or vote for and this was the result of many choices we have made over the years. Don't blame 'them' - blame ourselves. We made 'them' we ARE 'them'."

I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are running around in circles trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some- times. Jason - u28037@uicvm.cc.uic.edu"

"2","------------------------- Original Article ------------------------- The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article on Paxton Quigley including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph and surprise surprise surprise they published it.  The text follows. The Colorado Daily btw is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup but every little bit i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) Gun Stats The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley author of Armed and Female.  The article in turn cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The article states A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder.  This is an often-quoted statistic and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons outlined below: The study gives the impression that if you own a gun the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you.  The study however fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork every month the second your grandmother cashes her social security check.  Possibly an acquaintance but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample size (396) taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used successfully by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder and will (unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity. In fact it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye you were reasonably safe. Thus the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds. -- Alane -- /-----------------------------------------------------------------\ /   NOBODY shares my opinions    |    I am a jelly doughnut      \ /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\"

Sounds a bit >>tacky but hey whatever works. As David Veal points out this sort of promotion would be used against gun owners by the mass media. However here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area free as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40 or $50 so offering it free is a good promotion. Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished teaching another one last night in fact) and they have been very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun but feel they should know something about gun safety since members of their family keep guns at home. Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits: (1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats. (2) A gun safety class is Politically Correct and likely to be viewed positively by the public and the media. (3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts) and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a gentle introduction to firearms. (4) Some of the students are enthusiastic and will purchase a gun and become more involved in shooting or personal defense. (5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable non-aggressive soft-spoken people which helps to mitigate the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun students sometimes tell us they have something new to think about with regards to personal gun ownership. (6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. Our course is the standard NRA-certified Home Firearm Safety class and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also teach the NRA's Personal Protection class although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs. -- Alane -- /-----------------------------------------------------------------\ /   NOBODY shares my opinions    |    I am a jelly doughnut      \ /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\"

No because we have decided that it doesn't make enough difference to us to get up and do something.  That's something for instance a lot of people who go speak against gun control bills at their local government.  Dozens of pro-gun speakers show up and few if any antis do but  they often win anyway.

Now IF you would like to reduce the number how would you do it without affecting good/responcible gun owners ?? I DO believe in a persons freedom. What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it. MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals and that you HAVE to give 'a little' to make that society work. Cars and guns should really not be mixed I just tried to make a point. Like America Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b so a car is essential in most parts.... Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway so we don't argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars..... EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY! Is this discussion about 1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans or 2.

I still think there are 'some' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy or make a new newsgroup. (If you read the first postings after the Waco fire you should see who I mean......)

But clearly It was a no-knock according to the Associated Press report. Here's something I found in my collection: Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final Edition Monday March 1 1993 (the byline is associated press): WACO Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100 law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members were reported killed.  [...] The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and explosives and to arrest Howell said Les Stanford of the ATF in Washington.  [...] Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home throwing concussion grenades and screaming Come out while three ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment there was no response.  Then the shooting began. I think storming the sect's head-quaters and throwing concussion grenades qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault). > he was not just another guy minding his own business.

"2","I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization which claims to be championing conservative issues esp. in the wake of the Republican defeat last fall. Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run. You'd be close to the truth. Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett former 'Drug Czar' who heartily supported Bush's semi-auto import ban and wondered if it went far enough - who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and Jack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. These are conservatives ? Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect's spell check against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'Bennett' : 1. Banned 2.

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to convert the souls of deceased persons of other religions in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking and the story was quite detailed).

And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A fairly simple problem given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We all believe criminals particularly violent criminals should not have firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to do it and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus we are left with a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting the many?  We say no while others say yes. >Now IF you would like to reduce the number how would you do it without >affecting good/responcible gun owners ?? Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it. >I DO believe in a persons freedom. >What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it. Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention is how much one has to pay. >MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals and that you HAVE >to give 'a little' to make that society work. It is this giving a little that makes Americans wary... We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a Chamberlain gave a little to a particular fascist/short asshole and how such appeasement worked.  While it might work in some instances it doesn't work in others and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure. >Cars and guns should really not be mixed I just tried to make a point. >Like America Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b >so a car is essential in most parts.... >Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway so we don't >argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars..... Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus cars are not essential for your transportation.  However the arguments presented show that since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns.  How one defines essential often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we look at the raw data such comparisons are not individually weighed. >EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were >more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY! This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As Desert Storm proved even an armed populace won't just revolt even when given a chance.  Still would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace?  We have to wonder as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace. Thus we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony. One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action. >Is this discussion about >1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans >            or >2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ?? It is about #2 but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have wound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that or was so logical. >Change of name....... That was on my part purely in jest.

Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ?? If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have guns) what do you think will happen ??

A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths and not attempt to affect childhood falls drownings gunshot injuries etc.???????????????? So this so called rational person (using your definition) if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease injuries stroke suicide liver disease chronic lung disease homicide HIV infection or diabetes.

Either you have a very limited imagination or a strange definition of the word valid. Here are a few reasons you might want a gun *right now*: You're a Korean greengrocer in LA and a riot has just started in a nearby neighborhood. You've received a death threat. Your SO has just broken your arm and you fear for your life if you stay with him and he's said he'll kill you if you leave him. A psychopath is breaking into people's houses in your neighborhood and robbing and killing people inside. A violent mugger is operating on the route you have to take to get to your night job. There are lots of dangers you might be in that won't wait for the waiting period for you to purchase a gun. -- Pro-Choice                 Anti-Roe                     - E.

It provides for licensing citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction course (30 hours if I remember correctly) pay a $140 fee (good for 4 years) and meet several other criteria related to personal character etc. While I don't agree with all of the criteria I feel it's high time that pro-gun types fight the same way HCI et al. do -- by getting incremental changes in the law.

I heard it was delivered in high concentration to counteract the wind at 30 mph blowing it away.  What is your source for the quoted low concentration?"
