X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab space newline) and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces though it is not a X    requirement.  Also if possible try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested but not required that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something put it in the ---remark--- section or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files use multiple X	  ---info--- sections one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title followed by an optional X	       digit followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title possibly followed X       by a digit followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed. X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid setgid super-user X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal education or non-profit use is Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel. X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests.  In certain X    cases a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand given X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry.  And sometimes X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C such as K&R C you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[string];   <--- use string[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h> use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define #if #ifdef ...) X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#' many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason we look for X    programs that are compact and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point) because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program we tend to favor the second version.  Of course a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a libXaw.a libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif Xv*ew or OpenL*ok toolkits since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier) so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases X	where this program differs from the contest rules the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient however X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6 pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X    and/or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub-directory say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something put it in the X    ---remark--- section or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u +%a %h %d %T 19%y X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files and shred all related paper.  By tradition we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s) if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary. X X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X    by a similar but slightly better entry.  For this reason it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes of course X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not we select a small entry (usually one line) a X    strange/creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (The New Hackers Dictionary) and on T-Shirts. X X    Last but not least winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

Xt Glossary ---------------------------------------------------------------------- o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object RectObj Core Composite Constraint Shell OverrideShell WMShell etc.  The terms Xt and Intrinsics are used interchangeably however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X window system.  In particular it does not include the Athena Motif OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the Intrinsics are not especially useful. o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The precise use is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the Object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets. o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib functions because Xt provides most such services although an understanding of Xlib helps with problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In brief Xlib Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up. Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used. How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information. /* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */ #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h> typedef struct { Visual	*visual; int	depth; } OptionsRec; OptionsRec	Options; XtResource resources[] = { {visual Visual XtRVisual sizeof (Visual *) XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec visual) XtRImmediate NULL} {depth Depth XtRInt sizeof (int) XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec depth) XtRImmediate NULL} }; XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { {-visual *visual XrmoptionSepArg NULL} {-depth *depth XrmoptionSepArg NULL} }; int main (argc argv) int		argc; char		**argv; { XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ Display		*dpy;		/* display */ char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ Arg		args[10]; Cardinal	cnt; char		*name = test; char		*class = Test; /* * save the command line arguments */ xargc = argc; xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); bcopy ((char *) argv (char *) xargv argc * sizeof (char *)); /* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. */ cnt = 0; top = XtAppInitialize (&app class Desc XtNumber (Desc) &argc argv (String *) NULL args cnt); dpy = XtDisplay (top); cnt = 0; XtGetApplicationResources (top &Options resources XtNumber (resources) args cnt); cnt = 0; if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) { XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNvisual Options.visual); ++cnt; /* * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could * use a default colormap based on the class of the * visual; we could examine some property on the * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could * do all sorts of things... */ colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)) Options.visual AllocNone); XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNcolormap colormap); ++cnt; /* * Now find some information about the visual. */ vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy VisualIDMask &vinfo &count); if (vinfo_list && count > 0) { XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNdepth vinfo_list[0].depth); ++cnt; XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); } } XtDestroyWidget (top); /* * Now create the real toplevel widget. */ XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNargv xargv); ++cnt; XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNargc xargc); ++cnt; top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL class applicationShellWidgetClass dpy args cnt); /* * Display the application and loop handling all events. */ XtRealizeWidget (top); XtAppMainLoop (app); return (0); } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such). Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome. As an example on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome 256 entry colormap static gray static color and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor 24 bit TrueColor an Overlay Plane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell. A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen() DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree. If the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See section 2.8 of the Xt specification. It eventually does get destroyed just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have completed before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d among other things. As some further caveats/trivia the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used such as calling exit() directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets temporary files allocated X resources etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget): Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget		top; for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); } void ExitCallback (gw closure call_data) Widget		gw;		/* widget */ XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ { Widget		toplevel; toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); exit (0); } One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur. This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks. One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain practices. Try the following code instead. #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> extern Widget ToplevelGet ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget		gw #endif ); extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes XtPointer	closure #endif ); extern void ExitCallback ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget		gw XtPointer	closure XtPointer	call_data #endif ); Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget		top; for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); } void ExitCallback (gw closure call_data) Widget		gw;		/* widget */ XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ { Widget		toplevel; toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw) ExitWorkProc (XtPointer) NULL); } Boolean ExitWorkProc (closure) XtPointer	closure; { exit (0); /*NOTREACHED*/ } ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- After it is realized one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize. To change the position of a Shell use XtSetValues() on the Shell not the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It does however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call. How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is tail -f filename. It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular: - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while (several thousand times) and then stop until some other event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this. - Pyramid doesn't work at all. - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets) wasn't completely broken but although the writing side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks (get raound it by detecting the situation and having select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had been given the whole block). Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read() file descriptor pipes etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete which means its a 1000 pages.

What Widgets are available? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are three popular widget sets: Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently a 3d look is available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think it is poorly implemented. OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality. I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get. In addition the following collection of widgets are also available: Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph stacked bar graph line graph pie chart xy plot hypertext help spreadsheet and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen them so I can't comment. FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor FileDialog and a few others.  The current set of widgets can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so widely used. Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. Again a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/* The following specialized widgets are also available: Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).

What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- __________________________________________ Name		Language	Vendor __________________________________________ Xview		C		Sun OI		C++		ParcPlace Interviews	C++		Stanford Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu __________________________________________ However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) typdef struct { String	name; long	value; } Arg; and the code: Arg	arg; XtSetArg (arg name 3.2) expands to Arg	arg; arg.name = name; arg.value = 3.2; you can see that with normal C type conversions the arg.value gets the integer 3 instead of the floating point value 3.2.  When the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So how to get around this? The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions. #define XtSetFloatArg(arg n d) \ if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \ XtSetArg(arg n &(d)); \ } else { \ XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \ XtSetArg(arg n *ld); \ } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com): The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values. There are several main types of resource converters: string to data type data type to string data type to data type i) string to data type Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values: Name		Value True		1 False		0 In this case the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values. If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many converters each with a small number of enumeration strings) then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks.  That way the first time one of these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters. ii) data type to string This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead the data type value is simply converted to a string value probably by the use of sprintf. Data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms. If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent. iii) data type to data type This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type.  For instance an X pixel value can be converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for red green and blue. The type signature for a resource converter is as follows: typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display * XrmValuePtr Cardinal * XrmValuePtr XrmValuePtr XtPointer *); Display *dpy; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; XrmValuePtr fromVal; XrmValuePtr toVal; XtPointer *converter_data; When the converter is invoked the fromVal argument points to the source X resource manager value and the toVal argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The converter_data argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The args and num_args arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel. Care must be taken with the toVal argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value: typedef struct { unsigned int    size; caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue *XrmValuePtr; When the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True. If the location is NULL then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True. When writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro: #define DONE(var type) \ if (toVal->addr) \ { \ if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return False; \ } \ else \ *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return True; #define DONESTR(str) \ if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return False; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return True; Inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the num_args and args arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly. Once you have written your converter you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database. To register a converter with a single application context use XtAppSetTypeConverter: void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context from to converter args num_args cache destructor) XtAppContext context; String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor; To register a converter with all application contexts use XtSetTypeConverter: void XtSetTypeConverter(from to converter args num_args cache destructor) String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor; In the R3 Intrinsics there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible the newer routines should be used. When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics a cache argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached: XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions). The destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition: typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext XrmValuePtr XtPointer XrmValuePtr Cardinal *); XtAppContext context; XrmValuePtr to; XtPointer converter_data; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the to argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered. Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution: mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See Multi-user Application Software Using Xt The X Resource Issue 3 (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context. The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways: 1. User selects a quit button on one of the displays 2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message 3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message server shutdown/crash or network failure. I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not then read the Oliver Jones article. The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem. The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this: #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover; void XIOHandler (dpy) Display		*dpy; { destroyDisplay (dpy); longjmp (XIOrecover 1); } main () { ... if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); XtAppMainLoop (app_context); } The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay(). For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate. Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor BadAtom or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display. There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First the general changes for each release are described.  Then a certainly incomplete list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority): 1. Args passed at creation time. 2. Command line arguments. 3. User's per host defaults file 4. User's defaults file. 5. User's per application default file. 6. System wide per application default file. Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries. The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used. The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically the program xrdb is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not. A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following 6/92] You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): %N	The value of the filename parameter or the application's class name. %T	The value of the file type.  In this case the literal string app-defaults %C	customization resource (R5 only) %S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L	Language locale and codeset (e.g. ja_JP.EUC) %l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ja) %t	The territory part of the display's language string %c	The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is Myterm. Also suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11 then in /usr/openwin. Let's consider another example. This time let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly. NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless. With R5 there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example you might run the myterm application like this: myterm -xrm *customization: -color If one of your pathname specifications had the value /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C then the expanded pathname would be /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is <root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%N%C:\     (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N: <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to . a single dot.  In R3 all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ./ a dot followed by a slash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92) The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution. The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list. Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says: callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended. you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92) > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However if my window is iconified the flag > stays set to TRUE. Right everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a deficiency in the X protocol and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The deficiency is that the information is available in one way in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2 so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification. A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual. > Is this a problem with mwm or is there something > else which needs to be done? You'll see this with any window manager with no window manager. > If the problem is mwm what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified? As an application writer keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can't. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc XtFree etc? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately most code that calls malloc() realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like: ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) if (!ptr) { perror (malloc in xyzzy()); exit (1) } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc() XtCalloc() XtNew() XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc() calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits. In addition if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like: if (!ptr) ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); else ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); ++count; to be written as: ptr = XtRealloc (ptr sizeof (ptr) * ++count); Also XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors. XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string: struct abc *xyzzy; char	     *ptr; char	     *str = abcdef; xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ ptr = XtNewString (str); A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as: char	      *ptr; ptr = XtMalloc (100); /* ... */ free (ptr); may not work.  Personally I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor. A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree(). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First I'd recomend getting purify from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info). Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers.  These instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors such as reading unitialized memory writing past malloc'd bounds or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program including third party and vendor object-code libraries and verifies system call interfaces.  In addition Purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five. An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun) runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is The SENTINEL Debugging Environment.  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info) Next if you are getting any sort of Xlib error you'll need to run in synchronous mode easily accomplished with the -sync command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous. Next if you are having trouble with window layout you can use the undocumented resource xtIdentifyWindows or the class resource XtDebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example: example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' & example% xwininfo -tree <click in new xload window> will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets. Next if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea. The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped. The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine and running the application on the other possibly using a command sequence like this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0; thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger. or this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% gdb application (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 (gdb) run ... I believe CodeCenter a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints. Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput() XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly. I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect but in my real application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3 R4 and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts you won't get those events. For example: ... cnt = 0; toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app class Desc XtNumber (Desc) &argc argv Fallback args cnt); XtAddTimeOut (...) XtAddWorkProc (...) XtAppMainLoop (app) would never invoke the timeout. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93) Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients in an ``intuitive'' fashion. Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other and so far as I know they are not published. I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a standard drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt). The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions for more details read the code. I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway. The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib. -- Pete Ware					ware@cis.ohio-state.edu CIS Dept Ohio State University			w/ (614) 292-7318 228 Bolz Hall 2036 Neil Ave.			h/ (614) 538-0965 Columbus OH 43210"

"1","Hi I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine and I'm observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a DrawingArea. Namely some Xlib operations work and some do not. In particular the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some XDrawPoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction. Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug? Thanks Zack T. Smith"

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests.  In certain X    cases a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand given X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry.  And sometimes X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C such as K&R C you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      | X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[string];   <--- use string[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h> use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define #if #ifdef ...) X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#' many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason we look for X    programs that are compact and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point) because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program we tend to favor the second version.  Of course a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a libXaw.a libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif Xv*ew or OpenL*ok toolkits since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier) so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases X	where this program differs from the contest rules the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient however X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6 pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X    and/or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub-directory say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something put it in the X    ---remark--- section or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u +%a %h %d %T 19%y X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files and shred all related paper.  By tradition we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s) if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary. X X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X    by a similar but slightly better entry.  For this reason it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes of course X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not we select a small entry (usually one line) a X    strange/creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (The New Hackers Dictionary) and on T-Shirts.

X X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984 this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see The New Hacker's Dictionary by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets perhaps even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus? XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network type graph with automatic layout capability.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X due out last February :-) has full support for C++. I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated a variety of other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different ways and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop internationalization etc.).

This can be a chicken and egg sort of problem however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ there is an example that should show how it can be done.

Please reply via e-mail. They aren't functions they are character arrays. The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it undefined so simply recompile one or the other.

"1","I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is run more than once on a display the tones are buffered in the X server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this e.g. by emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits? - Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the JET project."

The ability to program was >an entry requirement. At Robert Gordon University programming was the main (most time-consuming) start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX) Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler) Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog) Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors). The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2) Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler) Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this? BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README: This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates Wc - Widget Creation resource files and this distribution also includes the Widget Creation Library (version 1.06 with the exception of the demos and Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README dirt.A2.0.tar.Z and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175). Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool. Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components for which it generates C/UIL code.

This FAQ includes information on a number of gotchas that can bite you on particular system. However the best source of general information on building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled separately from the rest of the release so if it's become separated from your sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[msPSTXT] at the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the xstuff mail server. In addition O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5? Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym etc.? If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined link with libdl.a.  Add -ldl to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to surround it with -Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable since syslibs get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile the stubs shared.) [thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM) 12/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2? In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling -Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic appears to work. To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt) please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: Patch i.d.      Description 100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu [Greg Earle earle@Sun.COM; 7/92] A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93] contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution but I get several segmentation faults when running X. Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms. Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or return structs run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and the server. This is from the GCC manual: On the Sparc GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference. This really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in GNU CC so it isn't straightforward to fix it. The convention for structure returning is also incompatible and `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help. You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags. Files which need to be compiled using cc include: server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c rgb/rgb.c In addition several of the inet_ functions use structs as args or return values: clients/xhost/xhost.c clients/xauth/gethost.c. Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. Fatal server bug! no screens found. Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do this simple test: #include <sys/ioctl.h> SIOCGIFCONF Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i' your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are identical try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files. [courtesy der Mouse mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3? In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c we have found missing defines for CG3AC_MONOLEN CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_ENBLEN CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be? The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile: #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024) #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN However the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device and so references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the Imakefile.  [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found. Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied from another distribution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results: ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even: ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun remember that you need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server run it on the server's clients too).  While building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation. If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib /usr/local/lib or /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined) This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface). A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against. [10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis (jpf@heliocentric.com)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole? There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries; to avoid the problem do one of these: 1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site. 2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). 3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries. [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler) 12/90] The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole? On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console display. Check the man page for fbtab(5). [Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 106)  What is Imake? Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not specific to X the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. Imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files system-independent configuration files and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious. There have been several different versions of imake; the R3 R4 and R5 versions are different. You can obtain information on imake from these sources: - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information - on the R4 tapes contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake. - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of send imake-stuff help to almanac@primate.wisc.edu. - see System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe? by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert. - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article Das Meta-Make / I make you make / Schwerelos by Rainer Klute in iX Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal issue 2:1. - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake. - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z. [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake? Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such configuration files although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5. export contains the R5 distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. A stand-alone version of Imake but one stemming from X11R5 is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do? If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system run xmkmf. This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make which will use that new Makefile to compile the program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs I get the following link error: Undefined: _XShapeQueryExtension _XShapeCombineMask These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers as well as many vendor-supplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway. In order to use the shape extension you must link to the library libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files do not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries. [from John B. Melby melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net 3/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with _XtInherit not found on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit. What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently you can't share a function that is both called and compared as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is in Initialize.c where XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called. You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed just linked in. 2) alternatively your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView program. In this case you can remove -lXt from your link command. It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the problem. [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under the current version of X I get this message: Undefined: _XtScrollBarSetThumb _XtTextSetInsertionPoint _XtTextReplace There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)? The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this you must set up what are called hints for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based you can use something like the following: XWMHints wmhints; ... wmhints.flags = InputHint; wmhints.input = True; XSetWMHints(dpy window &wmhints) If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics you can set the XtNinput resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'. Certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having this done. If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant. OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running? You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case. For most cases you shouldn't care which window manager is running so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available? There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. In X the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just this one little thing include contrib/clients/xskel a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions and the Xlib Hello World example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90] In addition a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)? The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this: { Arg args[3]; int i; int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */ i=0; XtSetArg (args[i] XtNsensitive &sensitive); i++; XtGetValues(widget args i ); ... } But XtNsensitive is a Boolean which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable sensitive as Boolean works properly. This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work? You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising functions XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest() are also for use only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted. [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx XtNy XtNwidth or XtNheight.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow? Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget. Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David B.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. In general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget? XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt? It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a yes answer the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(Widget w XtPointer client XtPointer call) { int             answer; answer = AskUser(w Really Quit?); if (RET_YES == answer) { answer = AskUser(w Are You Really Positive?); if (RET_YES == answer) exit(0); } } A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for OK Cancel and Help or equivalents: int AskUser(w string) Widget          w; char           *string; { int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */ Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry but ...*/ Arg             args[3]; int             n = 0; XtAppContext    context; n=0; XtSetArg(args[n] XmNmessageString XmStringCreateLtoR(string XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++; XtSetArg(args[n] XmNdialogStyle XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w) string args n); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNokCallback response &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNcancelCallback response &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNhelpCallback response &answer); XtManageChild(dialog); context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w); while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) { XtAppProcessEvent (context XtIMAll); } XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } The dialog supports three buttons which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w client call) Widget          w; XtPointer client; XtPointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case XmCR_OK: *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */ break; case XmCR_CANCEL: *answer = RET_NO; break; case XmCR_HELP: *answer = RET_HELP; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is. Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects. If you are still using R3 you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt including R4. #include <X11/CoreP.h> #include <X11/Xresource.h> String XtName (widget) Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */ { return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); } [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program: > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...widgetClass...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...window...);	/* produces error */ The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (no window) could create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage? The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it you can take the following steps to avoid the error: 1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events the copy wasn't clean and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server: display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); if (display) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display by convention or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY if set]. This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a busy cursor while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application? The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute toplevel with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window): unsigned long valuemask; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask); attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel) XC_watch); /* The window will be as big as the display screen and clipped by its own parent window so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel) XtWindow(toplevel) 0 0 65535 65535 (unsigned int) 0 0 InputOnly CopyFromParent valuemask &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. When you want to use this busy cursor map and raise this window; to go back to normal unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. In addition note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then immediately in the child process close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. Alternatively before exec'ing make this call which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec.

No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing) it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.

You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler or more likely if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket pipe or file input? It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor. A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. Most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: if (ioctl(fd FIONREAD &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event. If you're sending events to your own application then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server. Depending on how well the widget was written you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want. [courtesy Mark A.

You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped: while (!done) { XNextEvent(the_display&the_event); switch (the_event.type) { case Expose:	 /* On expose events redraw */ XDrawLine(the_displaythe_windowthe_GC55100100); break; ... } } Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors so this program could previously include this code: ... the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_displaythe_screen);	/* e.g. */ the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_displaythe_screen);	/* e.g. */ the_GC = XCreateGC(the_displaythe_window GCForeground|GCBackground&the_GC_values); ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background. And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen? The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0 unix:0.1 unix:0.2 etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0 1 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection. The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. In Xt-based programs you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen. (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have Display in the names -- XDisplayWidth XDisplayHeight etc.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap set it to be the background pixmap of a window and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap) you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However this action alters the contents of the window and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent you have several choices: - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however not all servers support the extension. - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note that there is no X notion of a transparent color index. - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black for example should produce white. However the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] If you want to be combining colors with GXxor then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red say the result is blue and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red green and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using for example 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the standard colormap but it doesn't work. XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. Because X is asynchronous there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window. [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com) 4/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window? Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually the server assigns some bits the client others) and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource except for GCs and private color cells can be shared]. The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen.

[1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times? It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse) 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib? Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do client-side timeouts unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus you have to do timeouts which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the single-click action or the double-click action. [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse) 4/93] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text? Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. Your only choice if you want to stay within the core X protocol is to render the text into a pixmap read it back via XGetImage() rotate it by hand with whatever matrices you want and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically: 1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 4) for each xy in I2 I2(xy) = I(ab) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 5) render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript PEX PHiGS and GKS although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. In addition if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph. [courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) Eric Taylor (etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu) and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com) 11/90; Liam Quin (lee@sq.com) 12/90] InterViews (C++ UI toolkit in the X contrib software) has support for rendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code. [Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu) 3/91] Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests. [eric@pencom.com 10/91] The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font. The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. O'Reilly's X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 152)  What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?) There are places in the X Toolkit in applications and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names selection names selection targets resource types application classes and class extension record types; and several others. The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 tape; it is also available by sending send docs registry to the xstuff mail server. To register names (first come first served) or to ask questions send to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for confirmation.

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press.

Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels you name opaque are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea() and remember to adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin. The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask too. But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS... -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all not to be merged are 0. Then set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use GXCopy and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

The xpert mailing list is the general public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed so xpert is almost identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup. ***	If you get comp.windows.x you don't need to 	*** ***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		*** Otherwise you can join the list to receive X information electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort send mail to xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address. The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements such as new releases (including public patches from MIT) public reviews adoption of standards by the MIT X Consortium and conference announcements.  It does NOT carry advertisements source code patches or questions.  If you already receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing list you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise to subscribe send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself please contact your mail administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it. comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list. In addition the X Consortium sponsors these public lists: bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions x-ada           X and ada x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics ximage          people interested in image processing and X xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X To subscribe to one of these lists assuming no-one in your organization already receives it send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request addition request.

The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits. There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses? When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists be sure to include all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all. Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system give details of that too.  Give the machine type operating system and O/S version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager compiler and display hardware type you are using. Then tell exactly what you are doing exactly what happens and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails include the exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case please!) for readers to reproduce the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available? The trade magazines (Unix World Unix Review Computer Language etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include: - O'Reilly and Associates publishes The X Resource: A Practical Journal of the X Window System (103 Morris St. #A Sebastapol CA 95472). Editorial information: Adrian Nye adrian@ora.com. - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal Subscriber Services Dept XXX P.O. Box 3000 Denville NJ 07834 USA. Editorial information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms? Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An Xt-based program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets. Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets. Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source. Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors. Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++ but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3 as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5. CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib. XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host. XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources. RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning please locate and consult the relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual. UTSL: A common expression meaning take advantage of the fact that you aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source Luke. API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls etc. in a programming library. BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts. GUI: graphical user interface. UIL: the User Interface Language part of OSF/Motif which lets programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple outline form WCL: the Widget Creation Language a package which extends the understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 UIMS: User Interface Management System ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?) The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients you need to read and understand the ICCCM  in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager.  Get it either: - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys X Window System book - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0 X Protocol Reference Manual. A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete. The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the presentation. [from David Rosenthal 10/90] - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's Programmer's Supplement for Release 5. The complete document is on the R5 tapes. Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in RTFM and is the most-important of the least-read X documents. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium and how do I join? The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment. MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations). Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations. Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design with others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.

[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution from which this information is adapted.] [2/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif? OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF members. OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF. However there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif at the user's choice. OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications. [Thanks to Ian Darwin ian@sq.com 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows? Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager filemgr shelltool etc.). [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM) 8/90; 4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows? DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI toolkit including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager dxcalendar dxpsview etc.). (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX? PEX is the PHiGS Extension to X. PHiGS stands for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics. Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals. [last modified 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is low-bandwidth X (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP? There are several options for using X over serial lines: SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time). PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable. XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server.  There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem: (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly connected) and (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and (3)	In addition to the effects of #2 it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress. LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6. Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files: XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX [information provided by Jim Fulton jim@ncd.com; 7/92] There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers? The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout decoration and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM): wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3 uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape. twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager. awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality olwm (AT&T): ditto gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives including the one on the R5 tape vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version vtwm-5.0 is based on R5.9 and is available from export. [3/92] tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. 4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)? It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window whether or not you kill or restart your window manager. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session like toolplaces does? Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. Look for the application xplaces on an archive-server near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database. [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager? DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line naming the full pathname: sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate? You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using xset r on|off. The X protocol however doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate which is a capability not supported by all systems. Some servers running on systems that support this however may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm) you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options -ar1 350 -ar2 30 to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string? There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places just rearranges keys and does not do macro expansion. Some (few) clients including xterm and several X-based editors accept a translation resource such as: xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>F1: string(setenv DISPLAY unix:0) which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string use \nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. Window managers which could provide this facility do not yet; nor has a special remapper client been made available. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David B.

The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command: csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.] Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2 available on export [8/92] is the most recent. xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. xprint by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z. To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools you can use xpr which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output. The XV program can grab a portion of the X display manipulate it and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities. Also: Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0 an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter. ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility image-processing and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers. Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems for example have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer. Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display? If you need color PostScript in particular you can - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript such as xgrabsc and xv - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this as is the Xim package. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor? This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for e.g.  capturing the frame-buffer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X? The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps gray-scale images and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular) which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22). Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export. Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93. xv (X Image Viewer) written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley) can read and display pictures in Sun Raster PGM PBM PPM X11 bitmap TIFF GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust color intensity contrast aspect ratio crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display manipulate on it and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z. The Img Software Set by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu> reads and writes its own image format displays on an X11 screen and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z along with large collection of color images. The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-* weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-* and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*. Xim The X Image Manipulator by Philip Thompson does essential interactive displaying editing filtering and converting of images. There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif xwd xbm tiff rle xim (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications. ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM TIFF GIF SUN Raster etc) are included. xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions. A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] [some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov) 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window? The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar. A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell: echo ESC]2;TEXT^G where ESC is the escape key TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character). Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories: alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G' The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit '0' instead and use '1' to change only the icon name. Note: another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself. Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences? The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z. O'Reilly's Volume 3 the X User's Guide includes an R5 version of the control sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93 and a Motif version of the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93] Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter). In a pinch a VT100 manual will do. [last updated 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm et al fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ? In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut you need to stty pass8 but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font such as XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.] In addition you may want to set this in your shell: setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1 For a given character above 127 you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') is Alt-'. [thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea (gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small? You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give a resource specification like this: xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window this is OK as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly: xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection? You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. However a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z which can be adapted to do this. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources? You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): %N      The value of the filename parameter or the application's class name. %T      The value of the file type.  In this case the literal string app-defaults %C      customization resource (R5 only) %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L      Language locale and codeset (e.g. ja_JP.EUC) %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ja) %t      The territory part of the display's language string %c      The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is Myterm. Also suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11 then in /usr/openwin. Let's consider another example. This time let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless. With R5 there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example you might run the myterm application like this: myterm -xrm *customization: -color If one of your pathname specifications had the value /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C then the expanded pathname would be /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is <root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%N%C:\     (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N: <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to . a single dot.  In R3 all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ./ a dot followed by a slash. [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window? The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line DisplayManager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: #!/bin/sh #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste.  Note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client. [Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu) 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file? When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file the normal place you can make your .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with #!/bin/csh. If this doesn't work also try starting off with: #!/bin/sh # Reset path: PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine? There are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv DISPLAY ... whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X. One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It includes xrsh a script to start an X application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar. One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1 in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables. [11/90] In addition if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host and you find rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname) then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be xrsh <HOST> xterm #! /bin/sh # start an X11 process on another host # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu> # rsh $host -n setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null # # An improved version: # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson jr@bbn.com) #       (generalized for shksh by Keith Boyer keith@cis.ohio-state.edu) # # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

One way is to use the bitmap client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information. The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. An easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63] possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers. The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors XPM1 pixmaps and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed [5/91] in export:/contrib. If you are a MetaFont user you can use mftobdf from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK GF and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu. The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font formats. The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font. Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)? After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler installed it in some directory and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path *or* if the directory is already in the path use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.) Sometimes your xset +fp $dir command fails with a BadValue error: X Error of failed request:BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath) This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious.) -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file system?  Remember it's the server not the client which interprets your font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. xset +fp ~/myfonts) and the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm. -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file fonts.dir.  If you can't find that file run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're running OpenWindows look for the file Families.list.  If you can't find it run bldfamily(1).) -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows for example) make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using. Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files it won't work for Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files it won't work for X11Rn. [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  40)  How do I convert a .snf font back to .bdf font? A tool called snftobdf 1.4 is part of the bdftools package which is available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format? der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be used as an anything-to-BDF converter but requires access to a server that can understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91] In addition the R5 program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server? The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers which do not use the MIT font scheme. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add .bdf fonts to my DECwindows server? The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the .pcf format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts with a performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this: xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because of this writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com) 4/90] However: A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap. The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs including the GWM window manager by AT&T in its olpixmap editor and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM distribution available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works. You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first item like this: basic*text.translations:  #override \ Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \n\ Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line() ^ extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation definition. [Thanks to Timothy J. Horton 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones? One solution is xchron in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x which can show the time for timezones other than the local one. Alternatively you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock or use a script similar to this: #!/bin/sh TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name San_Luis_Obispo_CA 2> /dev/null & TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name King_Of_Prussia_PA 2> /dev/null & ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  47)  I have xmh but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH? The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list of various ftp uucp e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z. If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list you can request a copy of the FAQ which also includes a section on xmh by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server? After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started no other clients are able to connect to it. The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3 at least) delete old (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix which contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add ! -type s to the find exclusion in the cron job. [10/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen? The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens sorry. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun? Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available. The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z . The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se. [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se) 8/92] A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X? Generally report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly from MIT please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.] [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu> 5/91; 12/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get Warning: Widget class version mismatch? This error which typically goes on to say widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003 indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure. However the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems in particular were shipped with the flawed version of the library and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster? Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster it asked that server sites close off external access. [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in pub/webster/NeXT-2.0.] Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access you are probably out of luck. However if you are a legitimate site you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability illegality and non-availability of dictionary servers.

No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not public domain which has a specific legal meaning. However the X distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee. Contributed software though may be placed in the public domain by individual authors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3 R4 and R5? What changes are there? The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree. [Stephen Gildea 1/92] The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)? Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from Software Center Technology Licensing Office Massachusetts Institute of Technology 28 Carleton Street Room E32-300 Cambridge MA 02142-1324 phone: 617-258-8330. You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies. PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network. Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a guide to the distribution.

"1","(please respond via email!) Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net. The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me). The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors. We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around in the xcms code in Xlib but without some understanding of the theory I have no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the above-mentioned programs work on their systems or let me know if they fail for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have. Any hints? Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

"1","Archive-name: x-faq/part3 Last-modified: 1993/04/04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5? The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup. Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X11. People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch. Here are a few complications: 1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request 5a 5b 5c and 5d separately 2) the file sunGX.uu which was part of an earlier patch was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris] 3) fix 8 is in two parts: 8a and 8b 4) fix 13 is in three parts: 13a 13b and 13c 5) fix 16 is in two parts: 16a and 16b 6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite which previously was optional 7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for PEXlib.uu.[1234]. 8) fix 22 is in 9 parts 22a through 22i ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive? The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response. Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). The xstuff server treats the Subject: header line just like any other line of the message. The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it. 1) The command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file. 2) if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. For example you can say send index fixes (or index fixes). A message that requests an index cannot request data. 3) if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name an item you give its directory and its name. For example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota it sends the requests out shortest-first. 4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses.  If you use such a mailer you won't get any response.  If you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it. The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If your mailer deals in ! notation try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Motif 1.1.2 is also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5? Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5. Motif 1.1 available in source form from OSF as of August 1990 uses the vanilla X11R4 Intrinsics where vanilla means with just a few patches; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18 though. Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5 although there are some known new geometry-management problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK? Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape; the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.

[5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications) The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape. A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93): DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1 MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1 HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5 sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92] User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check that group for posting information. Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely- available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and international sites from which it may be ftp'ed. The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or earlier versions on the X11R3 X11R4 and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu). These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: sirius.ua.oz. The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu which tends to duplicate the export archives is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis at TB+ and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste] A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily (mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution the XTEST distribution an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies. The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K 2400 1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285. A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be: zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies To get a current listing of the files that are available download the file /usrX/ls-lR.Z. A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the file /usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX. The machine has just the one modem so please do not fetch large amounts of data at one sitting. [courtesy Mark Snitily 2/90] In addition UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4 tapes.  It also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  65)! Where can I get interesting widgets? The Free Widget Foundation (FWF) library sponsored by Brian Totty (totty@cs.uiuc.edu) is now [2/93] available on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in pub/fwf-v3.41.shar.Z.

Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt application know when it has been re-exposed resized and when it has received user key and mouse input. The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set -- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler() which loses a number of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality . At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for use. The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  68)  What is the current state of the world in X terminals?

[Kaleb Keithley kaleb@thyme.jpl.nasa.gov 12/91; the file was updated 24 Mar 1993.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  75)  Where can I get an X terminal server for my low-end Sun 3/50? Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current version [1.4 as of 8/91 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu [128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped so it is fairly fast and needs little disk space. A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun like this example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU: #! /bin/sh exec >/dev/console 2>&1 /etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0 case $? in 0)	;; 4)	/etc/reboot -q -n ;; 8)	echo ND fsck failed - get help /etc/halt ;; 12)	echo Interrupted /etc/reboot ;; *)	echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help /etc/halt ;; esac /bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1 /etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp /etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255 /etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11 /etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null set `/etc/ifconfig le0` exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \ `(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)` ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL Simula Prolog Miranda. Also some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well. They also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory and some stuff about comms. The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching. The one critiscism I would level at the course which I would have thought invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months) but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course. Yes I know this sounds like a plug for the course why not! Mackem Ian."

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect) that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window manager does not know about this you cannot move resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root window.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4 20MB of additional essential binaries almost 200MB of Sun patches fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings priced at only $250. Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk set the first containing what's ready and needed now the second available later in '92 containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks. The SUG 1992.1 disk which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside. The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC Macintosh and other workstations as well) and contains a total of 543MB of material including: X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution thus four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias toward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts and are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true but there are statistics.  Furthermore most software engineering at Ford gets done by electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming. But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself."

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case. You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool. You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources. Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() regularly."

What I like about GUI's: - The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects files text directories etc. and and manipulate them in some way such as delete copy paste rename ... - The ability to have several applications / screens visible and accessable at the same time. - Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use. If it has a GUI I can usually accomplish what I want to do fairly easily the command line on the other hand often is a long and painful experience. What I hate about GUI's: - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a computer with one hand and use the other for holding something like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be done with one hand such as navigating cutting pasting searching opening and saving files etc. The main thing I need to use both hands for is entering text. I guess I need to get one of those mice with like 20 buttons or something and then I will have the best of both worlds. Brent"

"1","Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try anyway. I am running xterm and like all UNIX users I run man <something>. Recently I switched to Solaris 2.1 and their man pages are littered with .I directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2 I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining.... So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under .I directives for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling it. (.B directives are fine I like them. And of course I don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) Somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font but not an italic font??

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the way through reading it and it looks like a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. I don't think it's stock MIT but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially. Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock Xterm Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients etc).  If you use more than one then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. Saves screen real estate. 2) mclock suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below. If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z ...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog!  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it. Specifically: How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax. I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway. Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - - Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster. From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw etc) - These take up RAM and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu mouse settings { Mouse Settings:			f.title   Very Fast				! xset m 7 10 &   Normal (Fast)			! xset m 3 10 &   System Default (Un-Accelerated)	! xset m default &   Glacial				! xset m 0 10 & } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out: - For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions corrections or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

"1","Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app-defaults file... check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults depending on how your system is set up. Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. I don't think it's stock MIT but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially. Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock Xterm Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients etc).  If you use more than one then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. Saves screen real estate. 2) mclock suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below. If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z ...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog!  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it. Specifically: How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax. I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway. Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - - Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster. From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw etc) - These take up RAM and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu mouse settings { Mouse Settings:			f.title   Very Fast				! xset m 7 10 &   Normal (Fast)			! xset m 3 10 &   System Default (Un-Accelerated)	! xset m default &   Glacial				! xset m 0 10 & } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out: - For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions corrections or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

"1","Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app-defaults file... check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults depending on how your system is set up. Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif in fact MWM and Motif can work without each other and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface. You cannot say A Porsche looks like a VW K鋐er ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

"1","...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and action-based and the other symbol-based. True but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.) I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all that's what I do too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system. I don't recall the actual stats but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorized as a symbol manipulator. It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers financial analysts structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming and programming is not required to do what they do. To restate my previous point: yes users want to build their own solutions; no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this."

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++ WWL InterViews GINA++ and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned but the resulting code looks little like Motif and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising but I haven't found a free version with Motif support and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task. At this point my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now but in our environment we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve. - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  If money can't buy happiness daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.

My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so.

An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel"

I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is."
"1","Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides.

"1","Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco. The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include: lightweight Objects such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading This by no means captures the complete content of the paper.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel"

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself). Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif. On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available. The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5 since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it? Cheers Tom McConnell -- Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com Intel Corp.

Begging everyone's pardon I was not slamming Motif nor was I necessarily plugging/flaming the two.

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience) and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position I believe is a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards. It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds. Mrs. Henne"

"1","I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens and not multiple X displays.   Given this: - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? What are they; who sells them... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead)? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application.

"1","G'Day Windows NT is a step forward but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system: Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. Object oriented.

Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean: > 	-) multi-screen > 	-) multi-headed > 	-) multi-display > 	-) X-Server zaphod mode As applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms.  multi-headed tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg a Sun with a cg4 display).  multi-screen and multi-display would if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning of multi-display would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers when it's used it probably refers to the same thing multi-screen would: a system that provides multiple Screens. zaphod is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen. > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ? There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth or a border-pixel and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Normally MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become washed out (nearly invisible).

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display 3 2-screen displays 6 1-screen displays or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT this is 3. As released by Megatek this is 12. As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more. -- ---- Rusty Sanders Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or... ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!"
"1","The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on... I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and returns.  The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() { XtAppContext app; Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(); int junk = 0; Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(top); //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents for (int i=0;i<=10;i++) { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(app &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE??? XtUnrealizeWidget(top); XtDestroyWidget(top); XtDestroyApplicationContext(app); XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d Serial number of failed request:  71 Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time) I get: Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice. So finally my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"1","I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine.  BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions but I'm *really* confused. -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown"
"1","Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc. will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0 and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown"
"1","Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it). I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

"1","Hello Motif World a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is."
"1","Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpywidthheight) Display *dpy; int width height; { Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; XSetWindowAttributes attr; fprintf(stderrOpening 8 bit window...\n); if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpyDefaultScreen(dpy)8PseudoColor&vinfo)) { fprintf(stderrYour display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n); exit(1); } fprintf(stderrUsing visual: %x\nvinfo.visual->visualid); cmap = XCreateColormap( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) vinfo.visual AllocNone ); XSync(dpyFalse); XInstallColormap(dpycmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */ attr.colormap = cmap; win = XCreateWindow( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) 1010 widthheight CopyFromParent       /* border width */ 8                    /* depth */ InputOutput          /* class */ vinfo.visual         /* visual */ CWColormap &attr ); return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel"

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself). Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif. On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available. The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5 since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it? Cheers Tom McConnell -- Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com Intel Corp.

Can someone help me? It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem and have given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what keys it will accept and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun from my HP and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not sufficient or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work. However I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work and I do some customised things with them. Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem and I am using exactly the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience) and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position I believe is a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards.

"1","I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens and not multiple X displays.   Given this: - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? What are they; who sells them... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead)? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application.

"1","G'Day Windows NT is a step forward but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system: Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly. In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth or a border-pixel and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display 3 2-screen displays 6 1-screen displays or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT this is 3. As released by Megatek this is 12. As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more. -- ---- Rusty Sanders Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or... ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!"
"1","The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on... I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and returns.  The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() { XtAppContext app; Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(); int junk = 0; Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(top); //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents for (int i=0;i<=10;i++) { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(app &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE??? XtUnrealizeWidget(top); XtDestroyWidget(top); XtDestroyApplicationContext(app); XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d Serial number of failed request:  71 Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time) I get: Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice. So finally my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported but not the hardware?

"1","Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc. will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0 and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown"
"1","Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it). I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

"1","Hi Folks. As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own. In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id how do you change the icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes any difference I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE. Thanks - Scott :)"
"1","Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5 The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation system) did work in R4 but refused to in R5. Of cause the R4-version did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition). Since compiling with R5 the program causes a zero width or height error (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText widgets) exist XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is mapped. The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?"

"1","If you're willing to do a little work you can make DrawnButtons do what you want more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system. We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence. Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You can make things look circular enough. -- Skip (montanaro@crd.ge.com) Why can't X be this easy? -- me after learning about dlopen()"

Anyone have any ideas ?? I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself. To give you a real-world example here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns. But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 10 working programs running you'll know it. Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing) you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...) -- Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!"

"1","(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered) Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped. The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow tickle the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item. What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?"

"1","I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed. Currently to draw interactively I begin with: /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */ /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */ palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red; palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green; palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue; XStoreColors( myDisplay my_cmap &palette_colors[DrawIndex] 1); XFlush( myDisplay); XSetFunction( myDisplay gc GXxor); XSetForeground( myDisplay gc drawIndex); Then to draw I do: XDrawLine( myDisplay XtWindow( drawingArea1) gc x1 y1 x2 y2); XFlush( myDisplay); And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do: XSetFunction( myDisplay gc GXcopy); What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image). Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong? david"

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information then you can use XClearArea to generate an Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the enclosing rectangle of your new item. This is still not great since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn. If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything you'll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the existing scene. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Yang        Silicon Graphics Inc. mikey@sgi.com           415/390-1786"

A pure X application could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.

Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me with XOpenWindow? I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also most of the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls.  From this initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this true?

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after updating the datastructures though... -Rob"

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap. It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications are having to make do with it's colormap. This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap. My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color (if this is an option for the application). - Doug Shaker voice:	415/572-0200 fax:	415/572-1300 email:	dshaker@qualix.com mail:	Qualix Group 1900 S.

If I understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib graphics on the window. It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects you can use XCreateRegion to create a region XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look.

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment came from a simple open-draw-quit client. As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object and then call the window_redraw() (or whatever) directly?  Although depending on how the overall application is structured there may be no problem with rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

"1","I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip). When xlock +nolock is running and I am working remotely or in batch (at) mode the runtime of my programs (as timed by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if xlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my runtimes yet this is very consistent! Any explanations real or imagined :) thanx dale@frostedflakes.llnl.gov"
"1","Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4 Xt Intrisics Programming Manual chapter 3. popup dialog boxes and so on. In example 3.5 page 76 : Creating a pop-up dialog box The application creates window with a button Quit and Press me. The button Press me pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd 4th .... time) it is *much* slower. Has anyone any experience with these sample programs or why I get this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response time from 2nd time onwards ? Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time ? Thankyou - Shirley"

"1","We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use. I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into. Send your comments/wish-list raving et. al. about DevGuide to: Tali.Aben@Sun.COM Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this and computers may have a future. Frankly I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability pointed out in March's SunExpert magazine. Technology works we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is outstanding."

"1","[posted for a friend] Okay I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this but I know its come up before... XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order: Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits) Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match. and when all else fails Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors already allocated in the colormap. This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap and no unallocated cells then XAllocColor fails even when it has already allocated several other cells already and there are dozens of read-only cells already in the colormap. Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part? Any help appreciated Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)"

"1","Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well? My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not?

"1","I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually it seems that this is more of a GCC question because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. Basically there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in let's say CompositeP.h for instance the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget) but in several places in the HP source code they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one as the prototype suggests.  For example: (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w args p_num_args) Now GCC chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.

To incrementally update the contents of windows I use the following trick: 1. Set the window background to None 2. Call XClearArea(display window 0 0 0 0 True) 3. Restore the window background to its correct value. The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window. In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased) I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

X11R5 path level 23.  My X process is started by xdm. i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)! The setup is as follows: lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc tvtwm There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home directory. The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm login window as expected - very nice! Unfortunately when the users session is started the background of the tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an xterm window when the session has started the background is changed as expected. The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the the users session startup? ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters. ie: real key       key shown on screen ------------   ------------------- hash           back slash tilde          pipe double quote   at symbol pound          hash cursor key     not recognised This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and termcap as they seemed more uptodate. Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as expected! Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

Make sure you're using ssetroot which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm starts up it nukes the existing root window.  Use an ssetroot after tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a (sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&) You can also use VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename or just VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey. > ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised >     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating. I would dearly appreciate 1. an explanation of the standard RIGHT CORRECT way to give a window a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it; 2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my desired colormaps. By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this having tried everything reasonable or imaginable. Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this.  Please please please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing wrong/how to do it right!!!

"1","Hello Netlanders: I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod. My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows: 486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4 Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive. I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and inet utilities (tcp/ip). I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly. I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems. However if I try to access the tape drive while in X the machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the tape the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to startx again; the screen changes modes but the grey background pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system. I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem. I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same system.  If you can shed any light on the problem it would be appreciated. One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

"1","According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows e.g. a crosswire cursor for a DrawingArea things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know. The topics on busy cursors in the several FAQ's are not helpful since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Hans Geurtsen                       Phone: (31) (0) 8385 - 33157 Nucletron Research BV.             e-mail: hgn@nuclint.nl Surface: Waardgelder 1 NL-3905 TH  Veenendaal"

"1","Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office. Many thanks for all replies the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. On the PC side I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation. The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at `hostname`:1.0 Some comments on performance I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra 16 MB Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable.

"1","The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be Tek-term) is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus let me know.) The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space it stays an icon. The desired behavior: one of two options - 1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the inactive one. 2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated it should revert to a icon but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher level than the Xterm. What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands would I'd guess need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term. Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif. Thanks for your time.

If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM). xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS. A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT server. I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI by the way) which yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images running on a Sparc IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for animations. Regards Richard Gooch...."

"1","Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. Actually the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct?

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like /**/#This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines that This is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly?

"1","The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs New Mexico State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical Research. The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address is 128.123.1.12 but may change so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever possible). Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research. The Arabic Chinese French Italian Indian Japanese Korean Tibetan and Vietnamese archives will all be moved. We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once the archives have been moved. Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move everything. If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives we have been slowly collecting various software fonts and text for different languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and quantity of multi-lingual tools.

"1","A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program I am writing a library callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called it must initialize things and after that it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function. #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> void bla(XtAppContext app Widget top) { Widget topone = top;		// in real prog these are member vars XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class int junk = 0; Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp NULL NULL NULL NULL 0 &junk NULL); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass topone XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(topone); for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when Exit button clicked { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(theapp &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } XtDestroyWidget(box); XtCloseDisplay(dis); } // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app Widget *top) { int junk = 0; (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); } // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() { static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called static Widget top; static int setup = 0; if (!setup) { SetItUp(&app &top); setup = 1; } bla(app top); } // main - program which links to my library main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) { doit(); printf(sleeping...\n);//widget still on screen at this point sleep(5); } } The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the sleep in the main prog despite the XtDestroyWidget call). Anyone see something I'm missing? Thanks very much.

"1","I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out? How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry. In ORA Vol. 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to Vol. 4 it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For example the translation: Shift<Key>q:	quit() will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key (and the q key). This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do what I want but it doesn't it doesn't work if the user presses the control key the shift key and the o key. Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use XtInstallAccelerators().

"1","I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

"1","store and reply of mouse and keyboard events -------------------------------------------- To produce regression tests or automatic demo's we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user. It should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue an to store them in a file. This sequence of events stored in a file should be given to the server's queue as if a user is working. 1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all mouse and keyboard events (where)? 2. Where one can catch these events to store them ? In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP). Where can we catch all events coming from a given server. If this is not possible can we catch all events given to a certain client and how ? 3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ? Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ? Thanks in advance Ron."

Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using. Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps? These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much cheaper. Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running in XSynchonize mode. -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland"

"1","[again poseted for a friend] Okay I got such great response from my last question (thanks everyone) lets try again: How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only? I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color. Once I determine if a cell is read-only I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application. So far the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly... Any ideas? Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)"

A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is something that should be avoided. Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too?

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following platforms: SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) IBM (AIX 3.2) Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1 and GCC). DEC Ultrix. DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1). Documentation is available online. Changes since 0.13 include: o Added new resource gethostbynameIsEvil for Sun's that coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view window is closed for window managers too dull to do so themselves. o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. o Added 'Clear' button to Open box to allow more convenient cut-n-paste entries of URL's. o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False new document view windows will not be automatically positioned by the program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how they're placed). o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not right for authors and readers can't do anything about bad images in any case). o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy dana@thumper.bellcore.com). o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy bingle@cs.purdue.edu). o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some documentation.

Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it. This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later. Currently my solution is: XCreateWindow(...); XSetWMProperties(..); XMapWindow(...); XFlush(...); XMoveWindow(...); It works with olwm but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering if I'm overlooking something obvious. Richard."

"1","A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm) he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font. The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option) no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables. Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas? More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe) with the most current operating system and running X11R5. It is not mwm's fault as the same problems occur under twm etc."

"1","Hello I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent a unix clone OS for Intel architecture machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program). The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character and so on.  It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters. If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where I should look to find it it would be much appreciated.

Can anybody help me out? The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case: Ctrl Any<Key>q. >In ORA Vol. 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

For >example the translation: >	Shift<Key>q:	quit() >will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as >the Shift key (and the q key). This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations. >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? If you mean menu accelerator no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page. >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >can't use XtInstallAccelerators(). I can't think of a reason why not. >How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of >case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one >menu entry. There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget] set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell shell). For example applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade -- filePulldown - openPushbutton - exitPushbutton *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\ Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton ArmAndActivate)\n\ Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton ArmAndActivate) You have to write and add the application action PerformAction which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments. I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me but the more general approach I described above should work. -- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)"

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However I may have colormap questions later.....

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution. Actually I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side they were just about equal. The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps). Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?) and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs) so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one). In short: allowing all three forms of display within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network) and let the user pick whatever feels fastest. (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :) )Rob"

"1","I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough I have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning. In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles here's a crude picture: ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== | |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+ |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C + |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+ |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C but + |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  + |    +      window window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     + |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+ | ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need since I also insist on having a virtual WM. The only problem is that the title location is static that is  it is configured in .twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore I have implemented f.squeeze{ left center right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this: +---------+ + title A + +------------------------+ +   this is the          + +     body of the        + +      window window A  + +------------------------+ to this: +---------+ + title A + +------------------------+ +   this is the          + +     body of the        + +      window window A  + +------------------------+ =============== Okay. So far so good. Now how the heck do I get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of? One way would be to post in comp.windows.x a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing and hope that someone reads it. :-) In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing look back up at Figure 1 and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter the result is: +=========+   +---------+   +=========+ + title B +   + title A +   + title C + +-------------------------------------+ +   this is the body of the window   + +   window A which is on top.        + +-------------------------------------+ =================== The rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long. The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c: #ifdef SHAPE case F_SQUEEZELEFT: {	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT 0 0 }; if (DeferExecution (context func Scr->SelectCursor)) return TRUE; tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; SetFrameShape( tmp_win ); break; } .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif ( Of course you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h and add { f.squeezeleft FKEYWORD F_SQUEEZELEFT } ... and so forth ... to parse.c In order to use these functions add something like the following to your .twmrc file: Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter ================= About a year ago I posted this but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out. Since then blast has appeared in comp.sources.x Volume 19 Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

"1","| | Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu | Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some | documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server- | resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code | mentioned above... There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!). I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write) If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device. One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them. One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that in its sample implementation there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden violent death (e.g. kill).  You have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments. Ken -- Kenneth Whaley			 (408) 748-6347 Kubota Pacific Computer Inc.

"1","Hi Xperts! I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition. previously i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that  the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded. I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi 75dpi and misc. when i run xinit the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space. Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows  to just have my x-windows running. Thanks Pramod --"

First I create the shared memory segment attach the client attach the X server and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment only dies after all attachments are gone. Now if the client dies that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you) and since the X server notices the client has dies frees up it's resources including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment.

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have already written I am sure) and would therefore be probably be a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class. Is this more difficult (in principle not lines of code)? I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists  but you might consider this as an alternative. Alternatively if anyone has a multi-column list widget they could sell me this might save me from having to write one! Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not yet have the spec)? Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD widget sets  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port. -- Douglas S.

"1","I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me. I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer and since I don't have much experience with programming X I thought this issue might be helpful as it has a section on debugging and a section on the 40 most common errors in programming X. At the end of the errors section there are the following references for tutorials on X programming style.  They are: Rosenthal David -   A simple X11 client program Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference 1988. Lemke D. and Rosenthal D. -  Visualizing X11 clients Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference 1989. Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably) electronic form?

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around etc.  But for most work the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.) I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced. All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). -- \---------------------------------------------------------------------/ \ Seth Buffington 	U.S.S.

"1","I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like /**/#This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines that This is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly?

Can someone help me? Unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example the sequence ESC [ 1 B 7 would indicate that the HOME key was pressed with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such as shift-Return. If anybody wants these changes they're welcome to them but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file x11term.c.  Maybe if someone at OSF is interested I can send them the tweaks but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest I'll post the mods somewhere although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it. Notes: * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual. * The patches I made were to version 18.58 under Sun OS 4.1.2 [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.] Two ways: 1) When you start the xterm you can use command line options: -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly: The basic escape sequence is: ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2' '1' or '0' depending on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title or both and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string. Hence this command will set the window & icon title: echo \033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c To set just the icon title: echo \033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c To set just the window title: echo \033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c Of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax depending on how the echo command works on your system and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics under Bourne or Korn shells). [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string instead of using convenient octal sequences.] If you want your titlebar updated continously say to show your current directory hostname or somesuch then you'll have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage() what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff. To speak about POVRay the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good especially in speed protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance.

Thanks for this clue and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the same direction. One solution due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up we SetValue its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem.) The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows: 1) Use twm or mwm rather than olwm 2) Use olwm with resource *wmTimeout: 10 3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed. This is obviously working around some bug somewhere. Thanks -- Chris Ho-Stuart"
"1","I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently although I will also be working with Open Look in the future. What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say for example that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A. From the research and testing I've done so far it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch. The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice. Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup. Cheers....

"1","Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget. Unfortunately I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines and things of that sort?  Or barring that a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself? Any and all help would be very appreciated. Many thanks ---Mark =============================================================================== Mark A. DeLoura       deloura@cs.unc.edu      U of North Carolina Chapel Hill"

But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ | window of my application I get my colormap. I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell and so it won't allow cmap focus either. Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path. (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit you can set cmap focus explicit also but you then need a binding to f.focus_color probably on MB1). -- David Brooks					dbrooks@osf.org Open Software Foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote"

Now I'm bewildered by the huge number of standards that open systems has created. I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools here were produced with the Athena Widget set or X Intrinsics or Xw (??). In my humble opinion they look like crap.  I don't know however if this is a characteristic of the tookits or just poor aestetic taste in the programmers. I would like my app to look a little more sculptured like mwm.  I understand however that mwm isn't free like the other tookits. I am getting Linux so I will have InterViews but I don't know how it will look.

Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1 X11R5 Server Hardware:	Sun IPC Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1 Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37) A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun DecWindows Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users. I have tried the following things: 1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch (100444-37). 2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm. 3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110). This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method) and screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help but I was still able to get the application to hang. Repeat By: This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times. Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up) Click and release on a menu item Repeat until application hangs Any help would be appreciated.

I tried it without the pipe by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud and got the same error from xwud.

"1","Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools but they are 1) heavy 2) hard to find when you need one 3) limited in their software expandibility 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis 5) cannot be remotely operated and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS requiring much manual manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump but we found it 1) too difficult for most people 2) did not have enough information for many protocols 3) could not be used interactively 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features. Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better. The following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional processing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1 New features: Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r' the file type will be automatically detected. Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file. The hex format has been changed. New time options have been added. Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets. Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag) New flags: -R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed except for reading from stdin -ttt	prints delta times -tttt	prints times relative to the first frame -W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

"1","We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi. Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese' each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1 jisx0208 or so. We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is. We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'. //I18N.h // This may look like C code but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.hv 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $ #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H #include <X11/Xlib.h> extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str	/* IN */ int wc_len		/* IN */ char *buf		/* OUT */ int *buflen		/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len	/* OUT */ char **charset);	/* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc); #endif /* _I18N_H */ //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.ccv 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include I18N.h extern C { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include Xlocaleint.h #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale const wchar_t* int char* int* int* int*); extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale _CSID); extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale _CSID); }; int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str/* IN */ int wc_len		/* IN */ char *buf		/* OUT */ int *buf_len		/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len	/* OUT */ char **charset)	/* OUT */ { XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert(); int ctid; int status; Charset *xcharset; status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale wc_str wc_len buf buf_len scanned_len &ctid); if (status == Success) { xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale ctid)); *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL; } else *charset = NULL; return status; } ---------------- An included file above Xlocaleint.h is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled. A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01. When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing: _Xmbctidtocsid (code) _Xmbfscs (code) _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code) _XFallBackConvert (code) We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used its internal functions. The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution. My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5. In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. Any help or comments would be highly appreciated. I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.

As I've said before there's no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented you can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several layers of windows.

This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have to say? With regard to dialup X11 implementations there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies including both GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.) NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such software packages available. X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX) and is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various sorts of hardware.

"1","Hi Xperts this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)... I'm using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by PANEL_MAX_VALUE! As I understand PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items doesn't work in the case of slider despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: /* Panel_multiline_text_item Panel_numeric_text_item * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */ PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM			 152) PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT		 182) which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute and returns value 0. Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields but not Sun's Xview... Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me and clear this problem? Any help is very much appreciated. Yuri yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy"
"1","I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The hardware is truecolor in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X clients.  The three problems I see are: 1) The colormap though huge is static. 2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide. 3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error. Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask: will these limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of e.g. 8 bits but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary. I know there are no absolutes but I'd appreciate hearing people's opinions and suggestions.  Thanks! -- Frederick G. M.

Bounding rectangle operations are sufficient for object selection.

I wanted to get some measurement of response time so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window maps it and sends the first Expose event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event to receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program. Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program available from ftp.uu.net which bombards the server with graphics operations but I just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is acceptable interactive response time.

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor. The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got picked up by the child.

"1","We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully started we run an xterm as the console - the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  Refresh window fails to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them. At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1. We're running X in color and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the B/W framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted. My question is: has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages? Please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk. Hugh McIntyre. INMOS Ltd. Bristol UK.

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were: 1) Clients written with logic like the following: if (DefaultDepth() != 1) /* Assume default depth is 8bit */ These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window to run correctly. 2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much and just outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class with a dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes but many clients don't bother to check they just start throwing XStoreColor calls at you. Though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland"

I used to think this way and not just about X. For example incorrect English constructs such as its raining or it's window id annoy me. However there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!). On a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour - being Irish and hence using English English as opposed to American English I always use the latter except of course for API terms such as XAllocColor and colormap. In a world that uses the term Windows to refer to Microsoft Windows perhaps the time has come to accept X Windows as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say the X Window System and let's face it almost everyone uses it. Ultimately we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect product recognition is important and a short snappy descriptive title (X is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called Microsoft Windows or the Microsoft Window System or how about just plain Microsoft! To summarise (or should that be summarize) the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be windowing system). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. Gerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk) Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd."

Well yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate but I do think it's worth pointing out that popular usage is not always sufficient excuse. In this case for example I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably not. The same is true of X.  The X Window System X X11 and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  In fact some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point. As for the trade publications that promulgate things like X Window or X.windows or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong? Popular usage is as it may be but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness. >Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS >was really down to popular opinion (I know we all think it's(!) technically >superior as well!). X11 technically superior to NeWS?  Well in *some* alternate universe perhaps ..."

A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting though only Consortium members will be able to vote. This year's theme is Application Construction by Non-Programmers Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have however been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as What is needed for application construction by non-programmers? Can we avoid programming altogether or is a simple language needed? Is it sufficient to create applications or must users be able to create new widgets? Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves? Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System including applications experience with users new objects reviews of and proposals for revision of internal Andrew protocols We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration. Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June. Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

Archie provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp sites by examining directories returned as query matches and allows you to retrieve files located this way. Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4 R5 and a variety of other flavors of X and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows: * Major improvements include: - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new features (FWF MultiList widget). - Ability to expand directories in browser. - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation. - Ability to save and reload query results as well as print them. - Ability to resort results and sort results by user-definable pseudo-weights. - Online help browser. - Color resources done so that they don't break mono displays. - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations. - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Enjoy! Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is. 8< - 8< - Hello Motif World over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved a few defaults have been changed and a lot of other small things have been added. This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x. Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours) and delete all previous copies. Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT: HISTORY The University of Lowell supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation has developed a wrapper-library that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell. I Ronald van Loon at a certain point last year have taken the Lowell bindings fixing the bugs I came across adding missing memberfunctions and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC). NEW RELEASE I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings. This release offers: - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset - Two additional widgets written by myself that can be used to indicate progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake and its config files on your site. I have tried to provide the bindings with a standard Makefile tweakable for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif X and C++ previously posted on Usenet. WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS Ftp: Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) directory /pub/X11. Note: Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours. Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings. E-mail: Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail and I will send the bindings by e-mail. REQUEST Those who use the bindings and find bugs or see room for improvement please contact me and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs a bug-fix of course ;-).

I'd like to take the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message server and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it since the Sun-supplied textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk. However the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For example the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a dropsite in the main control area while the source in contrib/xview knows nothing about drag and drop. The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50 dated 5/22/90 while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says: textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro So does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?

It seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.

Specifically it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1 and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). Currently the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface such as the SPARCstation2. Xavier has been tested in the following environments: SUN: Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1 NEC(EWS): Machine : EWS4800/210230 OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1Release5.2 C++     : C++ Release3.1 It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/ (Xavier.large-demo.tar and Xavier.tar) We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier. If you are interested please contact xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. I will add your e-mail address to our list.

"1","I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps. The X11R5 documentation says: Usually a window manager creates these colormaps.  I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps. Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps. However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black. So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps. Finally the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation XmuStandardColormap and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation. According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436): For GrayScale colormaps only the colormap red_max red_mult and base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored. To compute a GrayScale pixel value use the following expression: (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF XmuGetColormapAllocation defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c is used by XmuLookupStandardColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c to select red_max green_max and blue_max values for the call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the total number of cells in the gray scale sets green_max to 59% of the total number and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number. Referring to section 14.3 one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale. When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified XmuStandardColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c sets red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3 one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored. When red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal 1 XmuCreateColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c constructs a gray map. The sum of red_max green_max and blue_max gives the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3 on would expect red_max to give the maximum gray value."

Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority. The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup.

Perhaps > if every application used standard colormaps things would > be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use > standard colormaps. Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT. I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5). If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer. Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland"

"1","I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat commonplace so I'm sending a net-feeler. I have a display that is a non-interlaced memory mapped 1-bit 720x280 display.  The server's view of the world (obtained via xwd | xwud) seems to be exactly what it should be.  However the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes which isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- to: --- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display) or to pad only to byte boundries? I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2 under Mach 3.0. Thanks Brian"
"1","These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions. 1.  If my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt all O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent() I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier requirements. 2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord and their right/left sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the xy coord of the window manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget() immediately checking the xy after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border. Any help would be most appreciated. Darcy darcy_mccallum@mentorg.com"
"1","I have the following problem on X11R5 servers. When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored. Normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window no expose event is sent. When ExposureMask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws. Everything works fine with X11R4. Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)? Is it something I do wrong? Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)? Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

"1","We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e. the w of (w client call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some instances but bogus in other instances. We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23 patches (with the MotifBC flag set) we recompiled Motif and then we recompiled the application. Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should have used?  Should we have left Motif alone? Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

"1","Hi there (I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response so I'm posting here.) I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720). It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets.  However this digitiser makes use of the serial port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver. The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number). I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I? What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a specific X application)?  If so what were the steps required for installation? Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"1","I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core  and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.

With Imake-TeX you will never again have to fiddle around with calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex bibtex). Simply type make and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date.

"1","Hi ppl I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. I have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11 so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr. My first impression was very good I was able to get Z and Y straight :) There's still a little problem I can't solve however: I cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets. The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work. I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry Mode_switch which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift but what is the 3rd?? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't. If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them help would be appreciated. CU Alaric"

So I doesn't returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe. I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may be able to clarify. 1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !! Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes.

"1","Hi I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to fork GDB off as a subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program the following happens : PROGRAM : main() { int x; printf(enter x : ); scanf(%d &x); printf(x = .%d.\n x ); } OUTPUT : The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type in a value (like 5) then all the printf's output comes out at one time. Is there any other way besides using PIPES to do this i.e. like ioctl or something else ??

"1","Hello X'ers I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes.

On the client side I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request. As far as I can tell from the manual the only attribute which may give a BadMatch is the colormap if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the visual was correctly matched as I did not get the error message. What am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error.

The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the MenuButton section of the Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface documentation states bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label. One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap resource but remember that you or a user of your application won't be able to set it from a resource file.

First at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand how to deliver the magic cookie and won't run on a display with authorization turned on. Second we have people with client software on remote machines and I really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support Xauthorization. So what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization. (Yes I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals but non-privileged users can't do this.) I've checked with the HP Support Line and there doesn't appear to be a way. Can anyone confirm this or do you know of a way to accomplish what I want? BTW I'm running HPUX 9.0 and Vue 3.0.

Most generic unix software works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips.

I know of several such programs idraw xfig. tgif. I have no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles arcs straight lines boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential but in fact very handy: preservation of connection. If I move one part of the drawing the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing stay connected. Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics flow charts logic diagrams data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it.

To accomodate AIX version 3.2 we have created a patch to the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch.  For those without internet access a 3.5 diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending or faxing a purchase order to the address below. The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host. Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2. ----------- The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create use and mail multi-media applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts indentation and other typography but also  contains embedded raster images spreadsheets drawing editors equations simple animations and so on. These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects including text. AUIS has three components: The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set of applications beginning with the ez text editor a help system a system monitoring tool an editor-based shell interface and other editors corresponding to the various available types of objects. The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable object-oriented user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that come with the system. The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail management strategies and implements many advanced  features including authentication return receipts automatic sorting of mail vote collection and tabulation enclosures audit trails of related messages and subscription management. It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function personal computers in addition to high-function workstations. The current public release of Andrew Version 5.1  includes support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart multimedia mail.  A newer release 5.2 for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings images fonts and user preferences. Remote Andrew Demo Service You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups. To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service simply run the following command on your machine: finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu The service will give you further instructions.

"1","REPOST: I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

"1","One way to mask the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case it is the show_mouse_position function. If the XEvent arrive in this function as XEvent p_event; then the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. By the way you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button.

"1","I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif but I'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about this problem........ - I am using an XmTextField and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString. The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed the text is getting truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english everything works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns. (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual application just in my sample code to make things easier) - I am running Motif 1.2 X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts. - Don't know if this matters but my dialog box and TextField is initially created with UIL. The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. Please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program. THANKS!!!!!!!! - Susan swalker@bbn.com 617-873-8190"

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the X protocol and a bug in the Xt intrinsics. The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (xy) position given in ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. At this point the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date. If a SetValues is done using the same (xy) position the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there.  However a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same.) The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (xy) positioning information in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in gorier details. s'marks -- Stuart W. Marks				stuart.marks@eng.sun.com Window Systems Technology		2550 Garcia Ave. M/S 21-228 SunSoft Inc.

Even more when I realise how much a burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better than I like C++. But sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments that come close to NeXTSTEP the appkit etc. Also environs that support rapid prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want to do real work. Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews (what it is exactly I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I started with NeXTSTEP.)

"1","At the moment I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3 and OpenWindows 2.0. This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For example when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2 display I can't open the compose window. I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start the X programs. Is there a ready to go binairy of the X11 server for my configuration (I have read something about Xsun) or must I compile the X11 stuff by myself? Any help is welcome V.

"1","Hello I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2 X11R5 Motif and xdt3. I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X. I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T' but that doesn't work. xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc and not to the call to X. The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact it tells me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file. So far the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc. I would rather not do it this way.

"1","> It is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had. Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of changes that the GNU COPYLEFT is protecting us. Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide- shows because of its -loop feature that display does not have (display from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D) but I think I will implement it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

"1","I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap. I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap. Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values or is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap but couldn't get that to work either. Any help would be appreciated. -------------------------------------- Don Lemoine Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division Dahlgren VA 22405 (703)663-7917 dlemoin@xobu.nswc.navy.mil"

(Arrghhh!!)  ]] With renewed interest in setting the DISPLAY variable etc.. I thought I would post my contribution. This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent about what it's doing so that you should be able to type rx host.domain.etc and get a xterm running on host.domain.etc with all the difficult stuff taken care of. In theory this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it doesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a rx big-machine make for instance for a backgrounded make on the remote big-machine. For more details and a full list of features read the README file about 20 lines below...

Version 3.1.7 X XCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk> X XTrivial to install but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial. X XThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed just Xedit the rx.pl file and read the comments.  Once you've done Xthis you can xmkmf then make install install.man. X XFEATURES: X X*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  Including X   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names and passing X   magic cookies or doing the xhost stuff. X X*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...) X X*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy. X X*) Custom command execution - link it to remacs to get a remote X   emacs command. X X*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname X   and turns on login shell. X X*) Default command is xterm. X X*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user may X   extend the list of variables to pass. X X*) Special handling for bourne shell users. X X*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local. X   That is it propagates $PWD in an intelligent manner. X X*) Logs errors in a file. X X*) Overall Intelligence (TM) - makes reasoned decisions about what X   you are trying to do and tries to do the right thing. X X*) Written in Perl for portability and hackability.

X] X.SH DESCRIPTION XThe X.B rx Xprogram connect to the specified X.I host Xand executes the specified X.I command Xin the background returning immediately.  To allow the execution Xof X programs it copies a number of environmental variables to Xthe remote session.  If you omit X.IR command  Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The X.B rxterm Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host and also passes X.I args Xto the remote xterm as arguments. X.PP XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local Xmachine while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote Xmachine. X.PP XIf the name of the file from which X.B rx Xis executed is anything other than ``rx'' X.B rx Xtakes this name stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command Xto run on the remote host using any X.I command Xparameters as arguments for the remote command. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xthinks you are using X.B xauth Xbased X authorisation and you are calling to a off-site host or Xto a different username it will attempt to copy an authorization Xkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use X.B xhost(1) Xto grant access to the remote host. X.SH OPTIONS X.TP X.BI \-l  username XUse X.I username Xas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence Xof this option the remote username is the same as your local username. X X.SH ENVIRONMENT XIf set the values of PATH DISPLAY XENVIRONMENT XAPPLRESDIR XXFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH OPENWINHOME LD_LIBRARY_PATH Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program unless the Xremote username is different or the remote host is off-site in which Xcase only DISPLAY is exported with in all cases any variables named in the Xvariable RXENV. X.PP XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate to contain as qualified Xa hostname as is needed. X.SH DIAGNOSTICS X.TP X.IB command : don't recognise my name. X.B rx Xcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case Xit prints a warning message and continues as normal. X.TP X.B rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...] XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.

X.SH SEE ALSO XX(1) rsh(1) xterm(1) xauth(1) xhost(1) gwm(1) X.SH BUGS X.B Rx Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the Xlocal user and the remote one depending on whether the remote Xhost is onsite or not and whether an alternative username was used Xor not. X.PP XIn particular if either the locally used shell or the remotely Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell X.B sh(1) Xthen strange things are more likely to happen.  Especially when Xit's only one of them. X.PP XSometimes quoting can get messed up. X.PP XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in X.B rx Xto make it believe something that is not true and fail because of it. X.PP XWhen X.B rx Xuses X.B xhost Xto grant access the X.B xhost Xcommand may fail silently. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine it will Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh.  If this happens you Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

X# X# Distribution limited as per the usual MIT copyright. X############################################################################## X# remote execution of X programs.  Based on a script in an old version of gwm. X# X# To install put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it. X#  Some configuration will be necessary see CONFIG comments... X# X# More and more this is less and less like the original.... X# X# Major hacked to work for our(my) set up and also partly X#  re-written to work with sh rather than ksh. X# X# Maybe I'll turn this into our first zsh script! X# X# Looks like it turned into a perl script at some point - big improvement. X############################################################################## X# This code tries to be intelligent in the way it works.  This means there X#  are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in. X#  These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use and in my X#  environment.  At the same time I try to make as few assumptions as possible X#  about the remote machine.  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones... X# *) That the remote machine has csh.  (Linux?) X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh.  (Make same.) X# *) If remote shell = sh that $PATH is compatible.  (Use csh etc..) X# *) I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be but does it X#    know what to do with a cookie. (eat it?) X# *) There must be others... X############################################################################## X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands?  Simply because it doesn't X#  interact badly with rsh and hang waiting for a file descriptor to X#  be closed.  I'd rather use zsh or bash or even perl but they are not X#  as universal as csh.

The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far it would be best to run as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11 window manager xterm etc.) and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal (where n ranges from 4 to 10 depending on who I talk to). What should I be looking for?  What sort of questions should I be asking the salespeople? Thanks Trevor J. Smedley - smedley@tuns.ca School of Computer Science Technical University of Nova Scotia"

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString. You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses as you like.

The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8 of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions) where there is about 10 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons. The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in Volume One  chapter 9.

"1","We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X X-designer Tele-Use tcl/tkInterviews and SUIT. So far I've drawn the following conclusions: 1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ? 10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.

"1","Hi I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment variables (like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc) in my .login file.  With xdm the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. I used the DisplayManager._0.userPath resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession but that didn't help.  I also tried using DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH which didn't work either.

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group I'll take the liberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to support@qdeck.com. A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like Smoking Clover would make the link useless for anyone else.  On the other hand probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes. Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis I wouldn't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people. >>Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding >>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of >>thing) you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before >>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). > >Hmmm.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server.  As I warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link. Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. If no backing store then what was being covered up?  If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls. > > >>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >>doing network things also...) >>-- > >What do you mean by network things?

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's pretty good for this.  X programs are best DOS text programs are almost as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid. We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell us. +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   | |         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\  | |  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\  | |   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\  | |          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\  | |    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\  | |     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\  | |         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+"

In the list you mentioned tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively it allows any font sizes but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing. Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told that it compiles under Linux but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with both color and monochrome X. -- Bill Cheng // UCLA Computer Science Department // (310) 645-8328 3564-C Boelter Hall // Los Angeles California 90024 // USA william@CS.UCLA.EDU      ...!{uunet|ucbvax}!cs.ucla.edu!william"
"1","Greetings We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image effectively turning them into xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays. When we had 3 xkernel machines things worked fine but when we installed 4 more last weekend we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2 the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged. Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the department chair it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server). Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? How about obvious gimmes? And of course any ideas on how to solve it? Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Greg Owen  { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu gowen@jade.tufts.edu } Systems Programmer and TA Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file instead of your login-only one which is fair enough if you only have a few users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do what the books tell them though then it's confusing at best.  Another is to have your xterms run login shells but that still leaves the window manager and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment. Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell and has *it* then run the rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set up as normal and inherited by everything.

In X10 the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests;  that is the server's drawing model was stateless. This caused problems with performance and network traffic so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization then pass the GC id in each drawing request. For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics."

Why did X designers decide to not associate |> the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the |> display it is being drawn on? For flexibility. Anyway what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext not with a display and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2 you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpywingc_redx1y1x2y2); XDrawLine(dpywingc_bluex3y3x4y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every drawing call so why do it for color ? BTW stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points) for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing where you pay some nominal fee get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets especially if you only one customer to distribute to.

"1","Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists --------------------------------------------- Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for SCO products in general. With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO newsgroups many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.* hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide. biz.sco.{opendesktopgeneralannounce} were newgrouped May 1 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within biz.  Given the content this change relocated the opendesktop newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new announce and general groups.  On Aug 1 1991 the former sco-list@uunet.uu.net became scogen in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions. biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1 1992 to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix UNIX and OpenDesktop specific binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are moderated with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups. Respecting USENET etiquite these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts. biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14 1992 to provide a discussion area for the readers writers and publishers of SCO Magazine. Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed you are now able to subscribe to the following: Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription ---------                    ------------------------- biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.sources			<none> biz.sco.binaries		<none> biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP as do many archive sites. If after having explored all options you are still unable to receive biz.sco.* as news you may subscribe to the mailing lists. The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email. Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate mailing list subscription address above including in the message body: Add: subscriber_address		-eg- Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or- Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled the same way simply substitute Delete: for Add: ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list subscribers receive how to post to the mlist article submission information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive an acknowledgement within a few days check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases it's likely that someone somewhere is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do the same with mailing list traffic) and you'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list subscriptions are free subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site(s) feeding you. Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site. What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable): biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past present and future implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating environment and it's various bundled components. biz.sco.general:     Questions answers and comments on SCO products in general and of course resulting discussions. biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of interest to current and future users of SCO products and to SCO developers resellers and distributors. (moderated followups directed to biz.sco.general). biz.sco.sources:	SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and utilities modified to compile and run with various incarnations of SCO Xenix UNIX and/or OpenDesktop. biz.sco.binaries:	Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source code often from source posted in biz.sco.sources and often installable using the SCO custom utility. biz.sco.magazine:	Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers writers and publishers. You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup.  For example posting your ODT question to the general newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public ODT archives.  Appropriate crossposting is allowed.

"1","We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. We typically have several of these running in windows plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o. Any suggestions or examples most welcome! We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems. Morris Hirsch aka morris@sg25.nusc.navy.mil or 401 841 7800"

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get to the root window.  Now this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window so be sure to take that into account for further calculations. Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION. Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window so the windows xywidthheight must be adjusted accordingly. All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using. Now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly). DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory and I no longer have the code.  But I did get it working under several window managers correctly.

"1","I have been using a HDS X-terminal and really like it. What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window manager. One can then run a special client X program called a window manager either (1) run motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc or vms). This is powerful especially since I can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other). Well the question is: On a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program?

"1","I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. However this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. After some research I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family Weight Slant and Pointsize.  I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts but not for the family I am using (Helvetica). I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font). The command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a resolution X appears to pick a stupid default. Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so why?  Is there anything I can do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about my resolution and specify a single font path (75 or 100 not both). This would at least make my app consistent but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: Yup thats an inch.  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

So use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!). And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets setting the visual and colormap resources rather than direct X routines so I could be wrong. But I think this is the general difficulty.

"1","Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice I would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course this would be circumventing the author's wishes on the subject but I'd say if you're not going to pay him no matter what you'd be on relatively safe ground with that approach...  In fact given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being a lawyer I can't be positive. Regardless the fees he's asking are not excessive and I would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing else. - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  If money can't buy happiness daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.

Special Notes: * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4 due to ship later this year. * Yes Sun is moving to Motif along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to which they move will be a new Motif with some of the OPEN LOOK UI features added. * Yes OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead. This means TNT is dead too. * XView and OLIT will be supported but probably not enhanced after the next release.  I don't know if there will be a source release of XView 3.1 or not. * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool at least. * Yes the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant. Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly.

Subject: Bibliography -- books manuals journals papers beer-mats Subject: Getting this File Revision History Recent Changes Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK OpenWindows X11 XView OLIT MOOLIT Motif @ What is OPEN LOOK? OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of windows buttons and scroll-bars how you resize things how you edit files etc. The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?). See Also: Bibliography @ What is OpenWindows? OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems. It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors. OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively. It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook' as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else. A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5000 for the server plus about $25000 for DeskSet and another $40000 for ToolTalk. The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1 See Also: Mixing X11 and OpenWindows Where can I get it? @ What are OLIT XView and TNT? These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary: OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system; it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a division of AT&T now owned by Novell) who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.). Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses. [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference] XView is Sun's toolkit for X11 written in C.  XView is similar in programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows. The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere). The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0. Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be included in the next release of OpenWindows unlike NeWS. On the other hand the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as OLIT. The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows. The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0 but Sun are committed to supporting the API at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail. You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing. Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT however. The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++ class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3 and presumably V3.0.1 since the release mentions that it works on Solaris 2. UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!). @ Where does Motif fit in? It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non- commercial Motif toolkits available although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a large installed base. Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable. @ What is MoOLIT? MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V Release 4.2. Contact: Joanne Newbauer jo@usl.com (908) 522-6677 @ What about that Display PostScript thing? Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use as I understand it.  The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller being generally less complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine. Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work; what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen. Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems the DPS extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard. (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available however) Subject: Window Managers -- olwm olvwm @ What are olwm and olvwm? They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen and for managing the user's interaction with the windows. Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager. It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations and you can also get the source by ftp since Sun donated it. Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it. Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib directory; there are three patches). @ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm? Yes.  If you use twm for example or mwm you won't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm and you (probably) won't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages. If you use twm you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run under olwm. For twm put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: LeftTitleButton target = f.delete where target is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. Alternatively try # Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton :menu = f.menu OL.menu menu OL.menu { Quit         f.delete } For mwm you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told). See the manual page for your window manager (twm etc). Subject: OpenWindows Terminals and Other Displays @ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal? The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView NeWS (PostScript) and X11. This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems. Unfortunately it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes pageview in particular. You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open- Windows display and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones) will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found.  If so see the Fonts section below. If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal you may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help. Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows @ What configuration files do I need to know about? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc The first time you run OpenWindows a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files. If your site uses xdm you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file. .openwin-init .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an X terminal you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C shelltool -C xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's contool program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen. Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc. .Xdefaults You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular it is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true *Input: TRUE These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. Props the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into .Xdefaults. Don't put comments in .Xdefaults since `props' deletes them. .startup.ps This is the NeWS user profile file read by OpenWindows (actually xnews) on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual near the back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient. WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3. Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see the man page for xset (man xset and xset -help) for more information. Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second (300000 microseconds) and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn't include the time to process each key which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again this is for OpenWindows 3... % don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual % /IncludeDemos? false def UserProfile begin /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly... end You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory like this: /NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage If you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the OpenWindows server like this: $ psh -i .startup.ps Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 /classinit ClassRepeatKeys send %%% now press control-D You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make the root window be retained so that a PostScript drawing on the background won't be erased when you move windows: frambuffer /Retained true put will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically. See also: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults? Environment Variables @ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard? You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises.  See also man 7 xview for a list of keybindings you can change at least for XView programs. With OpenWindows 2.0 you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this in your .xinitrc: if eval `svenv -env` then xmodmap -e pointer = 1 2 3 input_from_defaults else xmodmap -e pointer = 3 2 1 fi @ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle? Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'. Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system as it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system run screenblank automatically. Subject: Key Bindings Cut and Paste @ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs? To go from XTerm to textedit (say): * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button in xterm * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6 or Meta+c (the O'Reilly XView manual gets this wrong) * Move to the textedit window and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v) If this doesn't work see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste To go the other way from textedit to XTerm: * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button). * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons. @ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available? Quick Copy within textedit mailtool etc: * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined or crossed out as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey) * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button. * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret. Drag and Drop to Move a Selection * Select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple- clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon). * Still holding SELECT down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target to show that it's OK to drop things here * Let go of SELECT and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows. Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection except that you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button. @ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere? See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them. In general the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the right of the insert point. Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward) Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page. @ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented? See the manual page for shelltool. Subject: Applications: Finding Out... Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide which lists over 200 pages of applications and also the _huge_ Catalyst listing of products for Suns updated six-monthly. Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo and receive the full product documentation. SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users Printer's Pallate which contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters as well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license. There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a copy including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a faster reply. Subject: DeskSet Mailtool Calendar Manager etc. @ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)? Yes cm_delete cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages. If man cm_delete doesn't work or gives strange messages see under Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages below. @ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail? The best way is: $ cd $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc . $ chmod +w .textswrc edit .textswrc (use vi textedit or whatever you prefer) add the follwing: KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER cat ~/.signature (you might need to change ~ to $HOME) Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file. Subject: Fonts @ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts? Yes under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which). Or Not Yet in other words. If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them I'm told. The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted though and comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the Sun OpenFonts group listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts. You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS Monotype Linotype URW and probably other major foundries. SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts. @ Improving font rendering time Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast it's not as fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size. $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you currentfontmem =	% type this line ... 300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes 1024 setfontmem % Just to check: currentfontmem = 1024 See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page. @ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup: $ mkdir $HOME/myfonts $ cd $HOME/myfonts $ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b Creating Bembo20.afb $ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. $ ls Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list $ bldfamily * Bembo		       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin) cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory $ xset +fp `pwd` $ xset fp rehash If you want the server to see your new font directory every time add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one of your start-up files e.g. .login or .profile. @ Converting between font formats (convertfont etc.) You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server by converting them to a bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf. Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to X11 bdf format which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows. You can also use der Mouse's getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf @ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi There aren't any.  More precisely the various text fonts such as Lucida Typewriter Sans are available at 100 dpi and in fact are scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps and don't scale very well. Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages @ No manual entry for cm_lookup If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands even though you are running OpenWindows try setting the MANPATH environment variable: MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH or setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems. @ window: Window creation failed to get new fd @ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Cannot create base frame.  Process aborted. These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an earlier windowing system for Suns and was not networked.  Some of the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin and have names that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead. Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin they're the same) or you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool cmdtool shelltool etc. @ memory fault - core dumped If you get this from the binder or if binder vanishes suddenly get the following patches: 100493-02 Binder 100524-03 Cetables 100626-03 Tooltalk @ Trouble compiling Xt Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt) contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: 100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu If you can't install the patch a workaround is to add -u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add -assert nodefinitions to CFLAGS in your Makefile or even in Imake.tmpl. Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type @ When I try to type into some programs I just get beeps or nothing happens It is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true *Input: TRUE in your .Xdefaults file as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. See the next item for editing .Xdefaults Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working @ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs Under OpenWindows 2 you need to add the following either to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead: XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\ <Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing L8 (the Paste key)! Under OpenWindows 3 this is already in the app-defaults file so if it isn't working check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S and if it isn't either set it or copy/merge the above lines from $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.

Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started OpenWindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm. If not start it.  If it dies check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot your workstation. Check that there is space in /tmp (use df /tmp) and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out. Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm (calendar) start a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade so don't remove those without checking first!

If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you using your display you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost +`hostname` (or xhost +happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation). This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display. With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth and the Programmer's Guide describes how to do this in Chapter 8 p. 101.  This is more secure. Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly! Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem.

Have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets. Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems @ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4) If refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm -C from your .xinitrc or start one up in the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the Workspace->Utilities menu.  Better still pick up contool and run that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears; it's very easy to configure. If refresh from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages go away... a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto a whole new (but monochrome) display called :0.1.  See the man. page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and if there's a /dev/cgfour0 does openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2 you might need to add this to your .xinitrc or other startup file: ( eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` olvwm -display unix:0.1 ) & Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also see the note about contool above. @ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults? Use `props' which appears in the default root menu as `properties'. This starts `props' a property editor which will re-write your .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.

This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0 there are various ways including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3  probably the best you can do (short of upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool. @ Why don't flat check-boxes work? A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these. A workaround is to edit the Guide output as it's only Guide's output that's broken not the actual check-box code. This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're still using an ancient DevGuide you should upgrade as soon as possible; the new one is fantastic! @ When I leave OpenWindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen. Try running clear_colormap; if this helps put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin'). @ When I use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something. This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv 2.21 or xgrabsc. @ Why have some of my function keys stopped working? Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37 respectively in OpenWindows 3.

(see also next item) @ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows (see also next item) Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch level 18) but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to OpenWindows 2.0 although you could also the do same sort of thing with OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5. Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows and X11R4 or X11R5 they're all compatible in this respect. Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11. Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH so that you get OpenWindows versions of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate although this is a matter of preference.  In any event put the OpenWindows bin directory first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have /bin (or /usr/bin they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview you'll get SunView programs instead of OpenWindows ones! Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last after the X11 library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0 but with older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item) although xdm core dumps if this isn't right. Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't /usr/openwin. See Also: Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH). @ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11 use /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib If you put this in a shell script or your .profile use ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for /bin/sh; for csh it is different. @ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches and install the patch. @ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me? You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw the PostScript text and pictures. If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0 compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM. If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0 you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia!) The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2. Note that the data files are in PostScript so you can look at them with a PostSript viewer (q.v.). @ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb? A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z @ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu? It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties Key (L3) though or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it. @ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool Sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also works if you run command tool on a remote machine. Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2. @ When I run OLIT programs some of the widgets are red! Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus. To disable it in most places add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file: *traversalOn: off *TextEdit.traversalOn: on *TextField.traversalOn: on You can change the color using (for example) *InputFocusColor: grey50 *input*FocusColor: green *List*inputFocusColor: <your background color> See the man page resources(3w) at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation. Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30 the OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch. @ When I run several programs the colors on the screen all change when I move into a different window! (colormap flashing) This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time. However you can minimise the effect with the following procedure: *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve. *  Run cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file *  Put the line cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc) *  Exit and then restart the window system. *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them. Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window and Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page. @ pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash (see above): This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows. Try running pageview like this: $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono $OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard @ XDM breaks things Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'. Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well. SunView applications may need to be run with svenv as in svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables. Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root which is a security hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start Unix processes ass root... @ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working In OpenWindows 3.0 the X11 names (keysyms) for these keys was changed to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.	 Code which uses them should be recompiled or you might be able to get away with xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36' Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears which has been promised but hasn't reached here.	Note that there is also a usenet newsgroup alt.toolkits.xview although it doesn't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month.	You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x. @ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items? PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle. PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles. There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font. You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function insert_row(list row string) that hides the nasty bits. @ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed? In the button callback do xv_set(button PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS XV_ERROR NULL); This will keep the window visible. You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute. @ how do I make an XView button look pressed? call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source... @ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly Here is Greg Earle's patch to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2 for example).

This list is for OpenWindows 3.0 -- differences for OpenWindows 2.0 are marked and I've added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5 too. DISPLAY  The name of the X Windows Display to use :0.0 (on the local machine the one actually running X11 or xnews) :0.1 (on some machines for a second monochrome screen) machine-running-unix:0.0 (on other machines) (You may need to do xhost +other-machine to let programs on other machines use your display; see also under Trouble Shooting and see the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmer's Guide pp. 101ff) See also: console messages under Trouble Shooting FONTPATH  Where xnews searches for fonts /usr/openwin/lib/fonts (you can also use xset fp+ dir to add a directory to the font path but you may have to do xset fp rehash afterwards.  This is fine under OpenWindows but many X11 servers have font problems) HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key (or F1) /usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/openwin/lib/help (On SunOS 4.0.* or with OpenWindows 2.0 omit the first entry which is for sites using a local other than C or USA). LD_LIBRARY_PATH   Where to look to find shared C libraries /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/CC/`arch` (the /usr/CC/`arch`/lib entry is only needed if you use C++ programs) OPENWINHOME	 Where OpenWindows lives /usr/openwin KEYBOARD MOUSE -- serial devices to use instead of the console (don't set these for normal use; /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse) PATH  Where the Shell searches for programs to run $(OPENWINHOME)/bin:$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview:/usr/local/bin:.\ $HOME/bin.`arch`:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/hosts:\ (you will certainly want to change this example!  There is no $(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview in OpenWindows 3.0) XFILESEARCHPATH  Where programs look for app-defaults files /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S (This is set automatically by openwin in OpenWindows 3.0) You might want to use /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S or perhaps both separated with a : for example (for sh users) XFILESEARCHPATH=$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S export XFILESEARCHPATH If you use X11R5 you might instead want /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S: $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S (put all this on one line though with no spaces!) Together with the following in lib/Xinitrc xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB' *customization: END_XRDB xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB' #ifdef COLOR *customization:  -color #endif END_XRDB you automatically get a color oclock editres bitmap xcalc and xlogo since they use the *customization resource appearing as %C in the XFILESEARCHPATH. (see oclock (n)) according to Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>. Subject: Where Can I get It? Ftp implementations etc... XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and elsewhere. MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form. OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun or you can get the source from Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V Release 4 implementations although that's not always the latest version. The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0. Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS and it is also included as the windowing system for Solaris. There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either available now or in progress.  Unfortunately none of them seem to be available from anywhere.  Contact anthony@ovi.com for more information. Subject: Bibliography: books manuals journals papers beer-mats The OPEN LOOK (tm) Graphical Interface is documented in two books: Sun Microsystems Inc. `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Application Style Guidelines' Addison Wesley 1989 and Sun Microsystems Inc. `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Functional Specification' Addison Wesley The Main documentation for the X Window system comes from O'Reilly & Associates in about nine or ten volumes. The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are: Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year) Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller] [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0] Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte] The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual together with other reference information so that in practice you have to buy both books. O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between X11R4 and RX115. OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5. There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5. A journal The X Resource may also be of interest.

The System V Release 4 Documentation from Prentice Hall may also include a section on OpenWindows. David Miller describes programming with OLIT in his `An OPEN LOOK At Unix' (M&T press). Nabajyoti Brkakati gives an excellent introduction to X and to OLIT programming as well as setting up and using X and OpenWindows in: `Unix[R] Desktop Guide to OPEN LOOK' SAMS 1992  ISBN 0-672-30023-0 You can get the examples from this book as export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/naba-olguide-examples.tar.Z Also about using OLIT and Xt in particular: The X Window System: Programming and Applications with Xt OPEN LOOK Edition Doug Young and John Pew Prentice Hall 1992 ISBN 0-13-982992-X There are also HP Widgets and Motif (ugh) versions of this book. The example source code in this book can be obtained by ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/young.pew.olit.Z. There is an introduction to XView in `Writing Applications For Sun Systems' Vol 1 `A Guide for Macintosh(R) Programmers' (Sun Microsystems pub.

PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook Adobe Systems Inc. Addison Wesley 1985 [The blue book] There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS). Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper) and vary from about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's Guide' on the front.  The User manuals have a red stripe on the bottom and the Programmer ones have a green stripe. 800-6006-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Release Manual 800-6029-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Installation and Start-Up Guide 800-6231-10 OpenWindows Version 3 DeskSet Reference Guide 800-6618-10 OpenWindows Version 3 User's Guide 800-6323-10 Desktop Integration Guide [also available in bookstores?] 800-6027-10 Programmer's Guide 800-6005-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Reference Manual [the man pages] 800-6319-10 The NeWS Toolkit 3.0 Reference Manual 800-6736-10 NeWS 3.0 Programming Guide 800-6055-10 OLIT 3.0 Widget Set Reference Manual 800-6198-10 XView 3.0 Reference Manual: Converting SunView Applications 800-6854-10 F3 Font Format Specification [order separately] There are also some other sets of documentation including the TypeScaler documentation from the OpenFonts group for example.

AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT. Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7 though). Volume 8 of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration and mentions OpenWindows although it is primarily aimed at X11R5. Several other books are in the works...

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  IMHO it contains a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated. If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired you can retrieve this FAQ from an archive site. There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about them and how to access them please see the Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. I don't think it's stock MIT but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially. Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock Xterm Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients etc).  If you use more than one then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.

Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below. If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z ...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog!  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it.

I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw etc) - These take up RAM and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu mouse settings { Mouse Settings:			f.title   Very Fast				! xset m 7 10 &   Normal (Fast)			! xset m 3 10 &   System Default (Un-Accelerated)	! xset m default &   Glacial				! xset m 0 10 & } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out: - For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions corrections or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

"1","Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window and I want it to have some background color say red and draw an oval in it. Further when I resize the window I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000. My problem is this: when I resize the window only the original part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. For example I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400 the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window? Second question: Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are??? Thanks Chris"

"1","Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already  and can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is: Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the data  is  arriving  over a slow link or the $DISPLAY is across a slow link) they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the picture  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution with each  4x4  square  of pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be painted. Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a small  bitmap  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X server  can help.  That is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process (Permission denied ;-) and have it open a local window? It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up such  a  program  remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to  expand. But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help it's be nice to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs  but  if  it's  there  I obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy. Oh yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build demos  that  can  show such things as If this were run across say a 4800-bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear.  Then  the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for. -- If the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would  now cost $5 would get 5000 miles to the gallon and at random times would explode killing all its passengers."

Ghostview is a postscript previewer that uses ghostscript. From the ghostview README: Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript. Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4. Brief list of features: - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions. - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures. - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our European friends. - Scrollbars appear when necessary. - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait Landscape Upside-down and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction). - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale or color on a Color monitor.) - Ability to mark pages for printing or saving.  (Good for people that printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.) - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution (1 display dot = 1 printer dot). The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people are encouraged to use in other programs. Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z From the ghostscript README: ***************************************************** * This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. * ***************************************************** ******** ******** An overview of Ghostscript ******** ******** Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language which very closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the Ghostscript language. The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely in C with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms. Currently Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform families: - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA VGA SuperVGA or compatible graphics under MS-DOS 3.1 3.3 or 5.0; - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11 release 3 4 and 5 including Sun-3 Sun-4 Sun-386i Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix; H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2; Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo; - Sun workstations (Sun-3 SPARC Sun-386i) running SunView; - VAX VMS with X11R3/4/5 gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler version 3.1 or later is required).

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course I'm biased...) DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers that uses a standard X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol allowing you to display them or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display on the net). Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform; many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications. (Often you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you already own all the clone equipment then there are lots of such programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine). *BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone. (From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better. In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM ethernet card very high performance graphics card GOOD monitor server software TCP/IP for clone software mouse keyboard etc etc etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$). I can get 15 Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900 and the performance is over 80000 Xstones..... -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | Mark A.

"1","I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+ under OpenWindows 3.0. The application uses XView stuff to create my window and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the Canvas. The application does real-time 2-D animation but it does not update the the display fast enough. I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my update routine and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also it appears to be compute bound because if I run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even more. Any ideas ? Thanks."
"1","I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to include in a manual. I have tried: xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd from a login on a remote terminal but it doesn't work. Xwd seems to wait for the window server but the window server doesn't answer. Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen.

"1","Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System ------------------- If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style like this... // mini sample application ///////////////////////////////////// class Test : public XmWindow { void cmd(char*); void quit(void*); public: Test() : XmWindow(Xm++ Test Window) {} void initialize(); }; void Test::initialize() { XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu(); menu->addLabel(&File); menu->addItems( Entry(Menu Item &One CB(Test::cmd)) Entry(Menu Item &Two CB(Test::cmd)) NULLENTRY); menu->addSeparator(); menu->addItem(	Entry(E&xit CB(Test::quit))); addSubpane(Edit myEdit); edit(myEdit)->setText(Hello World.); } void Test::cmd(char* n) { edit(myEdit)->setText(n); } void Test::quit(void*) { exit(0); } void XmApp::initialize() { (new Test)->initialize(); } /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README): Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11 and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows) but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-). Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows' 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution) Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText' 'staticImage' 'pushButton' 'checkBox' 'radioButton' 'edit' 'listBox' 'comboBox' 'groupBox' 'paneArea' 'drawing' 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects. CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991) an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound alternative input devices). If you are interrested look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines rectangles circles...) but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an object) this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. About this first release: Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications. Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on: HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07 SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1 PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6 Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

If you don't do this the >cursor will be hard to track when in motion. You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors smaller block cursors) turn on and off blinking set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok enough advertising. I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text) I'd say it won't be easy since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10). The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped. As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version. As is emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else than a csh. There is a fix to this which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

"1","Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion... Color Coordination... I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no one responded at all. The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table devotes itself solely the window manager icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working. ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers Animation Real Time video Raytracers etc... . The following is a suggested color table for icons and general use. Icons Window Managers and general applications should follow this table or something like it UNLESS the application is ``color needful''. * for each primary color (redgreenblue) three colors EG: values   0 128 and 255. This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons. * two extra shades of grey EG: vales    (black) 0 64 128 196 and 255 (whitered...) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager. This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the workstation.

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another. This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used. 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual) Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands. xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge - This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire program also uses a variation however I wrap it as part of the remote command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth) Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required. The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also pass environment variables as well as the current directory.  You will however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories. WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended. The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from the view of other users. 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable. This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly. A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the actual call to rlogin is performed to include your DISPLAY and your authorization. On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or stty'ing your terminal. ---8<--- script for launching rlogin: #!/bin/sh # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display: if [ -n $DISPLAY ]; then case $DISPLAY in :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;; esac TERM=$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY` export TERM fi rlogin $* ---8<--- add to your .cshrc or .login if ( $?TERM ) then if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge - setenv DISPLAY `echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f2` setenv TERM    `echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f1` endif endif ---8<--- xterm command to use xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname ---8<--- 3/ NFS. Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to. Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted then authorization is automatically passed Hoever you will still have to pass your DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE: login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host` 4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information. This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known by others nor should it be easy to determine. A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone who is asking. This last method was developed last year by a second year here untill I explained to him the need for the encryption at which point he gave up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but less secure.

"1","This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking: I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0 which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen. My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1 even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions: static Bool next_savescreen(scron) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; { /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */ if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { nextSetLastEventTime(); } if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */ next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle); NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle 0.0); /* Blank the screen */ } else {											 /* Unblank the screen */ NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle next_save_screen_brightness); } return TRUE; } I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver but I cannot find where it wakes up the server and unblanks the screen.

"1","Hi I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events so that when the program exits I can save the last known geometry in some sort of 'preferences' file. I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell: XtAddEventHandler(topLevelStructureNotifyMaskFalseconfigureCBmyData); This works fine and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). However when I'm just resizing the window using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure structure like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct. When I reposition the window using the window manager the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x y width height member settings. Q1: Anybody know why when just resizing the x and y are being set to zero? Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x y width height resources.

This means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 You can ask for the follwogin: -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you.

I want to connect this to a widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards. But because the drawing takes some while I want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted.

I looked >twice at porting emu to linux but stopped short becuse of the tty >part. Is there a `cleaner' version of emu that supports POSIX tty >explicitly? Hmm depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for call it operating system types then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a OS flavor yet that is fully POSIX we haven't gotten around to really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times this only uses up some disk space since only the drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into emu. It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff but unfortunately I don't have a linux system available to me so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or questions contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu since we just don't have access to that many different systems.

In xvttool simply create a key file that looks like: a	A b	B c	C ... and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate any input into any other (in my case lo-case to up-case).  Works great and you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side. To use an xterm solution add to your .Xdefaults: capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>a: string(A)\n\ ... or: capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\ <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\ <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\ ... and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm Thanks loads! -- Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov"

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt). You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this is the hard part).  Then in the callback that starts the drawing you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean... TRUE when you are finished and FALSE when you want to keep processing.  If you return FALSE the workProc is automatically re-installed. Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop since events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you are using the same Ada bindings I am however you are hosed and should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt). ---------- Joe Hildebrand hildjj@fuentez.com Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts (703)273-1447 Standard disclaimers apply"

"1","Hi netters: We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h: #if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__) #       include <string.h> #       define  index   strchr #       define  rindex  strrchr #else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */ #       include <strings.h> #endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's distribution) mentions this problem: BUGS If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  Berkeley  C preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all #if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have its own parser written for #if expressions. Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

Asher Yes Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what folks can purchase today and you have a complete show focused on X11. Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: Bob Schiefler Lu Abel Mark Ackerman Paul Asente Doug Blewett Donna Converse Jim Fulton Oliver Jones Keith Packard Ralph Swick Doug Young and many others. Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational; and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT. With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing applications for in-house or custom use a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT so must their developers and suppliers. The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment this is the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft get them to show you what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself. I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a confusing place at the moment with UNIX COSE NT DCE CORBA and all of the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion. -Aub Harden Technical Program Manager harden@ics.com X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade ******    *****    Show for Corporate *      *       *    Software Development ******     *** *         *    201 Broadway ***     *****     Cambridge MA  02139 Windows on Distributed Computing June 7 - 11   San Jose CA xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555 Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions Inc."

What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]? In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols notably to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling -Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic appears to work.

"1","Hi I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1). Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays I need different values for the same resource so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files. However cpp is only invoked by xrdb and not when the resources are loaded on demand. Is there a proper solution to this? So far the only proper solution I've come to think of is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/ say XTerm and XTerm-color and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color. But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH). Furthermore I thought of using #include XTerm in XTerm-color. However for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color things are different on both machines. On a Sun the FIRST found resource is used (i.e. the one from XTerm the b&w one) while on an RS/6000 the LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do about it? I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH I can use %T %N %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults %N for the resource class but what do %C and %S stand for?

I wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it. I've done this fine but I've turned up the following problem: When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of the above events but when they are not sensitive I only get callbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing. Is this a bug?  If not can someone explain this behavior? thanks Mark"

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be >a problem but a couple dozen should be fine. Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem except over a wet string network. One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process and does not add any transactions it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase in overhead especially as the application may have quite a large working set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor there could be as many as 50. If you want to go there I wouldn't start from here! Nick Maclaren University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory New Museums Site Pembroke Street Cambridge CB2 3QG England.

Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself: o Complete on-line context sensitive help system. o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript. o Rotated Text support! o Source code for the demo is provided. The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9). There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory: Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x) HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9) If you have any questions about the demo send an e-mail to: support@bristol.com. If you want another version of the demo (rs6000etc...) please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com. Remember to use binary mode! What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter. HyperHelp 3.0 ------------- HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one line function call application developers can access the full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF project and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility. This allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between MS Windows Motif and Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler! New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windowsa character based viewer segmented bitmaps SGML support and an improved History window. Xprinter 2.0 ------------ Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new X based applications very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for our demo and see Xprinter in action. If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support to your application Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for UNIX SVR4.2. Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about HyperHelp and Xprinter. If you have any questions or comments send them to us at: info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

Mario Lemieux is the explanation IMHO. >You could make a case that the *expectation* of an improving team that >would make the playoffs is the reason. Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make. >But I think the reason is Lemieux >had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and >Ross since 1980.  People turned out to watch him play. I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team sucks. But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them.  If they suddenly dropped to say 50 points you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon. >Also the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. >They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is >true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing >this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team. >A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An >increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival >of Mario Lemieux is what did it. You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started... It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it gee Mario Lemieux is amazing I'll go watch him play or was it gee now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side I'll go watch him play.  I think it was the latter. > Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before >Gretzky's arrival about 12000 per game.  After constant sellouts.  They >are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement >since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going >to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner they haven't >GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than >they currently have yet they didn't draw as well then. I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell but people don't go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points same source) and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much. Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-).  Anyway  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc.  But as I said when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold. >I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky the player can transcend >winning as the major drawing power. For the short term IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky simply because they make people around them better. >But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-) Well at least we are in full agreement here! >This does not make Roger's point any more valid but the Jets aren't So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...> >getting a HUGE jump in productivity yet they ARE getting a huge >jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne. >They have the 17th best record in hockey it sure as hell isn't because >they are winning. Yes but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without Selanne. I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If that's the case then fair enough but if it isn't the case then I'm curious to hear your explanation."

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne on the ice can be blamed on him...Roger he is a FORWARD.  Winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway.

"2","I can only comment on the Kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But at best he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that the award goes to Robert Lang an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel. Jon"

"2","Well I gotta tell ya last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an off-night for the Leafs and the Devils were outplaying Toronto. Well I BEG to differ.... IMHO Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour). I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? Well first look at their injury list which includes Cullen Ellet Zezel Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well so far?? Second just look at their standings still second in defence moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month haven't lost at home in last 12 games 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't remember him having any as of yet.) Well as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?) Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!

"2","Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now in fact.  My question is since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value or what?  Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet with no chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin what's the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no one knows I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).

Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support >them.  If they suddenly dropped to say 50 points you'd have knee surgery >for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon. I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and notably the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer the very fans the NHL wants to attract that these players are indeed superstars. >>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is >>true.

MVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and in terms of leadership (can't win without him) Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth (includes those players who at the outset of the season may not even have been in the team's plans).

However I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson who has had a brutal year his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding. As for biggest surprise I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his breakthrough year (for him) last year so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year. As for biggest disappointment you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls Gilchrist Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson but Mellanby isn't far off. -- Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253 During the Roman Era 28 was considered old..."

It turns out that the mask is custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then a plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside hardening the exterior fitting the cage etc. etc. John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. >He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on namely a >new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current >mask with the bear on it and new mask for Bob Essensa which was >*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin and there were two >fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed >back-ground.

"2","TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia Phillie will send Eric Lindros to Ottawa and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal. If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary? Personally I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything. They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in Phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the franchise. Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montreal for the pick. Stephen Legge SLEGGE@kean.ucs.munc.ca"

"2","Ten years ago the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats: Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100 Please note that these numbers are rounded off and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun. Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and Borshevshky. Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto Detriot Quebec and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well. I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the Russian Rocket I will completely throw up. As it is now every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-). Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This European mystique is sickening but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league. With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly only getting worse. I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent. I just don't want them on mine. -- Richard J.

"2","I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors. Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1. LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game. Coach Walsh of Maine replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow who won the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period like the second belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery the tournament MVP and all assisted by Paul Kariya. The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game. This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one month.

I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several crucial markets like Germany Italy and France while Sweden and Finland probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way American/Canadian fans do. Call it the Minnesota North Stars effect: Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea though.

Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise. Re Eric: True but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be like without Recchi for 30 games. Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time. Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise. My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school. pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner"
"2","The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack. Injuries: Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh. Roster Moves: Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old 6'4 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well. Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game flew to Albany got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win and played again for Hershey Sunday night. Lines: Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom in goal. Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period. Game Summary: If the FLYERS played like this every night they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do. Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal but Puppa made a great save reading the play. Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound. After the power play the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10. The FLYERS kept the pressure on and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards and Mike Mister McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill. With time running out in the period Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period. The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points. Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4 although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net but Soderstrom stoned him. The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS. The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little. The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play. At about the 12 minute mark Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout. Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown Recchi got the initial minor Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski and started throwing punches. Upward. Well Al held his own much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game Clark Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49. So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39. That was all the fireworks Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied with. Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end. FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500) so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80). Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils the Pens twice the FLYERS and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

"2","Well here it is NHL in the year 2000. I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the league has already started to move to this direction. *The Walt Disney Conference* Anaheim Mighty Chipmunks    -Franchise name to be changed after each new LA Kings                      hockey movie LA Flames                   -We've seen some of that San Jose Sharks San Diego Bruins Tijuana Red Wings   -Detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry... Dallas Stars Houston Oilers Texas Rangers Seattle Canucks *The Norm Green Conference* Alabama White Hawks Biloxi Blues Tampa Bay Lightning Miami Blades Helsinki Jets        -You've heard them starting getting used to the anthem Montreal Quebecois (sp?)                 -There will be no 'Canada' Atlanta Devils Orlando Penquins Key West Islanders Hartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move huh? Palm Beach Capitals Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe the rest of the 'message'.  I'm sure the future will turn you into believers too.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards ! I hope I'm just out of my mind.

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary supplier of players...Sweden Finland the Czech Republic and Slovakia are all relatively small countries and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two to recover and become a real threat and the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future. Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring unlike hockey. >    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the >Russian Rocket I will completely throw up.

I've been watching & playing hockey for a good long time now and I've seen players with questionable tactics but never have I seen what Ray did on Sunday. This guy gets my all time loser award. It's one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck when they are down it's another thing to have a fist fight with someones balls. Ray should be thrown out of the league what an a**hole. -Steve"

Jere Lehtinen from Kiekko-Espoo! There are also some rumours about Erik Kakko (Reipas) and Marko Jantunen (KalPa) being traded to TPS. Both of this players are currently on the Finnish olympic team. I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL too. BTW. Is Juha Yl|nen (centre HPK) drafted by the Jets?? During last year he has reached the top level among Finnish centres.

A couple seconds later the screen went completely black with an error message in large Bubble letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering I am a computer programmer and I had never seen an error like this on an actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or Intellevision years ago). Oh yeah after the message there was also what must have been an address in hexadecimal. I forget the exact hex code that was given. HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE??? It must have my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this. Thanks Randy PSC r_turgeo@oz.plymouth.edu"

Maybe we should look at baseball the supposed American pasttime (sp?).  Look at all the damn Latin Americans playing there!  They should all be deported! They aren't American!  (add sarcasm to taste) To Roger:  Wow for once we agree.  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.... I'll become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the Leafs being the best in the Campbell.  ;-) On the Rangers:  I told someone that nothing that happened in the Patrick would surprise me anymore.  I lied.  How the hell can a team go into Washington earn a shutout then come back home and lose to pitiful Hartford?  The absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity.  I can't stand it. From what I've read the goalie is to blame this time as Beezer played pretty poorly.  Smith is talking about calling up Corey Hirsch from Binghamton everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the same team which wanted to prove itself in Washington.  *Now* nothing that happens in the Patrick will surprise me.

I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but it's obviously easier to score in basketball there are more opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points that's at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is probably around 40 and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with. Also later in the post you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was that play was stopped too often. Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game? Matt att UVA"

How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the names of the players in order to determine who drew the foul!  And of course there will have to be new sub-positions like the power center who just sits in the slot until the (blue of course) puck comes near him and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman.  Finally we'll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled we'll be able to see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy. ;-) ;-) ;-) -- Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP but Kypreos (17 goals 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value. Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson Poulin Nylander and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake like Sanderson started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side. Biggest disappointment: Hands down John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face (appropriate since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson) and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all his 4 year $4M contract had three years left to run so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd also subpar after signing a 3 year $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich who showed flashes of competence but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row. -SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder) -steveg@cadkey.com"

In most cases the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk Russia if the GM believes him to be the better player the GM should be drafting him. Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers. Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions in most cases would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL the ECHL or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe. Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe? I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player) When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these: - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year. I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more: - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal. Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London Spain etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?) I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe. Myself I would like to see some European teams but what would be the best way to do it? Marc"

This inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding. If you get two you are thrown out of the game and fined. 3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref by player or coach. Penalty shot is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game. Besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 5 penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured. This works well for several reasons. First penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right? So it follows that the more the better. Next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial. Finally with only three penalties the network announcers (Don Meredith Dick Vitale John Madden Pat Summerall and Marv Levy among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it. Oh one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period) the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then once the PA announcer has told them who scored the TV announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right. Seriously though I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average maybe less. The game is 48 minutes with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime and it still takes over 2 hours. The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV basketball is fairly entertaining IMHO. But it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following then it truly is a sad day. Enough for now. dvb"

Boston Bruins Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19000-seat $160 million project back on track to be finished in September 1995. Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. ** Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League. Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825) Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike Ramsey. ** Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame Sunday April 11.  Darling who joined the expansion Sabres in 1970 was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. ** Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of American Hockey League. Calgary Flames Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future considerations. ** Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt Lake City of International Hockey League. Chicago Blackhawks The $175 million privately financed United Center scheduled to open in August 1994 will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility located directly across the street opens. Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report following a trade with Edmonton. Detroit Red Wings Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft pick. Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick their 13th pick in the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. ** Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit site of the Michigan Hall of Fame. Edmonton Oilers Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug Weight. Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no money from parking concessions or building advertising. The 17313-seat Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce significant revenues for other owners. Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the remainder of the season with a separated shoulder. Hartford Whalers Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick. Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. ** The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford Whalers franchise in the city.

A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic Green's former executive assistant claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics described her outfits as very hot and very sexy once slapped her hand as she was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it through a client's hair. The Minnesota North Stars who will move to Dallas after this season announced that nearly 11000 season ticket reservations have been made for their new home at Reunion Arena which has a capacity of 16800. The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must pay unpaid interest of $4492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992 which was made earlier this month and has been instructed not to take property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine. ** Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday April 11.  But the league didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo Mich. to replace Churla. Montreal Canadiens Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations. New Jersey Devils ** Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis Morel after the Devils' 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.

New York Islanders Traded right wing Daniel Marois to Boston for a conditional draft choice. New York Rangers Obtained forward Esa Tikkanen from Edmonton for center Doug Weight. Acquired left winger Mike Hartman from Tampa Bay Acquired center John McIntyre from Los Angeles for defenseman Mark Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick.

Leetch suffered the broken ankle March 19 following a victory over San Jose. The team said he slipped on an icy patch of pavement as he was getting out of a taxi cab in front of his apartment. ** Announced that defenseman James Patrick will require surgery on a herniated disc in his back and will not play again this season. ** Returned goaltender Corey Hirsch to Binghamton of the American Hockey League. Ottawa Senators The Ottawa Senators received the go-ahead to build the 18500-seat Palladium on the proposed location in nearby Kanata Ont.  The projected cost is C$150 million. Construction will be postponed until the 1995-96 season one year behind schedule. The Ottawa Senators lost their 37th consecutive NHL road game to tie the 1974-75 Washington Capitals for most road losses in a row. ** Assigned left wing Martin St. Amour to New Haven of the American Hockey League.

Quebec Nordiques 1-800-463-3333 St. Louis Blues St. Louis Blues center Ron Sutter will miss the rest of the season as a result of separating his right shoulder. San Jose Sharks The San Jose Sharks announced that ticket prices will increase by about 30% for the 1993-94 season when they move from the Cow Palace into a new $155-million arena in San Jose. ** Recalled defenseman Tom Pederson from Kansas City of the International Hockey League. ** Reached agreement in principle with left wing Alexander Cherbayev. Tampa Bay Lightning 1-800-881-2639 At least two investor groups are poised to build a sports arena in downtown Tampa if the delay-plagued company that holds a lease from the Tampa Bay Lightning bows out. Tampa Coliseum Inc. has a lease with the National Hockey League team to develop an entertainment and sports arena next to Tampa Stadium but has been unable to raise enough money for the project. Sent left winger Mike Hartman to the New York Rangers for center Randy Gilhen. Sent defenseman Peter Taglianetti to Pittsburgh for a third-round 1993 draft choice. Sent defenseman Rob Ramage to the Montreal Canadiens for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations. ** Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume the first female to play professional hockey stopped 25 shots and gave up six goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night April 10. After the game her coach Gene Ubriaco said Rheaume performed well enough to compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning. ** As their first season comes to a close there are rumors swirling that the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors according to Lightning general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday April 11 that the Lightning who have been playing in 10400-seat Expo Hall are exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  We were disappointed with ESPN's irresponsible comment Esposito said.  There is just no substance to the rumor. Rumors have been swirling for the past two years regarding a move by Tampa Bay which is presently discussing plans to build a new arena. Toronto Maple Leafs ** Defenseman Matt Martin who helped Maine win the 1993 NCAA hockey championship gave up his final year of eligibility and signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Western Conference teams will play six games against each of five divisional opponents (30); four games against each of the six teams in the conference's other division (24) and two games against each of the 14 Eastern Conference clubs (28). Playoffs: The system will be conference-based with the No. 1 team meeting the No. 8 team in the first round No. 2 vs. No. 7 No. 3 vs. No. 6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases the team with the most regular-season points will choose whether to start the series at home or away. ----- - Draft news: Under terms of the new expansion draft which will be held in June each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one goaltender five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction between forwards and defensemen. First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft which is down from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose Tampa Bay and Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros. Each of the 24 teams will lose two players with a maximum loss of one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman. At the end of the first phase of the draft the two new franchises will have three goaltenders eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose Tampa Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two new teams. Ottawa Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions. The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry Draft regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 1994. The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston but a delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved. ----- - League news: Disputes: The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary arbitration procedures clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

It will be staged in Ontario but the exact location won't be determined until next spring. In March of '93 the two regular-season division champions from the Ontario Hockey League will meet in a best-of-seven series at the start of the playoff season.  The winner of the series earns the right to host the Memorial Cup traditionally held in May. The eventual OHL champion will also participate in the tourney. But if the league champs also happen to be the club hosting the Memorial Cup then the league finalists will advance as well.

Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe former president of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations. According to Boe the league will debut with six to eight teams playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have been received from groups in Chicago Cleveland Dallas Denver Detroit Houston Minneapolis-St. Paul Phoenix San Francisco Saskatoon Toronto and Worcester Mass. Boe said. Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its rosters Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.'' Boe said league play will have an international flair and discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the IIHF. ``We're removing the red line moving the goal nets forward and eliminating all tie games'' said Boe.

Answers to some frequently asked questions: Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs? A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in and around Montreal. Hence they were called Les Habitants (natives of Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs. Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it? A: In 1914-15 the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year CAC no longer existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey. Q: What is the most informative hockey publication? A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe) Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in the NHL? A: If X goals are scored then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 chances. Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL? A: First +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal when a goal is scored each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a + and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-. Q: What is the five-hole? A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: (1) upper left corner of goal (2) upper right (3) lower left (4) lower right and (5) five-hole. Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice? A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a game an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice. Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game? A: Manon Rheaume a 20-year-old goaltender became the first woman ever to play in an NHL game on September 23 1992 when she started in net for the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8223 at the 10400-seat Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine shots. She left with the score tied 2-2 although the Lightning ultimately lost the game 6-4. Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history? A: Mario Lemieux the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins signed the richest contract in NHL history a seven-year deal believed to be worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 million a year nearly twice as much as any other player in the league. Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL? A: Gary Bettman vice president and general counsel of the National Basketball Association was named commissioner of the National Hockey League Friday December 11 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in September of 1984. A New York resident Bettman graduated from Cornell University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977. Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?

"2","After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible) I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good. How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore. Oh the playoffs should be fun Ralph"

Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the league.

I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :) As for Mariusz Czerkawski he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby) so he will play in Elitserien next season unless the B's can get him of course. I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this season.

"2","Well the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday the will meet the Caps in the playoffs. However I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all with the Islanders back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers one may think that the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway the games was pretty wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played a golie in is 1st NHL start I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this? Also I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such enforcers?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit I do enjoy a good fight once in a while but only when it's called for.  You know when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you don't deserve to win in the first place.

As Daryl points out Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's playoffs since the World Championships starts April 18th. But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next season. MoDo though naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg and Naslund so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind of money they would receive in NHL.

Actually Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team although in a late stage of the tournament. Technically I seem to recall that you can leave spots open until 24 hrs before the WC final.

These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone especially on the powerplay. Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone maybe pass to the point get it back skate some more pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??! Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la` Neely Shanahan Tocchet etc etc.  Too bad Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent IMO. Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time and he didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The third goal was EN. No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen. dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca"

They are very strong IMO and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose though I'd have to take the Penguins. A side note.  Vlad last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames either btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge) Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL. dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca"

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds. The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round. Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams but I prefer the divisional playoff. Gerald"

That Pens streak is a PLAYOFF streak (tied by the Chicago Blackhawks who had won 11 in a row until they met the Pens in the finals last year)  The 18 game unbeaten so far is a regular season unbeaten streak.  But hey don't take it personally.  I'm a Flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch.  But with a healthy Lindros Recchi Brind'amour and Tommy Soderstrom they'll be there next year! By the way since the Flyers need defenseman what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that Terry Carkner won't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook paper would be better defense. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Matt Weaver (properly found at AJS147@psuvm.psu.edu).

"2","Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs. Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while Chicago sweeps st.louis. That just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting none. For the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the Hawks again. Then bring pitt. and sure the Hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go. brian"

Nice try Deepak but tough Whaler squad should have clued you in to the fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek. If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest who have been playing with injuries who miss their families or who like Grant Fuhr would really rather be playing golf don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes. With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose which is to make a decent living. Of course the coach is a professional as well and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players.  So if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort. The second season is after all merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot.  The emphasis on the playoffs with their sudden death appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh loses the playoffs we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year.  They proved it. cordially as always rm -- Roger Maynard maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca"

Given the lack of respect he commands though I doubt he will win it.  The other reason concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.

"2","1st round: ---------- PITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4. It looks like a safe bet.  NYI has been bagging it of late. NYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour of Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4. WASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with WASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6. BOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last two weeks.  The only question is how long will it last? Fuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4. QUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7. It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry. The Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5. CHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. STL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4. DET  vs TOR:  DET in 6. I am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs offense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they turn it around against Detroit.  As I recall the last couple of time these two teams met the Leafs were pummelled. I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is DET in 5.  If not DET in 6. VAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6. Upset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry. There is something gone foul among Linden Momesso and Bure. WIN in 6. CAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5. Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does not watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols. CAL in 4. 2nd round: ---------- PITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their saving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place. However if PIGS have a quick first round they may be a little too high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that I will say PITT in 6. BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6. MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great. The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the B's.  B's in 6. CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7. Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine of late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played like killers.  DET in 6. WIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5. CAL has a solid team a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out muscle WIN.  CAL in 5. 3rd round: ---------- PITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may be something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7. CHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. Finals: ------ PITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. NO no no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say here.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will go with goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7. -jake."

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored- not to score them.

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man advantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated because their point totals are inflated by power play points. +/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck. Given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can inflate his totals. Gregmeister"

"2","Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday April 11.  But the league didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo Mich. to replace Churla. The above is courtesy of The Washington Times on-line service. Now here's where I need help.  If anyone out there has a tape of Tuesday's Chicago-Minnesota game please contact me.  Terms will be favorable. Also if anyone can tape tonight's Minnesota-Detroit game please contact me.  This could be quite important.  Once again I will make it worth your trouble.

Butcher will pound Roenick and The warthawks have no one tough enough to prevent it Bye Bye Wart HAwks"
"2","Smythe Division --------------- Vancouver vs. Winnipeg - Jets in 7 The Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games.  Everyone is healthy for the Jets.  I'm biased.  :) Calgary vs. Los Angeles - Flames in 6 From what I have seen the Kings have looked flat lately.  I just can't see them getting by the Flames. Final- Jets in 6. The Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will but it will be a close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.  I don't think he'll be 100% and while it will help it won't be enough. Norris Division --------------- Chicago vs. St. Louis/Minnesota Chicago in 6 against the Blues 7 against the Stars. Detroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6. The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae is more experienced than Potvin. Final - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it. Belfour is better than Chelvadae IMHO. Conference Final - Hawks in 6.  It hurts but the Hawks are more experienced and that will carry them through to the final. Prince of Wales Conference -------------------------- Adams Division -------------- Boston vs. Buffalo - Bruins in 6. B's can check Juneau is darn good and Neely.  The Sabres rely too much on Lafontaine and Mogilny. Quebec vs. Montreal - Montreal in 7. Classic battle the inexperience will hurt the Nords this year. Final - Bruins in 5.  Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords and Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs. Patrick Division ---------------- Pittsburgh vs Islanders/Devils - Pens in 5. One word.  Mario. Washington vs. Devils/Islanders - Caps in 6 / Devils in 7. I think the Caps can beat the Isles but not the Devils.  Tabaracci has been strong in goal and if he plays like last year he could carry the team. It doesn't matter though. Final - Pens in 5.  Two more words.  Stevens.  Jagr. Cup Final - Pens in 6.  Three last words.  Tocchet.  Murphy.  Barrasso. The only thing I don't like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to be out in full force again.  (I don't mean the regular Penguin fans...it's just like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post like nuts while the Jets are winning but we won't hear from again when they lose.)

Grant Fuhr Essa >Tikkannen Butch Goring Bob Nystrom Bob Gainey Doug Jarvis Derek >Sanderson Wayne Cashman Bob Baun Bob Pulford Ralph Backstrom Henri >Richard Dick Duff...and so on... These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players. They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL. As a defensive forward there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever. Gregmeister"

Since Hartford is pitiful the Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great the Isles will most likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting.  To Greg: yes I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?

"2","The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season. Roster move: Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill Injuries: Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched. Lines: Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary: I didn't get TV coverage of the game and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up: First Period: Hartford Nylander 10 8:51 Philadelphia Recchi 53 (Lindros Brind'Amour) 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek Har (holding) :55; Carkner Phi (roughing) 13:53; Houda Har (interference) 18:43 Second Period: Hartford Burt 6 (Cunneyworth Kron) 2:00 Philadelphia Bowen 1 (Eklund Recchi) 7:09 Hartford Nylander 11 (Zalapski Sanderson) 9:38 Penalties - Galley Phi major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek Har major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Brown Phi (tripping) 3:22; Zalapski Har (tripping) 15:51; Brind'Amour Phi (slashing) 19:50 Third Period: Hartford Kron 14 (Sanderson Cassels) 1:24 (pp) Philadelphia Beranek 15 (Lomakin Yushkevich) 3:11 Philadelphia Faust 2 (Brind'Amour Roussel) 3:38 Penalties - Houda Har (tripping) 4:20; Hawgood Phi (holding) 5:30 Overtime: Philadelphia Yushkevich 5 (Faust) 1:15. Penalties - None Power Play: Philadelphia 1 of 4 Hartford 1 of 4 Goalies: Philadelphia Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) Hartford Lenarduzzi 1-1-1 (38 - 33) On the first Hartford goal Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off. The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros. The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie. On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner Galley and McGill are all terrible about this I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play. That's all I have my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how. From what I heard Roussel had a very strong game. After the game Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play) Tommy Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros doesn't that make Lindros #2???? What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well since you asked... #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season. #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years. #3 Mark Recchi. Again you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice. Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either. Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come. Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year. Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him. A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members: Tom Misnik a member of the mailing list would like to exchange E-mail addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer. If you're interested you can send him mail at: att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick) 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder though). They scored as many goals as they allowed 319. The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985. I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them. I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable.

Well as long as we're being unduly cocky here It's obvious that the Pens will cone out of the Patrick Division *not* the Caps and also that they will win thier third Stanley Cup.

"2","I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on another system and thought it would be of interest on campuses where the administration or the athletics department wants to eliminate the women's ice hockey team. Women Athletes TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling: Brown University Ordered to Restore Two Women's Varsity Teams To: National Desk Sports Writer Contact: Lynette Labinger 401-421-9794 home 401-274-7507 or Ray Marcaccio 401-831-8900 both of Trial Lawyers For Public Justice WASHINGTON April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Court order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women's gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling in Cohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ) is the national public interest law firm representing the women athletes. This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of opportunities to participate they can only eliminiate men's teams said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant co-counsel in the case. The class action filed April 1992 charged Brown with violating Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions receiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as university-funded sports in May 1991 allowing them to continue to compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for uniforms travel coaches and all other expenses.  They had also been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members. This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney & Labinger.  Universities across America need to reevaluate their programs quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced. Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State University Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) and Colgate University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity teams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities TLPJ is representing women athletes at IUP. In addition to Labinger and Bryant TLPJ's legal team included: Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell DeLuca & Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The National Women's Law Center Women's Sports Foundation and National Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in support of TLPJ's appeal. -30-"

It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line.  And the announcers admittedly homers kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs because it was obvious to them and I would have thought to anyone who saw the replay that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This to me is unheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about the Leaf chances this year. cordially as always rm -- Roger Maynard maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca"

Keenan has talked with Walsh in the past (he came up to see Kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds funny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well.....) I'm not sure if walsh will go but if Keenan is getting 700000 and walsh even gets 100000 that's a 30% pay raise for walsh (not to mention a nice career move....)

I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   If  you asked  somone  who  had never heard of hockey before if LA played in the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be? What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation. >>I am glad that the names are being changed for another reason.

It is much easier to be an element of change Hardly.  The established situation existed prior to Smythe  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league an oligop- olistic professional system in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are however stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made however is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up. >or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates >a new situation.  If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than I'm sure >you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive >defenseman. What's wrong with best defenceman period?  Was there  ever  a  better defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby Orr's  then  in the interests of education why don't you take a poll and find out how many people know who Norris was?

Yes it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country.  Being a North Stars fan it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner. Hopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities within the next five years.  Even if this is the case a lot has been lost in the North Stars move... KEA"

Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best strategy given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45 when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets. Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D E sections). Others can add on their opinions as well. Kevin L.

"2","The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium. Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead. The Hawks came out strong in the first period outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period. Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal. Two minutes later on a Hawks power play Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead. Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net. Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period. With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play Steve Smith was called for slashing giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07. The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle. Just 17 seconds later Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3. The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play. The game was carried live on ABC the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24 1980 when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals. The best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday in St. Louis.

"2","The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the  4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year $85000/year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. Mallen was the third viable pick for the position right behind Jeff Jackson (Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of Brown RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians. UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November of last year the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following its one year construction deadline. The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994 season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within New England the Bay State and Europe to draw on competitive top ice players for the University. UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources. ....

There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.  You might have to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them.  Look on the street under the message board or out on the street in front of the Hyatt or even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them the less money you'll pay and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face value or below if you wait until game time.  Might be better to pick them up earlier now though. rick"

Say for example another team had this record : 20-37-47; they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total. (The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7.

I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade the Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final all of which of course they lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt however keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series as he did not for the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston for that matter).

"2","Well put Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee) I visit the city regularly and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again the Admirals are an independent franchise and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10000 to 13000 which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders Hartford New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights. Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city. Sincerely Martin Hill Rt. 2 Box 155B Sault Ste. Marie MI (Home of LSSU:  Go Lakers!) P.S.  Anybody know what the attendance figures are for the IHL and how Milwaukee stacks up against other IHL cities such as Atlanta Phoenix San Diego Cleveland and Cincinnati?  If so please reply."

Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than those of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.

Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about him he was about as classy as Harold Ballard.  Only difference was that back then almost all the owners were like that so he seemed okay by comparison.

God Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings and they won the division by a point or two followed closely by Toronto who is also a good team!

As for The Habs reaching the Finals forget it.  Even I as a devoted Wings fan will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux Jagr Tocchet Stevens and Barrasso its a done deal.

Any other The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach era when Darryl Sittler was called a cancer on the team he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain. Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead Sittler got traded to Detroit. Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago. During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh he wouldn't take it neither. The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia Bobby Clarke arguably one of the great captains of all time was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full. -- cordially as always                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca So many morons... rm                                                   ...and so little time."

Can't believe people actually put >win as first in a tie breaker...... Golly I love stupid people. :-) Listen Rex this is hockey.  The NHL to be precise.  And in the NHL there exist these things called ties.  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. There also exits these things called wins.  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah only two teams play each other at a time so I can say the opponent.)  A team gets two points for a win.  So let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins 36 losses and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So Rex when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker well then that's what it means.  In our example the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the better record even though both teams had the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post Rex maybe you should go back and read it again very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) -- Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't even understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? And if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game would it hurt to play David Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming before noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on their machine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs he seemed a bit confused. When I explained a bit more in detail he then said that's upto to our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel I understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this preemption.

"2","As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected to show up especially in their own zone as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others) but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings Pat Conacher was especially impressive. The games was VERY chippy as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks cross-checks punches hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh Paul Kruse or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return. I still think the Flames should win this series but they better buckle down. - Vlad the Impaler"

NOBODY!  Quebec got a pick Detroit got 4 but absolutely no Chicago!  How odd. Here are the losers: Detroit:	20 Chicago:	16	(so there they are!) Pittsburgh:	6 Vancouver:	4 Boston:		2 Calgary:	2 Los Angeles:	1	what?!? Toronto:	1 LOS ANGELES???????  Are you out of your mind?!?!?  Good luck to you you'll need it! So Pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the Stanley Cup.  They'll statistically beat Detroit in 6 games.  HAHA  that's happening!  NOT!  As I said every one of my picks will come true and I picked Chicago to lose to Pittsburgh in the finals so tough luck to all you who picket Detroit. Well tough luck to all of ya!

"2","Here is a summary of Don Cherry's coach's corner from April 18 1993. It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series. Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team. Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand. Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don who just saw his shadow and proclaimed Will you look at dat eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty. Next Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL. From there Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals. Next Ron showed an old picture of Don when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships. Finally Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold. Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs. Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode. I'll give it a 5.5 out of 10. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca) \  \                  |Department of Computing Science \  \_______          |University of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada. \    ###  \     _   |--------------------------------------------------- \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit...          - U. of A.

When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level. In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray- way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today. He fails in comparison to Sinden Sather Savard Caron Fletcher and Quinn in my estimation. I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's. Gregmeister"

"2","Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking wishful thoughts but being totally off the ball. The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe. (for those that don't know the best teams from lower divisions get promoted and the worst get demoted). Would European fans put up with our if you've paid you can play attitude?? How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a good product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's record every year......1940!! haha (sorry had ta say it)). If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe maybe teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like Halifax or Adirondack....ok so Halifax isn't a good example) would eventually get promoted and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division (unlike Ottawa SJ Edmonton etc.). Fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect) and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can dream can't I??)

A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. > > The fact of the matter is that despite last nights shutout he doesn't > > have what it takes.

Does that make Soderstrom's shutouts less impressive because of > Toronto's lack of offense? YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies or a GM looking to make a trade you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by. But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him. > Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the #1 goalie (Soderstrom > was being treated for his heart ailment).

FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders it was Tommy this Tommy that and oh yeah Dom has played well too. > By the way what was the final card on Monday night?

They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities. When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis Gainey etc you are comparing apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of player.  For a team to be successful they need to have all types of players- this includes defensive forwards. When compared with other defensive forwards Bob Gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played. Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better defensive forward but he wasn't. Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey. Gregmeister"

That's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour) are the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy but how about Tommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't really play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies in the league (McLean Essensa Vernon) had unspectacular years.

"2","Well the tentative rules anyway.  And of course since the season is not entirely over tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey season is starting!!!!! Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions AND the number of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be weighted so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important but the early rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring: Pick 1st round winner way off on games:  2 points Pick 1st round winner within one game:   3 points Pick 1st round winner pick # of games:   5 points Pick 2nd round winner way off on games:  3 points Pick 2nd round winner within one game:   4 points Pick 2nd round winner pick # of games:   6 points Pick conference champ way off on games:  5 points Pick conference champ within one game:   6 points Pick conference champ pick # of games:   9 points Pick Stanley Cup champ way off on games: 8 points Pick Stanley Cup champ within one game:  10 points Pick Stanley Cup champ pick # of games:  14 points Pick loser in 7 series goes 7:           2 points Pick loser in 7 series decided in Game 7 OT: 4 points (these last two are sympathy points probably won't happen anyway) Obviously picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some tests to see if the format is fair but probably I will be too lazy to modify it so the scoring will probably be like this.

"2","Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have affected the AHL this year. ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems. On-ice the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played home games in places like Montreal Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff home games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax NS. One demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium. Despite the problems Toronto officials insist that the Leafs will return to St John's once the strike ends. =================================================== SENATORS SOLD The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian NHL team with an American AHL affiliate and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL head office but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown New Brunswick and are expected to move there. ================================================== DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise. Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city. The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year. ============================================================ SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble. ========================================================= CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE Despite rumors to the contrary the Capitals will follow the Baltimore Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team the Baltimore Skipjacks announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. ====================================================== AHL GAME OF THE WEEK In early January the AHL started a game of the week. The game produced by I believe Pyman Productions was televised across the Canadian Maritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of the week one in Canada and another in the US but since then there has been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and I believe Atlantic Sports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not sure if playoff games will be covered. ===================================================== UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED? There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next season. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them. ===================================================== WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR ONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION Northern Division			Southern Division ADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACK SPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELD PROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCE CD ISLANDERS				CDI PORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY BINGHAMTON Southern Division			ROCHESTER HERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTON BINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICA ROCHESTER AMERICANS HAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic Division UTICA (?)

"2","Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again. It looks like the B's have peaked at the right time. Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end. After what they did to Montreal and Quebec these teams will be out for revenge. If Neely can stay healthy and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration on Ulf (I don't fight) Samuelson. I don't agree with fighting in the NHL but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good it's him. This is going to be a good series Go Bruins!!!! Rchard richard@amc.com"

"2","As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight I will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc. that went through for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them. I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings of course are subject to my own biases but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and/or did not play for another NHL team this season. Thus then let's go to the goaltenders... #1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11th Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		P (D) It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy in '87 '88 and '89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading) but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie. But Hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the Sharks' first ever victory the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames. As he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was. #30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rd Acquired:	'91-92 from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft Grade:		C Hackett after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season simply wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles almost-shutout against Tampa Bay etc.) Hackett finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 GAA watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected early to carry the team along; instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next year. #31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie) Acquired:	'91-92 signed as undrafted free agent Grade:		I (A-) It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary Flames) Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started the season poorly in Kansas City but finished strong prompting the Blades' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL; last year he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs picking up all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year because with prospects Dan Ryder Trevor Robins and Scott Cashman coming along if he doesn't make it next year he may not ever. #32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1st Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		B+ I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he's a bona fide NHL goaltender perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had getting the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26. He has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except of course the goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season Irbe's the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts. =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

Ville Siren's slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1 and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin 1-2 after the first period. The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then during the Finnish pressure Sweden turned the game around in 1:47. Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front who backhanded the puck low 2-3. Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund and the Finnish defense let Ahlund skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal 3-3. Next Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since there was traffic in front 4-3. Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan the Shadow Nilsson. Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake 5-3. Then Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal and after that he came in alone with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot. The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side. But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved. All in all a decent game where the defense wasn't the best. Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations. Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson- Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again it seems to be a working WC line. Stillman good on defense. Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner hjaelmen och jobba!) Roger Hansson Challe Berglund Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros. Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game we've seen him a lot better so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC. I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter- resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Starting lines: SWEDEN					FINLAND 35.

After a > couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the > Nordic  (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting > local talent as prooposed). That's a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros Sean Burke Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks Keith Tkachuk Scott Lachance Bret Hedican Shawn McEachern Steve Heintze Ted Donato Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the NHL while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players: (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player) FINLAND: D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13 C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16 R-Teemu Selanne.....27 L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January) SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7 C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18 R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13 L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14 This would be interesting. Clearly Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen Vancouver's Lumme Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie) 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston Vancouver Calgary and Montreal on paper! So the dynasty talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton's dynasty crumbled in the late '80s. Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a compromise prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this the amateur draft should be open to anyone. > ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- >  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

Shaver when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him) What will you do now? responded First I'm going to get me a new pair of slippers.

"2","The new name is Florida Panthers. The panther is an endangered species mostly located in the Everglades. A couple of years ago there were license plates made with Panthers on them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund). The name of the new President of the Panthers should be announced today. As of yesterday's paper Huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at the Miami Arena this fall.  The team has a guaranteed two-year lease with the arena with four one-year options that could run through 1999. It's not our choice James Blosser a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said about ruling out the arena as a long term option.  The NHL told us we can't stay there.  It's not economically feasible. One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox and advertising revenue at the arena reducing the hockey team's profit potential. The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward Dade and Palm Beach counties. A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium where residents 10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena ending an eight-year battle of wills. Compliments of the News/Sun-Sentinel. Jim G. Fitz...Sanchez...Castranova..."
"2","As I promised I would give you the name of the Panther's president. After Huizenga announced the team name he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers. A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL Bill Torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair. The Panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticket-price information in early next month.  In the meantime Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke the VP and GM. The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park the Big Cypress National Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida. The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats Torrey said. Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice. More BIO: In Torrey Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968 only their second NHL season.

You can try those >if the local baseball teams aren't playing at the same time anyway. According to this morning's Post-Gazette: The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am) unless the Pirates are playing.  When the Pirates play the games will be carried by WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games starting with tonight's game. In fact after this season KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv  with 17 of the games to be simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games as well as some of the early round playoff games will be available by subscription tv only. To receive the games you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars. Also under the new deal there will no longer be radio/tv simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team and a radio broadcast team. No word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald are both under contract with KDKA but their contracts expire at the end of this season.  KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hire Lange and Steigerwald.

"2","(Detroit April 19) In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the Detroit Redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Leafs could not be faulted as they completely dominated the inferior Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of Andy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the league's best team.

In addition I do not >think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of >people that are interested in hockey so it's a pointless exercise anyway. There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages.  And of course they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time. Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an Americanization of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is American or not is irrelevant. >If the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not >central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is >whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' >would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to >play in.

No. In what still IMHO ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed GM Eddie Johnston and Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped him of the Captain's C in December of 1990. The whole organization (read: EJ and Ley and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all season starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract publicly humiliating him stripping him of the C and then trading him that Spring to the Penguins. Classy guy that EJ. The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent Ulf) was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today. [Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it acquired Verbeek Cassels Sanderson Poulin Nylander etc. He stripped the roster but he DID lay a foundation.] -SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder) -steveg@cadkey.com"
"2","And now I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics: I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games goals assists points and penalty minutes for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why? Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...) Anyway after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list I came up with: NHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories. Marty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%) Igor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%) These two are close in games goals assists and points but are too far off in PIM. This leaves as the most average player in the NHL: Bobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%) What an honor. I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and Carpenter were still in the top three but Rob DiMaio came flying up from behind to take the title: NHL average:		53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIM Igor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%) Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%) Rob DiMaio (TB)		54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%) It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it. -SG And now back to our regularly scheduled programming..."

Yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

"2","There was apparently a 30 minute special here on the Penguins' season on ABC (WTAE - channel 4) immediately preceding the opening game against the Devils on Sunday.  I only turned it on in time to watch the credits.  If anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow it to dub it I would appreciate it.  I would be willing to come pick it up and I'll return it the next day and buy you a beer.  Please respond via e-mail.  Thanks a lot. Oh yeah.  Was it any good? -Billy"

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second). The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile the Red Wings were skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't detect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job). Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff game in a few years -- nervous. For the Leafs sake I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies for game 2.  If game 1 is indicative of the series it's gonna go quick. -Tom Galvin       galvint@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil"

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night). But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball. So relax.  I'm happy.  (I don't get SportsChannel anyway). -Tom Galvin              galvint@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil"
"2","Us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools often don't get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition. I (and I'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games could be posted to this group right away. basically all we need are goal scorers and assists don't bother with times penalties shots etc... this would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very happy. I guess with the Senators out golfing now the local papers have lost interest.  ;-) thanks. kd. --"

"2","1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports. ------------------------------------------------- Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93 The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18605 at the Saddledome in Calgary. Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries. The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this morning he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday. 1st period: 1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office' moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor who got the puck between the face-off dot and the hash mark shot off the pass beating Vernon low and between the legs. Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30 giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period. 2nd period: The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4 Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game. 1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri with the puck in the neutral zone tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey on his stick side for a short hander. 2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease. 3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass from the near face-off dot beating a diving Vernon on the glove side. 4-1. 2:59 later the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon. Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40 giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period. 3rd period: The Kings used the phrase Initiate not retaliate and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game. 5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly who was behind him wacked at the puck sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon. Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4. 5-2. Otto skating down the far side stepped around McSorley cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey. Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards drawing a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 8:19) took penalties. 5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis at the near point passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA. 6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line he passed the puck into the low slot on the far side to Carson who shot off the pass beating Vernon on the ice stick side. At the 16:17 mark Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct and he took the Flames right out of the game. On the plus side:  The Kings for the most part played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing. On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track. Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix. Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point. The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game. Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games. The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

A good GM (like Murray) can I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli Sheppard Ysebaert Howe Coffey and Riendeau (plus some depth players) without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects. All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better? The year before he took over the Wings didn't even make the playoffs. There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings did OK but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch and grab style.  They didn't have much talent. Gerald Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not ready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the draft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was Lapointe. Ron ********** And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry about.  I'm getting bored reading the same problems in the paper decade after decade.  I want people to have to deal with new problems. ... President Bill Clinton   2-4-93"

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor. If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success. But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway. Gregmeister"

Just wanted to glow a little. I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice. In fact one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play. He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards for the most part couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense. It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter. If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.) Mom."

No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc.  Well the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot dammit.  Besides Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT. Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot. Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article if possible. >Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and >on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have >gone in. I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct it shouldn't have gone in regardless. >Oh well at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha Ha!!--) Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit what a player. Speaking of great players man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone especially Sundin is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red Army. But I still hate the team. On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly especially against Detroit. Same goes for Calgary; very very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I hate that team anyway. dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca (pissed-off Habs fan)"

FWIW I do not think the flaming was warranted nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an observation... However that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan') or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so it's a pointless exercise anyway. If the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....) >Exactly true.

The whole Russian strategy is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also it's not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid even if Federko used to be a great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage with those that didn't being soured mainly by injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered). Put Scotty Bowman Pat Burns or any of the other better coaches in the league behind the bench of this Detroit team and they could beat anybody. --Randy"

No Caleb it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with; it is superb whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds from CBC (-;).  It's the amount of hockey they're showing or lack of it that we're complaining about.

"2","Apparently Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted it; to make things worse I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back.  If someone responds I will repost it when I get it; otherwise I will re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that. #8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season:	3rd Acquired:	'91-92 free agent from Minnesota Grade:		I (C-/D+) No netter/fan watching the Sharks including me knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights but he wasn't in San Jose he wasn't in Kansas City and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning DePalma had an excellent week scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just 3 more points in 15 more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful and neither the Sharks nor we miss him. #10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season: 3rd Acquired:	'91-92 trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:		A/A- After an early slump Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with 66 points in 79 games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit but Garpenlov finishing second in the MVP voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11 183 lbs.) he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year. #15	DAVID BRUCE		Season: 5th Acquired:	'91-92 from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:		I (?) After a banner '91-92 when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games) Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded. #18	MARK PEDERSON		Season:	3rd Acquired:	'92-93 trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:		I (B) It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games) but after riding the pine early in the season Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy Pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size (and the willingness to throw it around although he's not considered a physical forward) and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly Pederson can do. #20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th Acquired:	'91-92 free agent from Boston Grade:		I (B+/B) Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice.  However although he did look great at times the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter who will turn 30 on May 6 always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season. #28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season: 1st Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		I (B+/B) I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age 23 ready for regular NHL duty at least for a team like the Sharks finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season. #41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season: 1st Acquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:		I (?) After a all-star season at Kansas City Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9 165 lbs.) Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City. #42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season: 1st Acquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:		I (?) Like Beaufait Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready. #44	MICHEL PICARD		Season: 1st Acquired:	'92-93 trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:		I (B-/C+) The 23-year-old Picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games scoring 4 goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the NHL although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft. #45	DODY WOOD		Season: 1st Acquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:		I (D+/D although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all) I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready and needs at least another season at KC where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer. =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

"2","I finally got it back with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it. #2	ROB ZETTLER		Season:	4th Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		C/C- Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately this still wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer if that.  He works hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year. #3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2nd Acquired:	'91-92 free agent from New Jersey Grade:		C/C- IMO Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92 playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he playing the first part of this season in Kansas City was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it then appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season he was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year. #4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2nd Acquired:	'91-92 from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:		B+ After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92 More had a rather disappointing '91-92 as he was not particularly good defensively and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He then proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the team's most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games) but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman. #5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4th Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		B- Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He then had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force. #6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1st Acquired:	'91-92 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:		I (A) At the time of his injury (December 30 against the Philadelphia Flyers) Ozolinsh was well on track to be IMO the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games) but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points) which of course tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries he is ready to be a star. #19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1st Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		B Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense but after being billed as an offensive defenseman he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents. =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

In agreement with your previous post I think Francis is a tremendous and generally underrated complete player.  I would LOVE to have him here in a Capitals uniform where he would certainly be the #1 center (even though Pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated). Francis impresses me in many ways as an ethical Dale Hunter.  Tons of heart and can-do attitude with a lot of different skills but none of the cheap shots and few penalty minutes.  Not to mention nearly always coming through when it's important."

"2","Hello Hockey fans. Bonjour tout le monde! Well in Salt Lake City this past Sunday the local ABC station decided not to televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde! Anyway I have a satellite dish and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr) and I can not find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing everything from 11:00 AM MDT to 5:00 PM MDT. I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday now that ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to pull in three games (11:00 am 2:00 pm and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish but I am not sure. IF anybody has a schedule pleas emial it to me.  As you can see I have to telent to get rec.sport.hockey and it is sometimes difficult to get a link. Thanks in advance Merci d'avance P.S.  Anglais ou francais d'accord.

"2","What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns. If you were Pat Burns what would you do? Living in the Bay area I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea... Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now. Perhaps perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the swing players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard. Score Gilmour score! Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-?? Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots) * as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their checking line against these finesse players - well then let them play. ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot). I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit out-skated and out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday. -jake. GO LEAFS !!!"

"2","Here is a press release from the White House. Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine Black Bears NCAA Division I hockey champions: The Rose Garden 9:58 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here. I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory. Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today. You know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.) In government as in hockey leadership is important.  In the United States Senate our team has a great captain the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me. On your hockey team the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about. Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind. I think it's important as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives. We now have another role model and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.) (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.) (The President is presented with an autographed stick.) THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.) * * * * * * Q  Mr. President did you authorize the move on Waco this morning sir? THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI. Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed? THE PRESIDENT:  No they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment the FBI. Q  Is this a raid? THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions. Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning? Q  Any chance for that stimulus package? THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter). SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter. THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell he's worth a quarter any day. Q  Any chance for your bill sir? THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later around noon and talk some more. Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise. THE PRESIDENT:  Well I know he did but look Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one but you can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it. THE PRESS:  Thank you END       10:10 A.M. EDT -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044"

You actually get 1 more free game than last year and there will be no more radio-only games. Its a good deal.  Last year everybody bitched about Baldwin breaking up the team.

(actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states where ice time is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault who retired so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all Danny Gare was captain before him and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld Gerry Meehan and Floyd Smith are the others in reverse order last to first.  I was a bit young at the time so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-) Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded almost unless you're a franchise player. -- Valerie Hammerl			Birtday -(n)- An event when friends get hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu	together set your dessert on fire then acscvjh@ubms.cc.buffalo.edu	laugh and sing while you frantically try v085pwwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu  to blow it out."

"2","How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to score?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped they're penalized again! Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going to you have to do it for both teams. Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities and then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty. Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line can smarten up that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough -- he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck maybe he should be benched. I hate to repeat Grapes but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net he did okay considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can easily do it again. My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand by that. Don't fret Leafs fans in order to win in 7 the other team has to win 3! :-) Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard and he'll never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the first one).

Can't believe people actually put > win as first in a tie breaker...... Then allow me to enlighten you Rex. You see there's a thing called a tie. A tie is worth one point (I know I know. You're not good at math. But bear with me). A win is worth two points. So getting two ties is the same as getting one win. If your team played two games won one and lost one you'd have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both we'd also have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different.

If he was as great a GM as you claim I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below: >and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent >enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success. I think at this point there's a personal emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders it's fine for us to say He should hire a different coach.  In fact he has talked about doing so in the past.  But the press (here in Detroit at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back. So it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties and the team will improve as a result. I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense once he steps down as coach we'll see how good of a GM he really is. >But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM >so none of this is true anyway.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall but just because his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities. Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very well but the Haller shot off the post in OT the rebound bouncing over Bellows' stick the Brunet breakaway the 3 chances for LeClair ... all those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... >Blaming Stewart is just an >excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst >goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot dammit. Sure no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank but against an explosive team like Quebec they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary. >Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear >traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. The defense for the 1st time this season played remarkably keeping Sakic Nolan and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night. >Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than >five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME >ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads. But I don't >think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear >the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal). This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy by no means can be singled out for this loss. >Roy is paid big money to >play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot. And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the season. >Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that he should let >the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this >article if possible. The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of Burnsian hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the extra 2. Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans the media and Racicot perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team. >I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't >think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) >in the first place.  But you are correct it shouldn't have gone in >regardless. If you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never have been an OT then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all. Yaska  ! yaska@eecg.toronto.edu !

I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage. At the end of last season the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions (Fenton Bozek Anderson and a couple others I can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not. And they traded Mullen because he wanted to go not because he wasn't good enough but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions. An example from this season Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept because of his age. I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around. The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But you have to find the right balance. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Cole  (steve@sep.stanford.edu apple!sep!steve) Department of Geophysics Stanford University Stanford CA 94305"

"2","Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals. (Hey look who's #4!)  I'll try to post the standings after each game (i.e. every two days). I managed to recover the email lost up to Saturday night so all I'm missing is mail that arrived between early Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. Many people re-sent their teams so you may have received two replies back from me.  If your team name is not on this list please resend your team to me and I'll see what I can do.  Any kind of proof you sent it on the weekend will help your case.  :-)  Seriously this is only a fun pool and I trust each person to be honest. Again sorry for any inconvenience and I hope the pool is still fun for you. - Andrew USENET Hockey Playoff Draft Standings Posn	Team				Pts	Rem	Last Posn 1.

"2","To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota: From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper) various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. Paul Pioneer Press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center Civic Center (St. Paul) and yes even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty confident that Minnesota will get a team and that the Target Center will ultimately win out.  He argued however that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the inter-site competition the columnist (sorry I can't remember his name) believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also because of the situation with the Timberwolves things will be delayed until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center. However they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to this mess a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future viability of the Met Center which obviously delays the process even further.  I hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met which may happen. Regarding possible candidates the three teams are Hartford Tampa Bay and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota  Ice Demons?) although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't been announced yet it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible and I wouldn't be surprised to see Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So Minnesota may end up getting another team but it may take a few years. Go Sabres! Robert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis) randolin@polisci.umn.edu"

I think it starts tonight. We're getting the Sabres-Bruins as the replacement game (and probably so are you) while the Devils-Penguins game is played on SCNY and the Islanders-Caps are the overflow game on the SCA (SCNY Plus).  If the Sabres-Bruins ends early then we'll go to the Devils-Penguins game (assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last minute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks ago).  ESPN's coverage started last night by accident but as one or more other writers have pointed out they could've gone to wild hog wrestling for the evening instead ... gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

Yes a point well-taken ... however even in areas that finally got some games there's something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ... when you know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ... >If people want hockey on TV they should watch hockey on TV.

"2","I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (My roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks for explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other then that hats off to ESPN. Now if they'll only make a habit of this. Yeah right! Baseball seasons started (Zzzzzz.....) =) KOZ LETS GO CAPS!!"

Oh to be back in the good old days when I lived in Florida (Florida for Petes sake!!) and could watch hockey every night as ESPN and USA alternated coverage nights. Oh well I guess it would be too simple for the home office to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present... Of course I shouldn't complain.

"2","This is a general question for US readers: How extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada it is almost impossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had an opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl the latter because I'm in the wrong time zone!).  We (in Canada) are basically swamped with coverage and I wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even locally in the US and how much precedence they take over say local news if the games go into double-OT.

"2","Game two of the Detroit - Toronto series will be a rougher game.  I believe that Clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars.  I believe that Probert will take exception to this and a fight between Clark and Probert will result. I know this sounds kind of ridiculous but I know game two Toronto will come out hitting. Any takers on this issue?"

From this account it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal Mike. Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted or hitting the goaltender or whatever. And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series I can only say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games. There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation. Alan"

"2","By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff At 9:11 Thursday night the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer. Their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of 17816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues. The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5 Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing because the Blues quit playing. They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired. ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end Blues coach Bob Berry said. If the goal had counted he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger. ``It wasn't pretty at the end he said. ``We played 36 37 great minutes as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have but it did. Still the Blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium. The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points. The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment. ``It's a shame we let down said Kevin Miller one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy. Instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won and that's all that matters said Brett Hull scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0 it was really tough to play. Some players didn't have a problem. ``Just because the score was announced our line didn't quit said Rich Sutter who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did that's not right. ``It was disappointing to see what was going on. Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss. ``I didn't know it was final he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs and that's great but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end. The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time. ``I told them I didn't want to see the score I didn't want to know the score Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game and that's the approach we took. If Minnesota took a lead Berry feared the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led he worried the Blues might quit. Until the announcement the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period scoring his 50th of the season. Then Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period. With the teams playing four on four Miller broke in on left wing deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period. Then just 10.5 seconds later Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone. Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend. Last year Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23. ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now and I know he was watching. I know he's happy. Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later making it 5-1. Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period. Then it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period. The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build an expansion franchise. He'll probably be in the Hall of Fame next year! :-) This continues a tradition of front office gaffs: - Paul Anka and the arena deal - Denis Potvin and the GM postion - Mike Bossy and the scoring coach.

"2","I've heard that you can score on Belfour by shooting high because he goes down a lot and on Potvin by shooting high on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so deep in the net.  Any truth to these? Brad A Wings fan but no predictions."

"2","Farewell Minnesota fans.  Get stuffed Dallas Stars. As the North Stars fade to black I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul are not long without an NHL team.  It just seems right that the hotbed of amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss of the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the 1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while). I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.  (I got it to spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up.)  What a glorious season that was for the North Stars! dwarf -- W.

Throughout the year Francis consistently recieved more ice time than Jagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject I am pretty sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.

Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out Vanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect of: You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask and he can't stop a beachball! You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all but I cracked up when I heard it. I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw.

Actually fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck Grillo) the Sharks are already on their 3rd office of the GM.

Well having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times this isn't quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C. at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no beyond just a no-no). Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team) but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call. >#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th >Acquired:	'91-92 free agent from Boston >Grade:		I (B+/B) > He >is very unlikely to be back next season. Always gave 110% best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio) but hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal as though Carter wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far. The Sharks have told me point blank that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff but as one said to me you have to make room for the kids. Carter in fact refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement but I haven't heard anything official.

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for delay of game for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point when the Germans were starting to come up strong. I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events. If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch for example). But reading the above posting I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all) Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries...). In my opinion your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.

Chris Pronger's name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that they'll take Niedermayer.  They may take Pronger except that they already have too many defensive prospects. =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

"2","1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes. -------------------------------- Playoffs: --------- *Stauber disturbed by third-man theme by Rick Sadowski Daily News Barry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender. I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and I'm not  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  I think I have worked hard enough for that. Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory. But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey. Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average twice was yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29. Yet when the series resumes Wednesday Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn. If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?  Stauber wondered.  Not that I'd be happy with No. 2 but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs. Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure. While insisting he is the Kings' goalie of the future Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to Vancouver on Thursday. Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey and he didn't do it Melrose said.  An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup. I'm not blaming Robb for the losses but if you're going to be No. 1 you've got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe I expect more from him than he does. Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1 struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster then came on at the end. I expect more from myself than anybody including Barry Melrose said Stauber a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989 only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries. What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise I wouldn't be here. Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry doesn't know me but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything I'm a perfectionist. Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. But even though I didn't play well I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's a bit of a jump he said.  You're almost No. 1 or if you play a good game you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain to him why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I do know is it's a sport.  I'll be there. Melrose's goalie of the future statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. Before you know it I'll be 30 and there will be no future he said. ------ *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC Channel 7 here in LA.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding Ranford. Later on Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge to Sweden in creating more opportunities. Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros Eric one timed the puck but Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark Canada started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman came in on Soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post 1-0 Canada. The Swedes picked up their game after that and Peter Forsberg had a shot that hit Ranford's post (the inside) went parallel to the goal line and out. Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took a shot from the slot Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by the far post passed the puck and Ranford was beat 1-1. Third period started as the other periods Swedes having most of the pressure but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal. At 5:54 Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it. That resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman can't cover the puck in the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever he explained afterwards) and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side close to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal. Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside Gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 25 periods. The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a rebound from Soderstrom where the Swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room. A very good game (the best in the WC so far?) with both goalies playing great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden but Ranford even played better than Soderstrom that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best goalie in the world were some comments after the game. Canada played a very disciplined defense Ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals. The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin- Nilsson. Swedish defense played well 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros and managed this very well. Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC and considering that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game he played very well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game partly because of the Swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesman's mistake on the 1-3 goal.

As far as the play in the second period goes the Finns seemed to have the most control so a 1-0 lead was warranted as I saw it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SWEDEN			   CANADA Goaltender:	30 Tommy Soderstrom		30 Bill Ranford Defense:	 8 Kenneth Kennholt		 5 Norm Maciver 14 Fredrik Stillman		24 Dave Manson 3 Peter Popovic		25 Geoff Smith 55 Peter Andersson		19 Brian Benning 7 Arto Blomsten		 6 Terry Carkner 28 Roger Akerstrom		 3 Garry Galley 4 Derek Mayer Forwards:	29 Mikael Renberg		15 Dave Gagner 9 Thomas Rundqvist		27 Adam Graves 34 Mikael Andersson		22 Mike Gartner 19 Markus Naslund		20 Paul Kariya 21 Peter Forsberg		88 Eric Lindros 18 Jonas Bergqvist		 8 Mark Recchi 5 Patrik Juhlin		17 Rod Brind'Amour 20 Jan Larsson			 9 Shayne Corson 4 Stefan Nilsson		11 Kevin Dineen 22 Charles Berglund		10 Geoff Sanderson 26 Michael Nylander		12 Greg Johnson (34 Andersson/18 Bergqvist)	14 Brian Savage 16 Kelly Buchberger -- ((\\  //| Staffan Axelsson \\  //|| etxonss@ufsa.ericsson.se \\_))//-|| r.s.h. contact for Swedish hockey"

The Russians and the Czechs are unable to beat easy >opponents and the Swedes beat Austria only 1:0?!? > It's the opening-game effect maybe. Pros arrive late nervousness for rookie WC players and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these worse nations. I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game the better it is since the chances of an upset are greater then. Some other reasons why the worse teams are so tough to beat was presented by Hans Virus Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland). 1) The worse teams (referring to France Switzerland Austria Italy etc) have now usually world class goalies. 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined they take much less unnecessary penalties. 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them run out of gas. 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor. >  The only convincing winner was...

"2","Relying on Canadian tourists and transplanted Northeasterners to support a team in Miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving cities without a team such as San Diego & Milwaukee. I wish the Panthers or whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to Hispanics they're in deep doo-doo. Already there are rumors that Tampa may move to Milwaukee."
"2","I loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance was excellent. It had a sleek modern look. This was the first time I heard Thorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leave Al Micheals out of this. He annoys me. I'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. My guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from Feb.-April and then the playoffs. I envy you Canadians with your TSN & CBC. Maybe I'll get a dish to pick up Canadian TV. How much are those things BTW?"

"2","On Tuesday when it was raining in Chicago ESPN provided bonus hockey coverage.  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.  People must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the U.S The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they can't skip the baseball game.

Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump & pull back most of the time. Hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3 & could have had 5 plus another 4 in 2nd.

"2","Here are the final stats for the CHL for the 1992-1993 season. Central Hockey League 5840 S. Memorial Drive Suite 205 Tulsa OK  74145 Phone:  (918) 664-8881 Fax:    (918) 664-2215 Founder and President - Ray Miron Commissioner - Monte Miron Marketing Director - Jim Goodman Information Director - Eric Kolb Each team is owned by the league with local intrests controlling day to day operations.  Working agreements and NHL affiliations are up to each team. Each team has a $100000 salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Each team is limited to 11 visas meaning at least 6 players must be Americans (Ignore this rule if you are Tulsa they only had 2 Americans on the roster during the playoffs).

Austin is a possibility if Dallas has to move.  Houston and San Antonio are in for this fall with Baton Rouge and Little Rock likely for 94-95.

Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge? A dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt. He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes.  Speaking of Chelios I wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade. I also wish we still had Corson. Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the bench. Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently.  I have no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with Carbonneau.  Savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front most of the time. Do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single Nordique gets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10 172) getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3 205) with no reply from the team except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit Denis Savard threw the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked Sundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer there's big trouble someplace... >Hextall made some good saves but >really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3 >& could have had 5 plus another 4 in 2nd. Aside from that second goal Roy did stand on his head.  The third period at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the period IMO and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made the saves (we'll ignore that second goal) so now it's up to the team. -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca P.S.  To all those Grant Fuhr doubters.....Buffalo 4 Boston 0. 'nuff said.  And did somebody say Dale Hunter was a playoff choker? I'd rethink that position :-)"
"2","Come on Boston where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what choke? I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than Buffalo or Quebec if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0 pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?). Ah well maybe the Devils will pull it out or maybe the Pens will lose in the second round but if not I hope the Bruins are there to meet them."

A low GAA against good > teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context > of comparing two goaltenders. Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night) their save percentages are close and their records are similar.  And with that I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season. You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose. > The same > for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances one he made a > great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If > you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by. But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course I thought that about Mark LaForest too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era. As for the Rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him. > But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs you saw a goalie > stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel > doesn't have a game like that in him. I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts. Anyway I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season:-). \ \ Joe Dakes                                 \/\ AT&T Microelectronics                      \/\ 555 Union Boulevard                         \ \ Allentown PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! alux1!jmd                                     \ \ jmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \ \__________ \____/_//__/"
"2","Tom Barrasso wore a great mask one time last season.  He unveiled it at a game in Boston. It was all black with Pgh city scenes on it.  The Golden Triangle (Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top along with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the really fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens logo and a space for the new (now current) logo. Tommy had designed the mask and his mother (an artist) painted it for him. But while wearing the mask the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The very next game Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask done in by a goalie's superstition. Lori"

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast Kamloops British Columbia has a population of about 50000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds pools etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say what does he know? He's from California. let me say that I was born and raised in Trail British Columbia a town of about 8000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team the Trail Smokeaters who by  the way were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).

Lack of ice is a big factor but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season which just ended cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance and the club dues cover ice time officials trophies etc.  Other areas have similar fees unless the city government subsidises some of the costs as Stockton does. By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the inner city areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd near 101 Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King Stockton's is in Oak Park Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street) Fresno's is out on the edge of town just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town off 580.  Most of the rinks are old and expensive to run with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee. -- Alan Hepburn           A man doesn't know what he knows National Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesn't know.

Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons even on the same team.  I never ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play. In my opinion Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand Jagr for how big fast and skilled he is can't even get 90 points no matter how inflated his +/- is. (By the way don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). -- Roland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu"

"2","After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team I thought I'd pass along a story I heard recently.  This is second hand so I don't know how true it is but I have no reason to doubt it either. Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry I can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center. Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high. Like I said I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if it's true don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.

"2","It was unlikely improbable.  For the Bruins it was the stuff of nightmares; for the Sabres it was a taste of heaven. For the first time since 1983 the Sabres have won the first three games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work. On the heels of a shutout one that took away Boston's home ice advantage the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked. John Blue got the nod for Boston supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday. Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny his fourth of the playoffs on the powerplay with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box. LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was Khmylev's first of the playoffs a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless a split of penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get his first courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third sending it into overtime. Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night it spelled sweet revenge as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box on a tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime. Both teams finished with 34 shots. Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2. Referee--Rob Shick. Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember I was only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger in a postgame interview noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk but the crowd was too loud even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each were out before Yuri made his appearance sans jersey.  When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was he responed yes (ok it was through an interpreter and he said more than that even more than the interpreter said but I digress).  The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English he must not understand playoffs.

Frankly I want to keep those three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston which of course is now a moot point). The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly consensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There were conflicts. Ferriera lost.

However his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned was scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming back Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line but comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.

Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL. Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years. He wrote a book on his experiences called Behind the Red Line (check it out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them. -- Mike Note: I hope I have my facts straight.

"2","During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman. Despite Brooks' lunatic comments and despite the Devils' line changing adantage in last night's game Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark.  Granted the hell-dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible. Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis.  Last night for instance he realized that the speed of Jagr Straka and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As a result Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played almost the entire game (he was always on the puck) and MacEachern scored a goal while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night. His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about success. While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson Bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly seen mark in  Pittsburgh."

Well I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general you should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another player. Felix Potvin IMO crossed that line on Wednesday. That two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead he slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a Leaf supporter (just a supporter I'm not a Leaf fan really) I was very disappointed. You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason many fans (and players) disliked them (that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but intentional) use of the stick. Gary"

He just wasn't diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately he'd just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination or fail to accept that something they've checked is OK now.  For example an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven ten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt it slowed his reflexes so he tried to go without).  In any event he is alive and well and living in San Diego while playing with the Gulls (IHL). > >Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

It was speculated at the time that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked) he never would have survived.  Ditto if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on standby. If you've seen video tape of the incident it is amazing how much blood there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror. Amazingly enough he made a full recovery and played again in the NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward. He did eventually get back to form and played another year or so after that and then I believe he retired.

"2","The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which except for boardaholics like Flatley doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too many talented finesse players so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If last night's game is any omen the Isles could be on their way to that ole championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT Tonelli scored the game winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity for years but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!

When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago NOT LAST YEAR they regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender. When Murray took over in Detroit the were about a .500 team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup contender. So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray. Gregmeister"

The last year before Bryan Murray took over the Wings did not make the playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived in his last two years they were respectively embarrassed in the first round by Chicago and then failed to make the playoffs (at a time a might add when there were only five teams in the Norris). It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before Quinn came but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the Norris also known as the Snorris division. Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders eight times a year while Detroit got to play such powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving so was everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris. Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good players they had Yzerman Burr and Probert and that was about it.  (And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team.  Then even his coaching began to degrade. >So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. >Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray. There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over some of which I outlined above but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender as I'm sure everyone reading this will agree. We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out like last year). >Gregmeister --Randy"

"2","The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin with) while I was watching I would have gone throught the roof! However everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN but they are not the ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the deal with ESPN they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L. should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to watch!  They more I write about this the more pissed off I get.  We must let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody out there knows how to go about doing this let me and everybody else know. Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it.... Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the 3rd game between NJ and Pitt he was being pushed while skating across the front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for holding.  They replayed the play and my roomate(who is clueless about hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him.  It is simple Mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic 2.  But the thing that really pissed me off is Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal I don't remember on the resulting PP and eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the outcome of a game. They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players and allows inferior teams to beat better ones. This has pissed me off for many years now and it has improved somewhat. However during the playoffs and 3rd periods the damn refs must misplace their balls because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got any. All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed. Steve"

"2","Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it! Aside from frustrated ravings I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense.  Boston players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he's also getting plenty of help. Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game.  As a result Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite bleak).  IMHO the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that they have an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 2nd and 3rd periods. (The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year. I'll never cheer for the Sabres...

Actually that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three straight games -- 12.5% 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course this doesn't include weighted average but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as good and Boston has a stronger team.

"2","Wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team Boston. Which Sweeney you ask...well of course Bob Sweeney the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1 and another BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes Neely countered a minute later but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series. Well the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet but I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I think Borque Neely Jouneau (sp?) and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not gonna waiger anything on this because I've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey. Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points but this was BLATENT.  Finally the Sabres won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting it up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming They score THEY SCORE!!!.  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on. Doug McKee mckee@cs.buffalo.edu"

I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).

With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this year a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the other hand was able to inspire the younger inexperienced players to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both of which came at exactly the right time. Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway?

"2","Hey man! - Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey I'm ready to invest in hockey equipment (particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockey lessons').  However I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment.  I've checked out local stores and looked at catalogs but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before actually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.

What are you complaining about? The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not covered 'til the final horn sounds.  With two channels SCNY and SCA late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will kick in at the end of local coverage.

My point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing this year.  This year we had more skill I'm all for that but if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they can't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you can't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks simply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this. They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not pay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will add some toughness to the team will help insure that next season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players or to take cheap shots.  It doesn't guarantee no injuries (nothing does) but it's something the Sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries. mark just say #####  #     #    #    ######  #    #   #####           ____ #     # #     #   # #   #     # #   #   #     #            -_ --__ #       #     #  #   #  #     # #  #    #                    \    --_ #####  ####### #     # ######  ###      #####                \      -_ # #     # ####### #   #   #  #          #                |       \ #     # #     # #     # #    #  #   #   #     #    __________ /         \_____ #####  #     # #     # #     # #    #   #####  ___________ /            \_____ ______________________________________________________________________________ Mark Spiegel  spiegel@lmsc.lockheed.com   Cow Palace:108/K/8  Epicenter: ?"

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals he must be doing something right. It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams. I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent. +/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent. You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.

Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he's not exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It was quite amusing as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew what he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey player is?  Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?

"2","What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk?  When I saw what happened I wanted to throw up and at the same time I was devastated since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive.  BTW I believe he picked up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident. To radically change the subject the Caps must be having nightmares about the Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the Islanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating.  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence it's evidence of the choke factor. -- Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!! kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!

You can't fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system. Lets face it A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective method... It is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't like it but that's the way the league is going. By the way there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a legal hit... After all Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that.)"
"2","I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference next week. While the exact details are not known it is believed to concern the Oiler's future. Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington. As for me my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market team they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems that the team had this year they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand if the team does move there is no place more deserving than Hamilton. Of course how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of Bettman?"

I guess the Canadian referee (one of the Isostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that but it didn't help much.

I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were at 2.9. In Bostonthe game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion from local sports teams. Quite frankly I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy to be proven wrong! Wellwell...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fanyou could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game... ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. MaybeESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.

Also I was just wondering if there is ANY college hockey east of Colorado (Alaska excepted).

However getting back to what-if games had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year then the Sharks go 0 for October and maybe Gund panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera Sather and Keenan all look like geniuses. A broken fax machine and Ferriera Keenan and maybe Kingston (and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you shiver doesn't it. :-) Bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for Kisio leaving I can concoct an equally bright one. >>If the Kisio-fiasco was the cause of Ferierra's down fall I hope >>it wasn't because he tried to trade Kisio but because he screwed it >>up.

The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill me in on this info? A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday morning.  Personally I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour saying he was a two-way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives? It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city. Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in> is the best two-way player in the league today.' There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to. Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center (Yes I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux.  In my opinion he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion if I'm in a different city. Sorry if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get this off my chest.

"2","I knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it was still too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16 they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia Alabama etc. but it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate. I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time without much promotion. Besides their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs. She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf was shown oin ABC would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She then couldn't give me a coherent answer. Also I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with thier sports programming. I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain bitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation. The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes the reason is low ratings. Then another time she says contractual obligations."

I would argue Gerald that Bowman is the first modern coach. Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach! I am left asking What is a modern coach if not Bowman? -jake."

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths is not so.  Roy is the 'villain' as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not they would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally required.  However when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's especially at such a crucial time in a game I don't think there are any legitimate excuses. >Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces >[description of lucky bounces.....] >Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal. > ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank but against >an explosive team like Quebec they gave them 1 opportunity too many with >a powerplay that was totally unnecessary. In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal only and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second goal. >This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities >as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau >were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave >up the bad goal. Roy by no means can be singled out for this loss. What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact you could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final result is decided.  If I get the time soon I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie is the last line of defence and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal and a team cannot afford such a goal. >>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot. >And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if you're going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times. >Roy is paid big money because >that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 For the record I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league.  In fact I agree that he is. >The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory >comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. I assume you are referring to me.  However I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective (and informed FYI) observations as derogatory I really can't help you. -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca"

Generally I agree with you. However (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball Tonite which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball and they cut away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if ESPN couldn't deliver they should have had a transistion plan to let SportsChannel pick up the slack. Nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S. Support your team; support your game.

"2","Just some thoughts: I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player but this time I couldn't resist.  During the Pens-Devils game last night second period I think Kevin Stevens was in the penalty box Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself!  All Kjell could do at 8'7 and 355 pounds was laugh! And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always supported the argument he does his job by being irritating but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them philosophy. As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night and last night as well although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end was pretty exciting.

Perish the thought...but you know you may be right at least as far as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go.  They all seem to be becoming BIG MONEY games much more so than at any previous time.  To think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now all that may be there is an AHL team at best...SIGH. The interesting thing is that the NHL is also expanding at the same time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to operate a team.  This would seem to indicate that there's a BIG shake-out about to occur in the next few years unless player salaries can somehow be brought under control.  Frankly I don't see how the NHL's current drive for expansion is supportable under its current operating conditions.  If revenue sharing AND a salary cap don't come into the NHL soon look out. -Steve"

We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It sucks I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass.  I was really pissed of about last night coverage.  I go to school in Ohio I *know* the Indians suck so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I would shoot myself. Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils game. Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract obligations* screw you ESPN.

North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden Finland Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen. I have to admit that the best players come from Canada but those regulars aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the class of his own). Tommi"

Let me know - maybe I'm missing something. From his Topps rookie year (as coach) card (74-75): For the past couple of seasons Don has been the highly-successful coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL but he is getting his first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins.  Named Coach of the Year in the AHL the last two years and he aims to make the Bruins a rough team again as they were a couple of years back.  Although he played 16 seasons of professional hockey Don never played a regular-season NHL game.  He did appear in one playoff game for Boston in 1956-57.

I can't remember how many times during the Penguins-Devils game they showed some guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal.  In fact I think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner.

"2","Okay... here's some gripeing (?griping?... whatever). (I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think) Okay ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN. ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the Red Wings/Toronto game... cool. But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday. I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game but ALAS it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind. I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green Kentucky [Bumbf*ck Egypt]) got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just don't get it. The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2 will turn on their TVs on Thursday and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game 3.  At least in my case I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game. If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN I'd be mad as hell. Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR SOMETHING. Matt Coohill P.S.  The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I have ever heard (as far emotion goes).  They had the enthusiasm of Droopy Dog.  I hope for better on Thursday."

"2","I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year all Isles wins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles. Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!! As for Pilon he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!! As far as the playoffs the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps. Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got to. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kind of young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!

"2","You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays the way he does does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players. Bobby Clarke Kenny Linsemen Pie McKenzie Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players like Ulf who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue and the league won't stop it the players should. A Christian Pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future you can bet Neely will have his day. The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup the Penguins would not even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey. Rich"

He wasn't all that bad a hockey player. But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years: ??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).

Didja see that one Rosie roofed against Roy in last year's playoffs? Courtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year and Courtnall always seems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall as a defensive liability? Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions? Janney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and a personable guy the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said? Soeven if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who else (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus Harry the Horse trader comes out on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry not in spite of him. BTW do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference behind any of the following: Pittsburgh Quebec Boston Washington Islanders.  Someone correct me if these five teams will not be in Montreal's conference. In summary things look bleak for the Habs at least in the near future.  I suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be that team that Lindros didn't want to play for. >I admit that I've been suffering lately with the Boston gets hot while >Montreal swans in the playoffs type years.

Not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective.

But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of the coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night they continued to broadcast the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control. Granted they did show some bonus coverage of the Caps and Isles but they cut away from the close game which went into double ot to update us on the fifth goal of the rout. Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between the pens and devils.

"2","4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN LEAD SERIES 3-0 ----------------------------------------------------- It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were cheering the Blues long before face-off time and they kept going for the entire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis Post-Disptach. Enjoy... By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff: At 10:24 p.m. Friday night The Arena crowd of 17965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing their arms extended taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than Joseph.  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep. Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday blanking the Blackhawks 3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28 set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history. The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4 a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history both in 1969 when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals. The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves. This time the Blues held the shots down to 34 and the Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph. Well they touched Joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way. The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen Rich Sutter Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks taking the visitors from Chicago off their game. The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and scorers who made the most of their opportunities. Craig Janney Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored getting one goal in each period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson who scored at 16:44 of the final period. Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling ``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour ``Bell-Four. Bell-Four. They also chanted ``Na na-na-na hey-hey good bye. Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left but the Blues are on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels. The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice. Chicago tried to retaliate but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty. The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low where Joseph's butterfly style is deadly. Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour. Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up. He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58 and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan. The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to Janney who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs. The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues' bench. Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice and Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues' power play but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway point of the period and within three minutes of his return Hull had increased the Blues' lead to 2-0 deflecting in Miller's crisp pass. Try as they might the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph who stopped everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice. Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner's pass. %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%* *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % %     \    ________/                                                   * *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             * *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % %        (___)             BLUES                                       * *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%"

AlsoTCI and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams. -PPV Mark"
"2","The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period but Kevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night. Roster move: Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch. Lines: Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary: Say if anybody from Buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume! The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there... Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick Recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-). The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS. Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point. Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes there was some agonizing and they'd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer. He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it outstanding). Happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus. The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was though and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15. Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander but Soderstrom was all over it. The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1 but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over. But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1 he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom and mistake #2 Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal at 7:48 two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey and 27 straight penalty kills. Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing 5 fighting and 5 for the major 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15 Barnaby only got 5. The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances Audette handed to Ledyard at the point and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break. The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles... That was all in the 2nd shots were 19-7 Sabres. Into the 3rd period and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1 Acton with the puck he dropped to Eklund in the slot and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time. Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net... Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at Hasek and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS. But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4. Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44. Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen 7th of his career 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season. Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4 and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play. Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring shots were 18-13 Buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game. So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season but I don't think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker. A couple misc notes: Forget the Mike Keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year. In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman. The Times of Trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future. Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back he feels he did a good job this year but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

"2","#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd Acquired:	'92-93 trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations Grade:		I (B) It is way too early to tell about Ahola who was acquired probably because the Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here) 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he hasn't been spectacular and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola. #24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th Acquired:	'91-92 trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and 2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:		I (B) I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him but his legs knees et al. are giving out. Nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year which may be Wilson's last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor. #29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		I (C-/D+) It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number but no more than 15) but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team. #38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		I (?) MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad because the Sharks were reluctant to use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little I can't even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills. #41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		I (B+) Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However his size (5' 9 165 lbs.) is of concern and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league. #45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:		I (D+/D) He played all of ~5 games in the league this year but was thoroughly umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season; again it may be a small sample but just as in the case of Kolstad Scremin at age 25 is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre. =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

I don't like to see stickwork but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move (I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of bricks but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm talking about hitting the blades here not the foot).  It also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with helpful diagrams of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who I have a great deal of respect for BTW he's not a big guy but he plays huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-) Barfly"
"2","They're real and they're spectacular the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in consecutive playoff games. If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday I will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Curtis Joseph has been the master of his own domain and the Hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers. Not even Superman could play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his cereal. It's like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the Arena. It was very refreshing to see the Blues double-dip the Hawks. The Hawks goons tried to pick on Hull Janney and Joseph but the Blues checking line nipped those Hawks real well.

"2","It's about time the boys got it together!! They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games. But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a minimum something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!) although I still don't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2. If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3 they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).

As long as the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4) they are still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1) with game 6 to be played at Buffalo.

"2","Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm team the Rochester Amerks on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils every other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse the SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out since we got CBA basketball last night if you can believe it.  I assume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout not ESPN since we are unbelievably usually considered part of the Islanders territory (MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being a solid seven hours plus from Long Island. Does anyone know what GRC is doing besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8 10 and 13?

"2","Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21 1993. The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) Topics ------ Don's Tie Grant Fuhr Penalties Wings vs Leafs Fighting Dale Hunter. Episode Summary --------------- This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.) Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night's games because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr. Don began to praise Fuhr calling him the greatest goalie and said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14 Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs and Don advised Don't Trade Fuhr! Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston it would be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated. The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game where Domi hit a Vancouver player and was given a 2 min. penalty. Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: Its sad what they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed. Next they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto. People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke Wendy for not fighting. However Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either. This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking: It's like college hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made by people who don't know what's going on in hockey. The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger Hunter was taught to play to win which differs from today's idea of just letting kids have fun. At then end of the episode they showed a clip from a coach's corner with the tape on fast forward so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks. Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing not too much humour but some good quotes.

Felix the Cat (Sylverster) Maclean (Daffy Duck) etc. Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players They won in their building we're going to win in ours. Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour which was partly responsible for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour from the series... A hit on Constantinov and a pass to Andrewchuk resulting in a goal. On the game itself the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed however and when the Leafs get a power play Coach Burns tells the Leaf players Don't let them score on you. Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal won that game in overtime despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don thought the high stick was obvious even without the use of instant replay. On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning the series 3-0] Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr. Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his play. Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him by saying that he can't play the way he should because of the league's new rules. This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its all hack and slash. Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the problems. Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray was shown in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article in which Murray makes the following statements: Players don't fight because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator. Instead they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game. Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to smarten up with fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now with no fights someone gets cut every period. Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing but here Don's opinion is supported by Murray. I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10."

No and in fact that was Ferreira's original strategy which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar. >Of course Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal >contributions before he was fired so it's not clear that this would have >been different.  Besides they *were* marginal contributors. Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio which if the rumors I've heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed consensus oriented GM. Imagine for a second where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine hadn't jammed. >With or without Mullen they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good >does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere? Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking but his motivation simply wasn't there and that kind of thing can affect the team. >>An example from this season Skriko was brought in on a trial basis >>but not kept because of his age.

But >>you have to find the right balance. >Right balance for what?  That's the issue. Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go we hadn't yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone like Dean Kolstad but at that point that wasn't the choice. And since the choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter I think the right choice was made for that time period. -- Chuq IMHO Von Rospach ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com Member SFWA =+= Editor OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9) San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

Well partly because I as an ardent fan of both sports would rather see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox). ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part. But it's a bit inaccurate to call us selfish just because we want to watch the watch the game we love. Am I as a baseball fan selfish when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month? I don't think so. While ESPN may have contractual obligations we as their consumers have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us. There's certainly nothing wrong with that. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + Bri Farenell			farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   + + AHL ECAC and Boston Bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey		   + + Adirondack Red Wings Calder Cup Champs: '81  '86  '89  '92	   + + Clarkson Hockey ECAC Tournament Champs: '66  '91  '93		   + + Glens Falls High Hockey NY Division II State Champs: '90  '91       + + AHL fans: join the AHL mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu + ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"

How the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new referee system need to be instituted.  Right now too many of the real goons get away with too much because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond to name a few with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the play.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an improvement. ********************************************************************************Tim Drozinski drozinst@db.erau.edu Chew electric death snarling cur!

The problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* NATIONAL PASTTIME.  BASEBALL is so romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+ BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell the game is going to last 2hrs 45mins so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians fan!  Show the end of what you started then switch!  But then I'm a hockey fan what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport. Jason jae2001@andy.bgsu.edu GO Whalers!  Pick well!"

I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team. I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season and then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own money pool and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h. only to find to my amazement that with absolutely no input the initial team still managed to finsh 79th!  I'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me :) Ciao. Brad Gibson -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brad K.

"2","Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides Pilon??? Once again last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation it was the most inopportune time for a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the blueline Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on the line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series but there must be someone else!!!

"2","YAHOOOOOOOOO! The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec City to play game 5.  BTW final score was Habs 3-Nords 2. The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall (bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd. Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another) and the defense was there to clear any rebounds. This just in ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT. YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

"2","It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight to sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however the Sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem. Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series which seems to be headed for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However an early goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it. The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray Ferraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the 2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7. - Vlad the Impaler"
"2","Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the went to the baseball game.  I too was pissed.  How could they interupt such an important game.  I understand about contracts but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games! Anyway  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyone in the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live in the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?) Telethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game had it been televised would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area since 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.  We are not only being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but we are also being deprived of watching them on TV. PEACE HAMMER"
"2","Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I can't get the BLUES games where I go to school thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of the Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates. His moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud. P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)? Peace Hammer"

"2","Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5000 watt station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England states. This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened 28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay tuned. -PPV Mark"

Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup he simply isn't ready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role which is ALL he really showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass shoot or skate I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist which isn't bad but at the NHL level the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand he's a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth talking about. He got neutralized quickly and stomped on a couple of times. Unless he shows some new tricks in camp he'll be on my career minor leaguer list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL I expect the Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He needs to get stronger he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some versatility as something else than a simply goond because he wasn't particularly good as a goon. -- Chuq IMHO Von Rospach ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com Member SFWA =+= Editor OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9) San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill. >the best of him...he thought the supporting cast in Edmonton >didn't matter...that he was the show himself. How do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only thought that I can see that you have revealed is your own.  You don't like Gretzky. Big deal. >Now my only complaint about Lemieux is that he dives too much... >but last year Patrick convinced him twice to accept Bowman and hockey >destiny rather than his ego. The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  What the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the ref won't be fooled.  I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like Lemieux to change his game.  Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated type like Hull and Salami. -- cordially as always                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca So many morons... rm                                                   ...and so little time."

"2","Caps/Isles Fans Anyone interested in catching the games from Nassau Coliseum (hopefully there will be another) can catch the game at North Carolina's Original Sports Bar in Chapel Hill.  I'm pretty sure they carry HTS as well. They had all three games on at the same time last night.  This is the only place I know to catch all of the Stanley Cup action.

"2","I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However I am going to put an end to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man they are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!"

Well that's really great Pat.  I guess since you've played a little you thereby qualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato > Not that I condone violence but I'll make an exception for Mario. Pat Walker Again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  Truly a stupid statement.  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game. I'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game but he should come to mind when that question is asked.  Let's face it he just returns from radiation therapy with around a dozen games left overtakes Lafontaine for the scoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No I guess he just got lucky. Speaking of Lafontaine now there's a guy who should be considered for the Hart trophy as well certainly one of the better players in the league this year."

"2","I'm a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best I can here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get a reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas. I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy self-serving profiteer or were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging? As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me I can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota unless they truly didn't support the team. Opinions please.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop pass at his own blue line and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one Howald entered the Swedish zone slammed on the breaks and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest periods I've seen Sweden play this year. Second period saw a new Swedish team and the Swiss had to ice the puck many times. On a pp Nylander skated in from the boards Pavoni made the initial save but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal from the Swiss a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4 just before the end of 2nd period on a pp skated in unattacked in front of the goal and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. Third period Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then another defensive mistake by the Swedes Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post and Dineen just deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play goal after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the far post and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov. Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5 and they had the most of the scoring opportunities but they just couldn't score. Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya entered the Russian zone slammed on the break to get past his defenseman then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck. The Russians then finally got their goal Karpov broke in from the side and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner. Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya and for Russia Valeri Karpov. I agree the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya and in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period. Lindros BTW lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player (among those Kariya with 1+6).

If you watch old photos or films let say about ten years back I think the difference is quite obvious. Who is an expert on this please let me know. (Or have the goalies become bigger?)

The post (which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity) was addressed to all.  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will say To: All.  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  That's an entirely different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.

The largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of the Internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point.  And just for my own curiosity I thought I'd look up the official definition of large in the dictionary.  It reads: large - 1.  having more than usual power capacity or scope. 2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size. Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there thereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope. >He might be impressed by the size of the list of names. Why would he be impressed with this unless it were large? I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak. I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I have very mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are and don't think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change. -- Paul W.

Thanks.  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important enough to say something themselves. I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you don't belong to) of a larger group (which you do if only because this isn't a moderated group). Look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three that come to mind are as follows: 1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear. 2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some interesting conversation. 3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out the window. >I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.

He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season - Murray has to sit somebody out though.  If the Red Wings hadn't played as well as they did in the first game he may have been in the second.  Why should Murray juggle players when the Wings are dominating Toronto like they are?"

An agitator for sure but Fleury never has and never will have a fight which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the head. McSorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped Fleury one right between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble. The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning and even then he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-) Alan"

Not always true. In fact in the case of Doug Gilmour he actually praises them. Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids that do them are tough just like a real Canadian. Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter. I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them the more I think he's just an asshole. Alan"

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes. I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary but he might be able to help a team like San Jose with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers and Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his current attitude he is a detriment to the team. Alan"

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart it is far from a no-brainer. The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. Like I said Mario deserves it IMHO. But it is a very close race and a Gilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion but I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs. Alan"

I'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one. But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm to which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom. As far as the arena in general being boring well Richard's got that right. It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At last Tuesday's game I overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist. Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out of this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh. Spoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through that amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for granted.  God look at Chicago... And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can. Mom."

He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec. I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being stupid he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a rock. Also remember that a lot of teh draft 1st stuff comes from the assumption he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status. He's still first round but I don't consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point. It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos suspensions. >IMO I would >take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in >the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team. >San Jose will then get Kariya. No. Kariya won't go in the first three for a very simple reason: he's not leaving college and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two not when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th unless a team can convince him to leave school early (which I doubt). My cut on things as they stand today: >Draft Order >----------- >1) Ottawa (60% Daigle if not 40% Pronger) >2) San Jose 80% Niedermayer unless Ottawa skips Daigle. Then it's open. (it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him.

There's been rumors he was officially released right at the end of the season when his contract expired but I haven't seen confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he wasn't going to make it for a while and the Sharks would have to sign him to a contract which given his problems competing at the IHL level this spring doesn't make sense. -- Chuq IMHO Von Rospach ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com Member SFWA =+= Editor OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9) San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

One of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players to be shown between plays.

"2","I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alright spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience. What Did Blue have going for him nothing What would happen in a Tie game the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face that kind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming that is for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo Boston (except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad   As a believer is statistics you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later just keep shooting.

The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio interview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:) lost.  Vasili the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach) said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after three? seasons). I don't know why. Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team produced many players to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but they had the fighting spirit. After all they butchered Jokerit in the playoffs and gave hard time to TPS the champs. But Assat wasn't consistent only when they were in the right mood they could beat any team in the SM-liiga. I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said he wants to be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and decide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but maybe they'll do some compromise. Could somebody post more information about Vasili? I know he was coaching in the former Soviet league; teams results? His character as a coach?"

While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well I still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr the series would now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres. In both of these games Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres the chance to win. Especially in game 3 Fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0 the score seemed to indicate that the Sabres dominated. However if it hadn't been for Fuhr the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was) through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game).  There is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the victory. In my opinion Neely Oates and Juneau played as well as LaFontaine Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get extraordinary efforts from Hannan Sweeney Wood and Khmylev (compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However the Bruins defense  IMO played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton playing a regular shift afterall ;-) The difference in the series was Fuhr who outplayed Andy Moog. Gary Go Sabres!"

Well as a hockey fan I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say Hey let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one! -- that's fine. It's entirely another to say Okay let's take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it! Of course none of us will ever know the real inside story but from what I know a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10000 level that Green wanted yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse. I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game and the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game the attendance was so full as to have SRO and the whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey USA. How the NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond me. I only hope they get a new team soon.

Is it that the owner is a greedy self-serving profiteer or >were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever >owned the arena doing some price gouging? Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team.  When he bought the team it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red before the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression that he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans despite increasd ticket prices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the other two arenas in town etc. Oh well I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge returns in Dallas and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel Minnesota's was quite reasonable) and he also has some cronies down there as well.  All this means is that Minnesota is without an NHL team for a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL. KEA"

My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the first period and the Leafs none. As well my point isn't that the refs were biased just that they were calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the Wings. Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game. --"

At first I immediately thought 5 and a game because the hit _looked_ much more severe from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay I'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you slice it).  If Stewart had replay I do not think Chaisson would have gotten 5 and the game. >In the second period behind Potvin Probert had the puck and was >going to get out front and was _tackled!_  I couldn't believe the no-call. This no-call was bullshit I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go but Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I've never seen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to).  Now if Probie decides to put Wendel through the boards he's probably gone right? >I don't remember who (on the Leafs) touched the puck >on Racine's shot towards the end of the game (43.2 seconds left) but Stewart >called it out of play last touched by Detroit.

It was Rouse btw. I'm really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call either....it's b.s. when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake. >But when it all comes down to it [Wings played like shit.....] Yes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit loss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin but the Wings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team. The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his stick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an asshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. Murray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out of him. -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca"

Scoring for the Canadians were Kevin Dineen of the Flyers Eric Lindros also of the Flyers and Paul Cariya of the Maine Black Bears. Cariya has put on quite a show at the Worlds. He is sure to be drafted in the top 3 this summer at the NHL entry draft. Canada defeated Italy 11-2 and Austria 11-0 before meeting the Russians on Sunday.

"2","How did the Leafs turn it around??? I couldn't get the Leaf games on the weekend in CA. Did the Leaf defense wise up overnight? Did the Leafs get in the slot or was it just fluke goals in a goalie duel? Did the Wings turn off the jets or muscle? What gives here? I caught game 1 on satellite.  I figured my Leafs were washed. This is a _major_ turnaround.   Very few predicted this. How how how did it happen? Wing and Leaf perspectives welcomed! -jake."

"2","Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky too. In the third period Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound the time was around 5 mins or so. The second goal was scored by Kari Harila who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu the 18-year-old center got his first point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. I think that we will hear from this guy in the future."

"2","News: ===== For the first time all season the Flames are now injury-free. The only player remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who even when healthy is not a major part of the team. Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game and has also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. Thoughts on Game 1: ================== The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings but that was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky Kings goaltending but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds. In fact Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. Thoughts on Game 2: ================== The Flames came back strong in the second game evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice. The first period was fairly even with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1 but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when they needed it most in the 1st and 2nd periods. The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First Craig Berube of Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed 30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major minor and game misconduct for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil turtling amounted to fighting but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

What was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now >Northlands sucking the blood out of the Oilers franchise. The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses. >The Oilers have paid several times over what the Coliseum cost to >build and bring Edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the >world that is essentially priceless...to nickel-and-dime the Oilers >just so Northlands can use revenue sucked out of the Oilers to >subsidize their horse-racing operations is insanity. I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization. I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has sucked revenue out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests. Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship. As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks. -- cordially as always                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca So many morons... rm                                                 ...and so little time."
"2","(Detroit April 21) Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit Red Wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to another easy victory over the best team in the NHL. For the best goaltender in the world Felix Potvin six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team. Alan P.S. We told you this would happen Roger. Didn't we? I love it....."

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's I'd be thanking Stewart for calling as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay. Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four perhaps five were quite stoppable. Alan"

As long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and Andersson to report to Binghampton. It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger organization however.

Is this >trend continuning? This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games and it saves us Caps fans a lot of pain. I mean it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1 watching them tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times have they done that in their history? 1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles lost 3 straight 1987 up 3-1 against the Isles lost 3 straight 1992 up 3-1 against the Pens lost 3 straight In other words when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go they were a pitiful 2-9 the lone wins being 1) a sweep of Philly in 1984 2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals the ONLY TIME they managed to get out of the division. Actually Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples: 1) game 4 against the Isles 1985 led 4-2 after two lead series 2-1 gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period including the game winning goal in the last minute. After that goal Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot. Series tied 2-2 lost game 5 a few days later. 2) game 4 against the Rangers 1986 led series 2-1 led by 2 in the 3rd period blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games. 3) game 6 against Pittsurgh 1992 led series 3-2 led by 2 in 2nd period. Blew it and the series. 4) game 3 against Isles 1993 series tied 1-1 led by 2 after 2. Blew it. 5) game 4 against Isles 1993 trailed series 2-1 led by 3 in 2nd period. Blew it again. When they were leading by 3 in game 4 I said to myself: if they blew this lead the series is OVER. They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders believe they can come back no matter what the score is. I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team who can completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear lives in a crucial game. >The Admiral a hopeless Caps fan. >P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh! Well some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders I was thinking wait until Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire. Well they retired (even though Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform) yet another generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well I guess it has nothing to do with the players. -- Edward Lor lor@cbnewsk.att.com"

"2","Hi guys.... What happened? 1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by. 2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up. 3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs the emotional edge. 4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs. A couple of comments: 1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth place....plus he walked away with the Molson cup (given for accumulating points from the three star selection) during the regular season. 2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever missed that slash on Gilmour's hand). 3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the division). Problem is I like both these teams though I'm supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not playing aggressive hockey.... By the way....I'm not any sort of expert nor do I claim to be. I just like watching a good matchup. tee hee hee...ooops! Susan"

The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think in terms of who was the best player rather in terms of who was the most valuable to the team.  And valuable to his team was not and should not be considered synonymous with best.  We are talking about a time when honour and attitude not measurable skills were the most important assets a player brought to his team his league and his sport.  This was before the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory. The Hart Trophy is not a prize.

"2","While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do. Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled. As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks without a doubt. One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks looking for reasons to give them penalties.  Second The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman no shot for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis' goals Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn't belong in the crease which means it was a St. Louis player. Finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie no way to stop the shot. I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack. ____________________________________________________________________________ |The World Reknown Jason Boskey           | Mail: Bosk@uiuc.edu            | |Known throughout the World as The Bosk   |Christ you know it ain't easy| |All Rights Reserved All Lefts Enhanced  |You know how hard it can be    | |-----------------------------------------|The way things are goin'        | |Here they come spinning out of the turn|They're gonna crucify me       | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

As far as Cheveldae is concerned he is a decent goalie.  The most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sure if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his roots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the Rangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play."

I think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did they're playing too tight!!  Who's responsibility is it to check Mogilny?  He has gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds which are not being cleared by the B's defense.  It's too bad the B's might not get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again.  I would really enjoy seeing Ulfie get beat up by Neely.  We all hate Ulfie but would love him on are team!!"

"2","There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team. When I visit PIttsburgh I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have done in recent years I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste my money on mediocre teams. -P{ravin Ratnam"

"2","Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list: In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch the subject of Springfield's 1st round upset of the Providence Bruins came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL. Furthermore he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup finals between Roch and Spring that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office and that: ...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and staff attending all games with the Springfield brass including sitting in their box for the game in Springfield and according to the Rochester media openly cheering for Springfield. Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the Wings before) but if true this is somthing that seriously raises questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.

If you had the situation that Abe had would you move if you were guaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to park at the stadium because there has been nothing within a half mile until the recent construction in the area. Can they win a game in OT again. Rich -- You've read the hat now see the movie. -Imus in the morning A blurb? You're a blurb! -Seinfeld"

If the team can rally around him maybe Moog can too. He got the start but the headlines on all Boston local TV sportscats said it all : Sutter Blue It!. And he did.

I know the score but that rarely describes the game. >Could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened.  How well >did each team play?  Were the cannucks deserving of the victory? Well in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he could be a key to success for them this year.  Defensively they really had a strong game.  Hardly heard Selanne's name all night. Craven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a few exceptions they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much high-flying.  I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the Canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series. In short it was a great start! -- Chris Roney  (e-mail chris_roney@sfu.ca)"
"2","The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2. The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the numbers that counted: goals. Vancouver's big line produced again with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals. However as in the first game the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. The hard work paid off late in the second when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2-1. Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays. Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably. McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone. The Canucks on the other hand looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead. A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2. The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off. This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported. However as in the first and second Canuck goals a Jet defensive lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure who had been invisible in the game up to that point took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance. By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack. Canucks 3 Winnipeg 2. Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games. - 30 -"

Fine.  I really don't care enough about the name change to care.  Your name isn't attached to it so why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading well you're free to feel that way and take exception but manners never hurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine (I have the right to think and say that too).  Ali's under no compunction to change a single word.  Now while you're free to disagree with every word she wrote to tear apart her character is uncalled for.  I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you tear down Ali's integrity and character publicly you'll get chastised publicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say Ali please be a bit more specific in your description the way I've read it indicates you're stating my view also and that's simply not true. I'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean the entire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it despite your intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as always &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of myself and possibly others.
