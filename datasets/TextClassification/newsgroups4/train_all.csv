But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my system but on 5.25 disks.  I hate using 5.25 disks so I copied them over to high density 3.5's using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In fact for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer when you're switching printer emulations around. Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with but when a friend's system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the originals and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton c:\nu would create a workable backup and if you did a full install the first time you've got the whole thing.

Thanks. A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible however to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip also available on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the normal keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

Gawd it's only been two and half years. How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck??? Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed?

"1","I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB. When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 everything is fine but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows AutoCAD GIFs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4 bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back this is a pain in the ass and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So if anyone has had this same problem please let me know if you know what to do.  Hell let me know if you don't have a solution just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance. Jude M. Greer jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen it just starts to cut off the top and bottom."

"1","Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in. Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it. It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then maps the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can cd to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor! So I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-) John -- John Gayman WA3WBU UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH"

At least : locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and : he has to fix it. Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell.

Kinda fun.  8) First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom. Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 If the last 3 digits are 013 you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (- represents jumper) >	W1	1-2 3 >       W2      1-2 3 >	W3	1-2 >	W4	1 2-3 >	W5	1 2 3 >	W6	1-2 3 >	W7	1 2 3 Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: (8 represents jumper) Looks right. [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other? I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom set it like this: 5 + +    open 6 + +    open 7 + +    open 8 + +    open 4 + +    closed 3 + +    closed 2 + +    open 1 + +    open Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 34 and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 12 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1). If you have the 62-000094 rom it's a auto-config and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here. >2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly? See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also  at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251 try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade? Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter: -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt) This will return the rom date if it's of any use. >Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above I appologize.

WD1004A-27X feature F300R - Half-slot size hard disk controller  with an ST506/ST412 interface.  It supports 2 RLL drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built-in ROM BIOS supports non-standard drive types virtual drive formatting bad track formatting and dynamic formatting. NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not boot.  To solve this problem one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using). -2- NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1 WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers models SX TX and the original or A version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5 the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the modification a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

"1","Help.... I need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3 and COM4. I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4 shares IRQ3 with COM2 except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how. Please answer by email to :- neil@stone.oz.au thanks in advance Neil Watkinson."

"1","Hi All I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters et.c. Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non-trivial data to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off typeamatic specs.) from inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above which wouldn't look too neat besides what would one do from an XT?) Great thanks in advance Andrew."

"1","Please help if you can with the following strange problem: The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to time for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or something the like). Unfortunately I cannot just reproduce the error. Sometimes it occurs more often sometimes less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to demonstrate some software to a colleague. I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it.

"1","Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer configuration is : 486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz) 16MB Ram ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk SCSI UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk performance in that system do I need that ? A guy I know gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec and he has an ST3283A and a ISA 486DX-50 how can a ISA with the same system be faster ? Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?

If you are considering buying one or the other definitely go for the DX with a nice size external cache!  The performance is far greater. The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz while the DX has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither systems could actually run a program out of main memory since DRAM is still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ). -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I can tell you that mixing them between 'banks' ok and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ) here is the two equivalent configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM interface they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry if too techie for ya]. MG>> 	Similarly one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots) can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ?? That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit wide SIMMs you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask? Simple  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit CPU ( 386DX or 486 ) the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data from memory ) is 32-bits wide so the computer expects to see 32 bits when it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ) the motherboard links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data but parity so I will ignore that in this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you have a 16-bit bus two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide data which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide and 32-bit banks are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bits used in some PS/2s and ASTs ) you could upgrade by one SIMM at a time. Hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your question was not simple.  I could of just said 'because I said so.' -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean cache speed is one thing but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O so just get that faster... I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)! regards JV ///// name:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ] address: gildelaar 4                                            \_=_/ 4847 hw teteringen                                     _| |_ holland                  e-mail:  volkert@kub.nl      / \_/ \ _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__"

No rumour IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last fall (COMDEX or something I wasn't there). All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU just like 486SX that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel don't you? It has 16K of internal cache which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99 but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software"

Try another vendor I wish I had. While others here may have had better experiences I too share the sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM it is only relatively recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing mis-drawn check boxes etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01. If there's a more recent release I'd appreciate if someone would drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their BBS lately to check again.  Naturally Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases. Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the right person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not confirmed the validity of that statement. When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some form of local bus) I'll seek a video solution from someone other than Diamond.

"1","Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS using C++ to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085. I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character if a 0x20 is received the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17 monitors (also a newly available) and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board. Do not buy a 486SX sytem. My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models. Gordon"

"1","Howdy Sorry if this has been covered before: One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course I said No problem and went to work. Unfortunately the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC)... Thanks in advance Paul Mr. SCSI... NOT! Fincke"
"1","I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am running Linux as my main OS with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games. My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS and (120+100)Mbyte IDE. Basically I have two choices 1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486. Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25. I have a couple of questions. 1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS and alot of Floating Point operations. 2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ? Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? Any experiences will be most helpful ... Kenny. PS.

Does he have to use new parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? When it comes to local dealers: - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their techs are re-treaded salesmen not trained technicians with a high turnover rate. - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously. - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply or even done period unless you are on a paid service contract. Having been both a service technician and a service manager at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place I know what I'm talking about. I also know the local service scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service. Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service including overnight replacement parts on-site calls etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good service you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can. - Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)"

Some background about my PC: - American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM - config.sys file: device=c:\dos\himem.sys dos=highumb device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems files=30 buffers=30 stack=9256 - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c - CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram. The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31 I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. Run excel no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows. Ok I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them: - Stack fault by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure by ndw.exe at same address Some how the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means? I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat no help. Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. -------------- Steve Chu AT&T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ"

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use slower RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash. Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM. Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of Illinois Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set. Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels? If you have not yet open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base. As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker? Anyhow If the tape has the holes then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape. If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out. If it is still in warranty you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair. --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil Standard disclaimer: The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

No help there. Then not having anything better to try I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards. I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila! the PC booted from power up although it seemed to take several seconds before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns. O.K. with this additional information does anyone in netland have any words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it? -Larry still (un)plugging away Byler-"

"1","Hello I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have 8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie. both banks are full and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows and I know that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS the only solution I can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180 and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather avoid... So my question is do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work how do they do it?  Is a device driver needed or will the BIOS pickup the extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits so probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly appreciated. -Eric ebosco@us.oracle.com"

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for! V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster. This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory. Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other two. How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.

If we are >only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently >faster at managing data from a hard drive. You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only} some monitors and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports. IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max. So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost} SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put."

It must be able to run Unix. What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a quality stuff? What are other important features ? Monitor: I want a 14 non interlaced svga but not sure about what brand to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider? Acer? Touch? What else should I ask? Video Card: I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of V-RAM? One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal? Hard Drive: Segate Western Digital Conner all have the same price. Which one is more liable? which one has better performace? Case/power supply: Given the choise of desktop and minitower which one is better? What is the adequate power supply? Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue? What features should I ask for? Did I miss anything? I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group. Your help is greatly appreciated. Jason Chen"

"1","I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well and is working fine but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup. The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0 The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head 300 write_pre 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally the drive in the machine had none.  Currently I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave. When booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error. Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive I would not even know how to do that. Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not a number for Western Digital might just do as good! swood -- Hunting over in Michigan?

The scenario: 1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller 2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy) 3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy) 4 - Call Gateway receive the correct controller in 5 days (getting happier) 5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again) 6 - Call Gateway again get another controller in 5 more days (cooling off the end is in sight) 7 - This controller doesn't work either motherboard is bad (VERY unhappy) Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) and have on-site service install it for me. BUT I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So the whole thing is going back. I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer. I would really like to try Gateway again I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?

"1","Hello I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec 1542A controller. Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located. Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system' even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).

Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software. Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS and later Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x the number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc. Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore IBM is including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1). Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2. So far IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read comp.os.os2.misc for details). Proposed Charters: (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and spur additional development.  The group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS Windows UNIX etc) toolkits which aid in program portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors) and so forth. (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting. (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics including the availability of device drivers compatibility information installation procedures system requirements and overall performance optimization. (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues. (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports bug diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system patches and corrective service disks and so forth. [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other newsgroups and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in comp.os.os2.beta] How to Vote: To cast your vote fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me. Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this post.  Be sure to send only the ballot and edit out the rest of this post. 1)  Type in your vote for each proposal: If you favor the charter as proposed put a yes after its name. If you oppose the charter as proposed put a no after its name. To abstain leave a blank after its name. 2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name) a comma and your first name (i.e. your personal name). 3)  Cut out the ballot  Please do not delete any lines of the ballot. 4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) April 24 1993. Ballot: ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---- (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: (f)       voter's last first name: e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24 ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---------------- Example Ballot #1: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no (f)       voter's last first name: Smith John In this example John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting to be created and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. Example Ballot #2: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes (f)       voter's last first name: Doe Jane In this example Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all the proposals. Voting Rules: * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once only the most recent vote will be counted. * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting forwarding posting votes to a newsgroup etc. will not be counted. * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings will be revealed only after the poll closes. * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will post the ACK twice (see Schedule below). * If you need help for using your editor using e-mail how voting works in general etc. then ask an expert at your site. Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is posted to news.answers on a regular basis. * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this CFV send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu. * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below) a proposal passes if both of the following formulas are true: 1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100 or YES - NO >= 100). 2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO or YES - NO >= NO). In other words a proposal passes if: YES - NO >= max (100 NO) where max() returns the highest number given to it. Schedule: The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator). This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV but it also has the Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you have not voted yet vote now! The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) on April 24 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count. The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that date. Mass Acknowledgement: Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15 1993: bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari Sanjay

"1","Hi I just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy.  This thing has every port known to man on the back. The question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC. What hardware is needed? Software? TIA Alex P.S. please respond directly.  I am not on this alias."
"1","I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced which seems like a good deal. However it is a fixed-scan rate monitor and only handles 52 kHz horizontal I think.

"1","While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts I found a half-size board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC and ran Advanced diagnostics several times changing the jumper positions each time but the system did not recognise a comm port. Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it? I could use another comm port if it's free. Bryan"

"1","Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say Buy the memory from us or something like that.) The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects. So to get to the point finally ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken. If you want these modes steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB) at least until their developers are less busy.  If the magazines are to believed I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?) although evenn that might be a misprint. Please if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL. Thanks. donyee@athena.mit.edu"

"1","> My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ 5 which is > unreserved in contemporary computers (using IRQ 5 for the > drives went out with the XT architechture ... ) Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt. On the other hand we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1 a Mouse on COM2 and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5 and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3 our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work. ~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)"

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.

"1","This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard. I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr 7 days/wk) and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company. I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc. Thanks very much in advance for any information. -- Mohammad Al-Ansari"

You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me believing that the 250 logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity. The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it marketing.

This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours particularly if the tape is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for the write is too small.

This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration file for the tape system.

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE inteface for any non-card non-modem not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross drive interfacing as fast as the OS program CPU SCSI and drive can handle it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}. In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well. Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers scanners expandsion cards {this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'} CD-ROM etc. IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface {Make of that what you will} SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE. This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water. Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago {When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI off into the statosphere price wise} SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces {at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}"

"1","Hi I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive. I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE drive. I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any mention of it in the manuals. My system config is: i486DX/33 4Mb Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE Any help would be appreciated Thanks Ron.

"1","It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick. I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features. For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy. Just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up down left etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know much beyond that. -- Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality Winnipeg MB Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinks chrstie@ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant. |  they're useful to society"

However just in case something went wrong I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly. * MSDOS configuration: The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive (this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up. * Windows configuration: To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows make sure that the [388Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry: VirtualHDIRQ=Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you you might want to try adding some more lines: VirtualHDIRQ=Off SystemROMBreakPoint=false EMMExclude=A000-CFFF (You probably don't need the above lines though.)  The SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs). * Windows 3.1 runs slowly: Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542 chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not it's probably because: 1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a winning solution. 2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen .... If your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 (SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS) you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other solutions. Unfortunately you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following: 1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by a bug in Smartdrive. 2. Use a driver that provides VDS services (VDS stands for Virtual DMA Services).  This is a standard which is supported by Windows 3.1 that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like the 1542) to work with Windows. After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following solutions none of which require using Smartdrive (note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster: 1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver or you do not need ASPI functions (for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc.) you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 (Windows needs the /V386 option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory) and it occupies about 16-20K.  As of November 1992 the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully it's still there). 2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver version 3.0 or 3.0a you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 Amazingly enough the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support about this and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW. On my system NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE the default Windows shell and vice-versa.  This is the reason SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary. I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0. Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider these people lucky.  Others like me have had all sorts of problems. 3. In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer needed.  Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know there are only three ways to get a copy: * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other drivers such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is around $75. * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around $30. * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1. Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem. ***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices: There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250: 1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc. 2. Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors. (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542.) * Tape backups/restores take a long time: If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 bus on/off timing for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause.  However the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary. The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is too large.  For example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory) not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough. The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on and 5 microseconds off. The bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways: * If you have ASPI4DOS you can use the /n option.  For example I use a bus on timing of 4 microseconds which means that I use the following line in my CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4 Note that there is NO space between the /n and the 4. * If you don't have ASPI4DOS your only recourse is to try to find a program called SETSCSI.EXE which is very difficult to find.  The reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have it.  If you do find a copy you run it like so: setscsi -n:4 This adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds.  Running SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults. Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS however. Do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little. Once you've lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster. Also do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described) unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh. A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while) this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However when I tried running this program with my 1542A my system crashed.  At the time I was running SCSIHA.SYS and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B although the docs say that it works with the 1542A? * Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors: This problem may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542. Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head: 1. Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup. 2. Tape backup works but the tape compare fails. 3. The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc. much too often. Unlike the above-mentioned problem (Tape backups/restores take a long time) where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so. 4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the tape drive but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot. 5. Too many tape read errors. Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago I upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542 I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive. I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542 which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542.  On the other hand the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542.  I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however if you're having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller. ***** Sound cards: Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error.  Usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware. I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g. higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using 16-bits instead of 8 etc.). Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's bus on timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note however that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e. some software is inefficient).  Disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this. ***** Miscellaneous info: This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk. * With QEMM 6.00 6.01 and 6.02 you need to specify the DB= parameter (e.g. DB=2) unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver. If you don't QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line (at least this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter but I'm not sure (I've never used a version earlier than 6.00). If you use ASPI4DOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB= parameter. * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB you need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec. * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542 you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package which lists for something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you need. 2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc.  I do not know the list price but I've seen this package sold for around $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS driver which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead. 3. [This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit but I'm mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver) if it is not included in the ASW-410 kit but this is available from several bulletin boards. * To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542 you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are (again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup. 2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more details).  However note that CorelSCSI! does not come with but requires ASPI4DOS. * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations: 1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS. 2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers. 3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and CorelSCSI! drivers/programs. I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration: 4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI drivers). * Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used this version of GNU tar but I've heard that it works (I don't know how well though).

However the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical and there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work with a 1542A but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of BSD Unix). * In case anyone's curious here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file: FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGHUMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.

"1","I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more you now get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago when I bought this pkg. it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos."

XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think).

"1","I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system: 486-33 DX 16 mb of ram on a Novell 3.11 network Monitor:  NEC 4FGe capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate Major considerations: I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word processing database and communications--not much intensive graphics. With a 15 monitor I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256 colors seems plenty but I'd like like the image to be sharp fast and rock solid. Other considerations: I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers. I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking. I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later).

Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning (the problem I had) others poor focus etc etc. I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. It's now clear well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly a Trinitron (say) would be much nicer but that's well out of my price range. Conclusion: If you're on a budget get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it but has good potential. Chris"

"1","------------------------------------------------------------------------- Netters! I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's but that's not really relevant at the moment. I've been offered the following CD-ROM players for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor please give your opinions on the drives i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq. I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

"1","I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4). Well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters. What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? -- ............................................................... :      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : : Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              : : Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park NC : ..............................................................."

Several others here also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate appears ok for me but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of spending money with the size of today's files etc a tape backup is certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost."

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find corrupted files but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? As might be expected I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything (and hoping that will fix the problem) but I would like to have some assurance of what the problem cause is. Also can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)?

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}. The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices slower through put} From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for 20% faster then IDE that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1 far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip. The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the 20% faster then IDE came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port electronic controller etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes. When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }"

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed 20% faster than IDE {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)} Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip {Not at a 6MB/s 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}. Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on. One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is (Digital Review Oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))."

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? : If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think) but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS. The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient. We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though). I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several. Gordon Lang"
"1","I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future Domain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller. The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices). The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found. The system hangs if all three (Tandberg Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system. Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.

I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many things about pc in general. So what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ? I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256 colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes. Any suggestion ?? thankyou in advance Paolo Silvera -- Certified Commodore Amiga developer silvera@ghost.sm.dsi.unimi.it"

"1","I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17 Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results. In going with the modern trend the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia though which the S3 cards just printed as hash which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported. The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic' and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either. The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386 ISA so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486 33 MHz AIR motherboard (UMC chipset) with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit. K means thousand (not 1024) M means million pixels per second Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me.... I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my company. geoff sherwood"

"1","Hi Netters! I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario: 1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive). The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / restore program.  Both systems have 3.5 and 5.25 floppies. 2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon). From what I have seen so far there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these options I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y etc.) in my thinking (I don't know very much about these beasts): 1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system. Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand? What do the floppies themselves cost? 2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again can someone recommend a few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)? 3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?) 4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again any gotcha's or recommendations for manufacturers? I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.

You send a command to the port to read it then you time how long it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously since time is used as a position you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste of time.

At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver. So should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number? Any assistance appreciated.

"1","Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again I forget the model number but I can find out.) Anyway I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected) but not both at the same time; whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master the new 210MB one is the slave). The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations: controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave None of them worked.  Unfortunately I can't think of any others. Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C: drive and D: drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things? So I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost! Many many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!

"1","Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up. Previously when I first start up my PC I can see all the CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again the display works as normal like before. Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet. I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.

My 2 cents worth: The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. A speaker being a coil it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach. Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard. LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light power off reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work. If it does then attach the turbo switch to the board. Hope this helps. Dan Moyer Dan.Moyer@ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM"

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something much more elementary. Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and an initial directory. If you have a small disk (50 meg or less) I would recommend that it remain a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

No that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper. : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.

No actually we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.

On a single drive SCSI is more expensive.  But you bought your PC for expandibility so you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE: A (partial?) list: 1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently. 2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) 3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For instance recently I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will work no other way.  On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes. 4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once. One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full but it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card. Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE.

Anyway he now he would like to put another HD into this system.  I DON'T want to buy another MFM the only reason why I used an MFM in the first place is that it was FREE.  Would I need a special IDE HD controller?  Also if I do need a special IDE controller where can I purchase one & how much are they?

If the keyboard is left idle in Dos for more than 15 minutes I can type on the command line but as soon as I hit a carraige return the computer locks up.  This will happen almost every time whether I've just booted up reset or finished using a dos program.  Everything works fine if I don't let it sit.  Windows is a different story.  If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes or more it does not freeze up.  However  I do get frequent application errors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly losing my work.

"1","I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k ( v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem at the other machine is a Turbomodem+ from The Complete PC (the machines are in seperate houses so a direct serial link is impossible and copying this much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines on for a few hours and go see a movie--no this is not pirated software). I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to set the comm at 19k2 38.4k or 56kbps the stupid thing connects but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k). His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART so that's not the problem. It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to a comm program _at_ 14.400bps even though it will take dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK etc. to other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can do precisely 14.4k. I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it any way in particular? Also it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting here (i.e. at 9600 since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far) but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.

(at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms. Is there any argument that IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. If data is going from one drive to another and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?

If they had a common (read: >easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or >Mac) then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice. So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice. >: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented >: data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better >: (than IDE on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when >: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. > >On a single drive SCSI is more expensive.

(jumpers set IRQ 14/15 hw port addr 1F0/170 and BIOS addr CC00/C800 and other floppy/format stuff) Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI or even from HD is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - ---  --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron and can change a chip or put a jumper!

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents... The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems. A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or at least do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group. Its a long story but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines.  If and when SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines I plan to completely get rid of IDE. -- Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best. Palm Bay FL.

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it but DOS (at least) won't.

Since my budget is $2350 for a system it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it IS too good to be true of course). Among other things I've never seen a review of the Budget systems (or their parent company Micro Smart) or of the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be appreciated. In a similar vein the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14 MI monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well. Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities. Email response would be greatly appreciated.

This is what all this is about.  Do you >get more performance for the money. Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: >IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s. Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower {Range 0-5MB/s} >ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {}) PC Magazine April 27 1993:29 Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE... {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI one third the speed of IDE... or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI 20% faster than IDE... NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity. SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)} If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2} IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE."

The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives and monitor.  The floppies are 360k and the monitor is CGA but you will need an adaptor cable to use it.

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk and REM out the Adaptec drivers. Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work. Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun. The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

"1","Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5. (The card is revision 5A) My detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part of the ISA bus. The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X what does the manual claim that this jumper does? To anyone with an ISA-reference what is the function of the BALE line? On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?

I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor.

If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only work as the first or second drive.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I have seen a similar situation before.

Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will > allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts? Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software) COM1 on IRQ3 SoundBlaster on IRQ5 LPT1 on IRQ7 and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great. If you need even more there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus. It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the first IRQ serviced by the system giving the modem a better response -- especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

With I/O overlap your CPU can continue to think while disk operations are underway whereas without overlap your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity* compared to a fast CPU. So when you've got multi-tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do. One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes with no DMA. -- Richard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along..."

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence IDE *is* ISA on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock 16 bit width 5MB/sec. This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way then it's not compatible.

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned they are adjusted to factory-spec before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15 monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps rough handling and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor (the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my case quite :). >Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? I for one was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect IMHO but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was normal). The short answer is no don't accept these imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors one has a right to expect higher quality and if you're persistent you'll receive it. >............................................................... >:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : >: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              : >: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park NC : >...............................................................

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from? SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip the port and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point. SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY} asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s} synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.} SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s} SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external device. Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2. Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst. SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this requires: SCSI-2 driver software wide SCSI-2 port and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software the controler chip and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}"

"1","Hi I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone claims..) Anyway.. 1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use.. 2) Secondly does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ?? 3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8) 4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... For instance using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary... I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll suspect not .. 5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant?????? As a follow on does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls 0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to screen memory in terms of portability? Many thanks.. Gotta go bars closing soon 8) Cheers Ian"
"1","Fellow netters I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices. Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also. Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE. I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149). Basically I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy? If you have a hand scanner please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. - Kevin Harter"

Reamy (mreamy@rock.concert.net) >The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon. One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao the F550iW which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows I reviewed several monitors including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi and it scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect. Incidentally one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product whether it's monitors or mice is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done and on what the scores are based you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring. Wayne Rash"

There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems so you'll have to get it from someone else. However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know the speed buffering works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board. Hope this helps...

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time. Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense."

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways so there probably isin't a problem with this) Besides like I said before the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2.

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very poorly written.

Very possibly but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is. From what I've seen the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz intelligent bus (ie bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like not jumpers...)

"1","Greetings Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension) and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386. The station has a power supply two floppy disk drives and the big case. I have SONY 1304 monitor SyQuest drive (Mac) and maybe a cd-rom reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW I need to buy a keyboard for it too. Any input is welcome. Thank you. Peter Liu"

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called. Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock). Mark Aitchison University of Canterbury."
"1","Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and pronounced the disk drive unusable. My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders 9 sides). When CMOS set this way COMPSURF runs happily with 13 bad blocks. I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive. Install will proceed successfully but when I try to boot the server it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware. Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit). Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors. Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk yes? So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured? 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides. Thanks for your time. Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before.

"1",">How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus? By initiating a DMA xfer.  :) Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower). ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or crash.(I forget) Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit. The system uses DMA 0 a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1. I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA. In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers. I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either. I do know that on EISA/MCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel. Thanks."
"1","They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use IRQ7!. The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7 then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7. Note this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!. Windows may be a different story...."

"1","Hai In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard. It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is. I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around. My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it so I consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things: - How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2 Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example) - What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it support (text & graphics) - How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM - Compatibility with old TSENG 4000 - Support in software If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell me about it. For the people in Holland: Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam! Thanks in advance			Erik Stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)"

Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day. You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips memory etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save a few cents here and there in electricity bills but it won't look like much when it come time to fix your computer. My $.02 worth.. N. Ngo"

"1","Hi all I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is: * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD * SCSI(2) Interface * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B * Does not need any caddies * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible) * Double Speeded I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions are sorted by my priority. I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive but it DOES satisfy almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible with 1542B adapter. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance KobayashiMasaoki (masaoki@tky.hp.com)"

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance I'll be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards arrive I'll buy one. >Personally my system at home needs a new disk subsystem a much >larger monitor a super-fast graphics board by you-know-who a new >CPU board -- I probably won't keep much more than the case and the >mouse.

My case has slots for 8 and I'd like to : get a scanner but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out! : I'm hoping that a simple solution exists e.g. an adapter that turns I'm not sure if this will work but how about using one of those 'T' expanders used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot and then (probably) have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low profile cases - a standard motherboard the 'T' connector in one slot and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more. The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics on it.  The only downside - your case won't close but for a homebrew system that may not be a problem. Don't know about performance though.

"1","Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine and very nice it is too. One query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz - thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its 7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button that turns it into a skateboard. Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of turbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of about 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.

I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed. I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem as though it's cranking along at much more than that but I also don't know if I could tell the difference.

It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec. I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM RLL and IDE drives because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives much more than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST-01/02."

Yeah there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA XT ISA and now even MCA but at all times it was a 16 bit standard running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI ESDI whatever none of them run at CPU speed. The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much much better to get a software disk cache instead since you get write-caching as well. >because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

"1","I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation is no help at all. As an example it says 'The serial port can be changed to COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-( There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G The second bank is labeled IRQ and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the G enables the game port and the S2 SHOULD enable the second serial port but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports but I don;t know how.

I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory and I noted the following memory timings on my machine: ASQ v1.30 by Qualitas  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  Mon Apr 19 1993  11:43:49AM    page: 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCESS TIMING Hex     KB     KB   Access Speed Ratio (%) Start  Start   Size  Time us 0   25   50  75  100 00000      0     32      396 ****************** 00800     32     32      598 ***************** 01000     64     32      157 ******************** 01800     96     32      180 ******************** 02000    128     64      157 ******************** 03000    192     32      165 ******************** 03800    224    128      156 ******************** 05800    352     96      169 ******************** 07000    448     32      153 ******************** 07800    480     32      188 ******************** 08000    512     96      158 ******************** 09800    608     32      171 ******************** 0A000    640     96     1221 ************** 0B800    736     32     1581 ************ 0C000    768     32      312 ******************* 0C800    800     96      154 ******************** 0E000    896     64     3957 * 0F000    960     64      312 ******************* Note two things on this chart: 1) The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than system memory.

Here's the deal:  The thing works fine!  It low level formats etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN... (Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes. Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: Ok NDD's just not being thurough enough I'll use Spinrite I heard that works well. What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!! AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while only to return in a day or so. I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD and I really can't afford it. I'm using SMARTDRIVE and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access though I know that can create problems).

Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.

Nowhere do I see anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual: Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of 3.75 MB/s maximum 1.87MB/s minimum.  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87 sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside) Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected 'on-the-fly' in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.  (I take this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck) For page-mode operations the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching I guess you could call that a cache :-|). So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec??? Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com. > which one is better? mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same. When I ran dos I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6 this advantage is gone because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put device=pf.sys in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and such also if that is of any value to you.

"1","Hi Netters As promised here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ) so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. However it seems that at $39.95 it is quite a buy. Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance. Here is my suggestion... 1)  If you do not have any compression software currently I would go with DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS) plus the other utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides you are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...) 2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do) the cost is $29.95 for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net I decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It works great.  Not delays.  I think the A is better than B arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. I am looking forward to being able to LOADHIGH the DD sw.  That has been an annoyance. 3)  If you have Stacker et.al. currently I would not see it worth the effort to upgrade. Just my $.02 ... Regards Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was in my opinion easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly. There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such). I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper. -Bruce -- Bruce F.

Software Technical Support Engineer |               Sam Gamgee Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.   |      <My mail My Opinions> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on a 486DX 33Mhz 120MB Seagate drive running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced mode. I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files. If you have any more specific questions let me know.

(if you are familiar with Insight you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms) but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah yes one of the drawbacks of OEM!). Other questions: - Excuse my ignorance but is Texel a reputable maker in the CD-ROM market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive? - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently $449 for the TA-1000 and $699 for the TA-2000) Alternatively I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however I *do* want full multimedia capabilities Photo CD stuff educational programs for my kids etc.) and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful like a tape back-up drive unit.

"1","[] These LPT1 COM1 disk controller are call devices.  There are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership eg. disk controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership ie. it will share an interrupt with another device eg. LPT1 No.  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7 then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's because they're implemented by a single card. -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)"

Higher vertical resolution >was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have >and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8 and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested though take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file run the P9000 installation program INST and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514 as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists etc. >Interestingly the solid >vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie >filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the Bart Simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.

"1","Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it was version 1.5 build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!). One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now and I have tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said: Well Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.  Anyway I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

"1","Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems: 1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations: a) Under NDW when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an Open menu) and then is deselected a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be. b) With Word for Windows when you use shading in a table the display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example if you shade the cell as 10% the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command) and the debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed to do). The screen goes haywire and is largely unreadable. The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled. Through trial and error I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter R. This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen and it does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this. The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode. The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). --- swh 20apr93"

(Well you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies but don't count on be able to do so!)

"1","I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm hoping someone knows what this board is or even better what the various switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches 2 banks of 4 switches and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined by following traces that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3 SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4 and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number but it is blank. Immediately below the words SERIAL NO but not in the box left for the S/N are the numbers 1990 2 8. Anyone have any clues?

My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But : for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these. Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your IDE drive does not have a label then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle is center polarized that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side then you can identify pin 1 as follows: look into the pins with the notch at the top pin 1 is at the top right.  On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins 39 & 40 (the oposite end) then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1. : Secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the master drive : and which into the Slave?  any help appreciated.  thanks... It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine then you can usually get voice help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be able to help you). Good Luck Gordon Lang"

That makes real sense. Actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence. The floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr by the way) really does stink. Wally Bass"

Apparently the clock >hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The >Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then >then advances the date. > >Anybody with more info? There are two 'problems': (1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit for day increment so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the meantime and (2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date' call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to increment the date the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time) and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL) there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly though the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time because DOS is not reentrant and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.

You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor than an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA then using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-) As for graphics cards assuming that the Atari monitor can be modified/adapted to handle VGA signals you should probably be able to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't tried this but that would be my guess... Robert Anisko anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com ...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper to go that route than to do the conversion; besides with the Falcon and beyond VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go..."

The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master. In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics. There are four links LK1 LK2 LK4 and LK5 adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector. LK2: LED When fitted this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130 Ohms ot 220 Ohms. LK1: Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector indicating to the Master drive the presence of a Slave. LK4: Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way. LK5: IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per second. There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered: Master single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted. Master single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted. Master dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted. Slave dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted. Master dual drive with LED on interface		LK4 LK1 & LK2 fitted. Slave dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted. The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used. The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further details. ***************************   S E A G A T E   ************************* There is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM SCSI ESDIand IDE) on every Simtel mirror under /msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip It contains info about the following drives: st1144a	st138a	    st274a	st3283a st1057a     st1156a	st1400a     st280a	st351ax st1090a     st1162a	st1401a     st3051a	st9051a st1102a     st1186a	st1480a     st3096a	st9077a st1111a     st1201a	st157a	    st3120a	st9096a st1126a     st1239a	st2274a     st3144a	st9144a st1133a     st125a	st2383a     st325ax *********************	T E A C   ************** Model: SD-3105 Cyls.

"1","I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says the board is a 391 WB/H.  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card. Anyway that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays Parity Error -- System Halted messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to disabled or enabled in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?). I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures). I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order making sure that the connections were solid. My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card or to the motherboard (God forbid). CAN ANYONE HELP? Thanks Peace David Geller gelldav@elof.acc.iit.edu"

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a physical layer concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address it is most definetly changable.  But it is strictly software. Gordon Lang"

"1","Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade old 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a 16MHz 386 can be transformed into a 32MHz 486 with a single chip upgrade.

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5 that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS) my HD refuse to boot. Just my 2 cent. Jim"

"1","Hello I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ but couldn't find the answer. Anyway... The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is in my opinion still the best keyboard around.

Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. > > Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): > > The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape. ^^^^^^^^^^ It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200 I think) My question is: Does anybody use this product if yes how many bytes REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite unbelievable to me).

"1","I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). Well does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow!

"1","Hi everyone I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program. When I compile the program it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I can't seem to explain why it crashes. All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing. Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything?? I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup I will gladly re-post but this is the only I could find. Thanks in advance Sean Mars Email mars@carroll1.cc.edu Carroll College Waukesha WI"
"1","You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it's enabled and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory as well as the simms. The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your IDE controller also. Anyway perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better. mrb boltz@vivaldi.psu.edu mrb118@psuvm.psu.edu"

I've done some ASIC and digital design but not any CPU design. It would seem to me that on a 486 the FPU is not being used most of the cache is not being accessed the off chip buffers/drivers are idle the multiplier isn't multiplying the barrel shifters aren't shifting microcode isn't microcoding etc.  This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS) which means less heat.\ From what I understand the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power. -- Dennis Lou             || But Yossarian what if everyone thought that way? dlou@ucsd.edu          || Then I'd be crazy to think any other way!

If you ran dos you don't need a 16550 because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer.

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery. If however your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change though. It's also possible but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay get a virus scanner and check out your system."

It's also using IRQ 2) I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that explains how to sort this out but with no manual I don't know the Bboard number. If you can please help me with as many of the following as possible: a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668) c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can magicly get everything working. Any help at all would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance Red/."

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE 2 SCSI disk and 1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card but I also have a Future Domain a Western Digital SCSI card and I work with an ADAPTIC before.  As I recall all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. However to use with other controller (IDE MFM...) the boot drive has to be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE 1 SCSI). just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it. Then set up the SCSI controller (IRQ DMA etc). Set the SCSI drive to ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on.  If you have more question email me I will try to answer it. Good Luck! William"

Since installing DOS 6.0 when I tried to re-install software from 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks when I mount the second..third..fourth disks DOS 6 doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a DIR I see the contents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize that diskettes have changed is to do a label and then to not label them. Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable and worked well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro and DESQVIEW/X ( with QEMM Manifest etc) so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using.

But does anyone have a controller for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going? How about for an EISA machine?

The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems but you should still check your software! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels the connector type the pinouts and the signal protocols.  The connector is a DB-25 but IBM has set an alternative standard of DB-9.  The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD) Recieve Data (RD) and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the connection has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined but they are obsolete.  I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows: Name    DB-9     DB-25 SG       5        7 TD       3        2 RD       2        3 DTR       4       20 DSR       6        6 DCD       1        8 RTS       7        4 CTS       8        5 RI       9       22 Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE) there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert the CTS DSR DCD or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge or Lap- Link or Telix then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG TD and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio the question is do you need flow control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract escape codes but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair game.  Again you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more gotcha signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control if any can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection then I suggest you use this one.

"1","Hi: I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs! I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things: -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos) -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos) -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bits/pixel -	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of the images/data come from and is the most demanding of these tasks. I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup and decided that a nice system (price/performance) would be: 486DX-50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus 15 monitor 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise.  Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following configuration: 486DX-33 64k cache ISA 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+ 2 meg ram 14 monitor 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or been uncovered! There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish running the local window manager.  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it make a difference?  I'm hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice (above) for that reason. Also are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive controllers be they IDE or SCSI can transfer via DMA.  These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus your arguement makes no sense this isn't an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands. The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data. >>Its a long story but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which >>thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later when the device is done it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback.

(Assuming >a drive which needs formatting) Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it knows about. Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card sometimes you can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that you must use a third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor Disk Manager or the like. IDE drives come formatted already and since the is controller part of the drive mechanism itself concerns about geometry are irrelevant.

"1","In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80 you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100% if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a 20MHz 486SX then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and I will respond with a couple of sources.

I know Adaptec is good but they are kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also I have seen on the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the quantum? 2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable. Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive. 4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.

Ambiguous votes which cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is provided will be identified in the final vote tally. Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!! Rationale --------- The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library government and network usage and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not and ought not be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups. The reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics and between the two main focal points of software i.e. fulltext and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA CDI CD-R Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books copyright issues and other legal matters packaging distribution could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing in any format and is appropriate to the Internet. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as index and retrieval software premastering software cdrom simulation software hypertext sgml scanning and imaging software data capture software data clean up compression encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and video. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing as well as hardware for data capture such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom. Notes ----- These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan. Charter ------- Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.software will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: Index and retrieval software Authoring software Scanning and imaging software OCR and OCR cleanup Hypertext SGML Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.hardware will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: CD-R equipment Data capture hardware Scanners Video and audio capture hardware Networking hardware Midi hardware Photo CD hardware Publishing systems CDI and DVI hardware Compression and encryption hardware Keyboarding Other hardware publishing topics Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA The USENET newsgroup comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics but not limited to them: Multimedia authoring software Imaging software Audio and Midi software Color control software Video editing software Audio editing software Multimedia utilities useful for publishers Integration of text image audio and video Compression and encryption of multimedia Multimedia copyright and related legal issues Multimedia databases and hypertext Other multimedia publishing topics -- Henry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu Brooklyn NY            * Disclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that of anyone else :-)  ????!"

"1","Serial cables: There are only three output signals: TD DTR and RTS. There are five inputs signals: RD DSR DCD CTS and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang"

Also the DX2/66 is faster in the operations that run off internal cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're having a GREAT Day! they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to. The details: I ordered one of their house brand Infotel 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem I would not have ordered it had I known this in advance. It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4 providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time. For several reasons I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem nothing was connected to COM2. Although the modem appeared to work during every connection at 9600 or 14.4 it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support they suggested disabling the COM2 port. This appeared to solve the disconnect problem but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a Tech Support rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured. Conclusion: I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection. For $30 more I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better..."

I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you want a real answer post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster. personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact this is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now. and now to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions post them to comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm if someone posts complete and utter bs you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds too.  there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis of course is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation LAPM) but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >The difference >with the Courier is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question: >In a previous article cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says: >>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST modem or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST period.  it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST. also not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb. >This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about HST we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme. >The Sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way >only. I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e. part of the standard).  it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual). second HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if you're logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of info back transfer files (not using bimodem) etc....  there is of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again more correctly put *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do) you're S.O.L.....  there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25 the 33 and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance with the cache enabled is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache which is around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2 compatibility but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX PGA and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available from Cyrix there.  Anyway the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16 and 386DX-20 only.  Double these clock rates and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50 then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K external cache performance were about 30% faster than the 25 but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO the DLC is a great low price upgrade for people who can't afford or can't install a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it but if you need 486DX-33 performance the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure about the DLC-40 but I think even if it matches the performance it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC people sent quite a bit of mail asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip e-mail me and I can fax or mail you more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use So I can;t post anymore info here.  However if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God you say...

Date: Wed Apr 21 19:01:49 1993 The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an idle temp - not doing lots of bus i/o not doing floating point not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This is in a Micron computer without heatsink. I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip but I might take the fan off.  It makes a horrible whine at times and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc... -- Rob Scholten scholten@epg.nist.gov End of File Press RETURN to quit Rob Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks of use mine did... As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink instead. Work just like a charm but the realy biggy to think about is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while! Sam -- Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...

I have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system. When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like you have connected to another EC modem doesn't realy say that. But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on on your modem. I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$ in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test bench.

I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill. I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=>17) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been very happy with a 16 on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic. Ok stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?

"1","==== BEGIN REPOST ==== IBM Apple Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week as Motorola Corp. IBM and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks respectively sources said. Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80 respectively. The 601 a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. The chip which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture is bus independent so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures including ISA EISA or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design one source noted. According to sources familiar with the development effort Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100 one source said. ==== END REPOST ===="

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only} some monitors and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous} SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports electronics and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode hence term 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit} 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit} and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit}. 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2. 8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2."

"1","FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax v.42 v.42bis and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression so you can get error-free links up to 57600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will fall back to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows OS/2 Unix etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom US Robotics etc).  And it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996 or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store. > I was told that it should be possible but that they had no idea how > it might be done.  Nor did they particularly care to investigate. OK here's my results so far.... 1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support Analogue video input (It works but isn't very linear...) 2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter. If you don't know how to do it don't even contemplate it.. :-) 3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode. OK having said that I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder. I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge and doesn't care about the polarity outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires. There are 2 reasons for doing this 1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're in - herc emulation is +- while MVGA is ++ for example. 2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes 3!) monitors sitting on my desk and I want to get that number down as much as possible. Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour I can get down to 1. Ultimately the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else so it'll have to wait... -- Alan Brown dogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz"

The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge have never heard of Unix and have very little interest in learning.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board.

You can get SCSI and IDE to work together but there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542): * You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives. * You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this though) and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to the SCSI BIOS but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

You might find it interesting. -- Darryl Okahata Internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com DISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day. =============================================================================== > 1)  Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE?   Will there be a noticable >     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate? For MSDOS applications ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up in some cases).  You'll also pay much much more for a good SCSI controller. Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix). Unfortunately neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage. However note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices. If you're only going to be using MSDOS stick with IDE.  It's cheaper and you'll have less headaches. > 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my >     hard-drive (bernoulli box CD-rom Tape Drive etc). [ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ] No.  Generally you have to find drivers for each SCSI device which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the better/high performance SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card or can be purchased (for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are: * Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI controllers. * CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)). This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card that has an ASPI driver like the Adaptec. Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately it works only with Adaptec controllers. > 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a >     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar >     equipment. Yes you will run into problems if you're using a high-performance bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound right doesn't it?  It's true though.  With one of these controllers you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250) and Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape backups).  If you want a copy of my Adaptec 1542 hints and tips file send email. These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC (e.g. no standards).  However adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible. SCSI holds a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1 stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say probably because while I know this to be true with a PC Unix I don't know if this really will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will but I don't know for sure.  ]"

The price is about the same but the Gateway has significantly better performance (200MB vs. 120MB hard drive 50Mhz 486DX2 vs.  25Mhz 486SL) and much cheaper accessories (extra batteries modem...) The concern I have about Gateway is the durability and reliability. Does anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad? Thanks Denis Lambert denisl@col.hp.com"

Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster >Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure >you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS obviously. Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens but a slightly simplified explanation. Technically the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer adapter SoundBlaster modem hard disk ...) to signal the CPU that Something's happening here please take note. How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. In MS-DOS the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt. Now basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When DOS prints it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there wait a while and check again.  If there's not copy a new character to the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case the SB. With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely it wastes a lot of CPU cycles.) Hence you can't share the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot. Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. When the SB plays plain music the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is needed. You can however hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt but use them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports and it can see from which port the data came from. This of course applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well. Remember this was greatly simplified in parts but I think gives the general picture correctly enough.

"1","I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday and installed it into my Gateway DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2 but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2 or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this cascade to IRQ8-15 business? A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5 6 7 are 16 bit DMAs and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question after installing PAS16 my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far).

This card is fairly fast will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768 but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS (the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17 Magnavox which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match. But...

Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A) and what I would say is a standard (not special no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? I actually have a PAS-16 and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2? Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions. Randy"

"1","I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK but is unhookable to anything standard (CGAEGAVGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise. I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card."

I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month when it is released though it'll be in limited quantities I think they have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out a bit later). Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal frequency right?) you're gonna love the 2 megs version.

It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and 800x600x16 bit at 90Hz too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate) If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL you should go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW) in the video sig.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now. SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives (ESDIRLLIDEetc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers to get it to work with odd environments.

The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a (stuff deleted) My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip. It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case so the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go. All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable. There are other board type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment. The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison: Wintach Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 Its no Viper but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee oliver@earthview"

"1","I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3 but when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC it shows up as COM3 with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)! When I get into debug and dump the data at 40:0 it shows the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem should be at COM4. Now I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4 2E8 IRQ3. To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC I have to configure the modem as COM3 2E8 IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that allows that the FAX program that came with the modem does not work. Anyway I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set as COM4... I did run a few diagnostic programs and they did not help at all: a few displayed the modem as COM4 and others displayed it as being COM3. I am not using Windows this is just a DOS problem...Any help or pointers appreciated.... For various reasons I must have this modem work at COM4 thus switching COM ports is not an answer... (Last time I posted this I did not get any DOS specific answer this time I have included all the specific information....please help!) ----- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org -- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org avinash@genesis.nred.ma.us"
"1","I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5 drives in particular the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap and have nice 3-5 year warranties. My questions are: Is there a catch? Which one is better? What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use? Is the service generally better for one of these manufacturers? Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason? thanks Michael Taylor"

On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter and it worked fine (rather he sent in the coupon for the converter). In other cases I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever else.

All tests were made on the same >computer with the same disk no cache and the same (big) files were used. Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else.  With Stacker any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. Personally I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff.  Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive. >But DOS 6 is quite good; reformat disks? I honestly don't understand WHY >you had to do this. Ditto. koberg"
"1","greetings.. I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware. My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to configure it as slave drv but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western Dig since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted It just beeped and gave me an error message about HDD controller. So I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD. any help on this matter would be much appreciated. (before I trashed my 42MB) Thankx much Handy Trisakti - uc532838@mizzou1.missouri.edu"
"1","Which would YOU choose and why? Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A) and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? Thanks for any comments. Randy"
"1","Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5 floppies? These drives are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Just a thought. Kin Chan sparrow+@cmu.edu"

"1","Hi peeps Here's another of those any ideas type queries. I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy without a keyboard.  But no problem so far. When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams? Sync? So any ideas.

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better performance though.

To put it a little differently: - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer. - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7 usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - Unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers (i.e. either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers (assert high assert low or don't assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. (Incidentally note that there's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines and that certainly isn't a requirement.) - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2 NT (?) various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons. And the SB16 alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers. Joe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)"

However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark. A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy drive plug the same cables into the floptical stick in a flopti-disk and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy. On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers I have reread a PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was quoted as saying that a 2.5 MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being productized. The article said that one of the problems holding back development in this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead to get MDs accepted. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625 inmos ltd 1000 aztec west almondsbury bristol bs12 4sq They didn't like the rates they don't like the poll tax and they won't like the council tax.   - Nicholas Ridley"

While this is true there are fixes for those who have already bought Diamond cards.  In Linux for example there are utilities that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards but at least this will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X. I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card for specialized free software avoid Diamond.  But if you already have one there may be a fix that can help you.

As far as I know there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory thereby erasing it. This will remove the password but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386 there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is something like this on your board too. In the future I would suggest that YOU set the password and leave it on Setup only. That way no-one else can go and reset it or set it to  Always unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386's for just the same reason. -Dale /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ |      DALE M.

"1","HI that might look like a dull request but I have been following this newgroup for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind. I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow. I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide; - quality of windows drivers; - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff). Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip info but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it  let me know. If this information is of any use here is my system configuration: - Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) - monitor DARIUS 14 non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) (can reach 70kHz horizontally) I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings. Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me Guy Lamouche lamouche@ere.umontreal.ca"

With the directly attached fan units I've seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage not just stop working temporarily. > I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel > to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout though. > My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu and it's located so the front fan which sucks air into the case blows right on the heat sink.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340 you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I haven磘 used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet but it might speed up twice. dieter -- Dieter Fritzsche                                      dieter@dischw.toppoint.de Maehlsweg 32 D-2300 Kiel 17 Germany                         Master of the WOM Tel   .: +49 431 362705 (Voice) FAX\BOX: +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX		 compuserve  100060654"

From what I've seen in coursework most CPUs never actually idle.  They will continue to service interrupts etc. etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

"1","Organization: Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia I have a floppy drive which has developed General failure errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5 drive). I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now. However it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk) the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector. Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it. Thanks!

"1","Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

My guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to send me some literature and will report back to the net after I've studied it.

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

I have two SCSI hard drives each has 512KB of 'cache'. There several reasons for this :- When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted. When the drive receives data to be written the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out. In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache! May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well... > > -- > > TMC > (tmc@spartan.ac.BrockU.ca) > Guy -- -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Guy Dawson - Hoskyns Group Plc. guyd@hoskyns.co.uk  Tel Hoskyns UK     -  71 251 2128 guyd@austin.ibm.com Tel IBM Austin USA - 512 838 3377"

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Simple.  First Andrew is correct although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example.  For some time I was short of free interrupts.  I had a tape controller (not a floppy tape) that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2 where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced it would most likely hang.)  Likewise when the tape backup software runs it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) -- Kenneth R. Ballou				VOICE:		 (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software Inc.

"1","Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5 hard drive model LPS240A and have a concern about its behavior. Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I/O it performs what I call phantom seeks. When the PC is absolutely idle I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card not the drive.] My other hard disk a Seagate ST3283A does not have this kind behavior.

As far as I know very little fully matches a NEC in image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any difference between the two!) but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both. But many comapnies NEC included according to one article I read (I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!) which claim low emissions but not specifically MPR-II Compliant or MPR-II Certified only control for one usually VLF and ignore the other. So the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis- tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best) but not as low emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality but for all I know you may be more discerning.  Good luck! - Mitch v063kcbp@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu (Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)"

This is a common misconception shared my many manufacturers programmers and users alike.  COM3 for example is simply the third equipped COMM port not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1 etc.  If you're playing by the rules you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of standard (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports. So what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly I don't know of a simgle program that would actually have a problem with this.) -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com"

I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read). Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format. I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE.

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is What is the DoD? then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be How do I get a DoD number? That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling creative and your favorite number hasn't been taken already you can make a request subject to KotL approval. (Warning non-numeric non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won't get it but you _will_ pay for it.) Oh and just one little tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and you'll look like a clueless newbie too. By now you're probably asking So who's the KotL already?. Well as John Sloan notes below that's about the only real secret left around here but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-) though John was the original KotL. Second in keeping with the true spirit of Unix the KotL's first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5 the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers). Fourth there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head. ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ****************** Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?). *********************************************************************** One more thing the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. So provide some information for the list will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number name state/country & e-mail address. For example: 0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership that's not strictly true these days as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.) Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Denizens of Doom by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161) [Road Rider August 1991 reprinted with Bruce's permission] There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops helmets anti-fog shields spine protectors aerodynamics three-angle valve seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship.  They argue with each other and plan rides together. The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer. The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers; the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently rec.motorcycles (pronounced wreck-dot-motorcycles it's the file name for the group's primary on-line meeting place) carries about 2250 articles per month;  it is read by an estimated 29000 people.  Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the Denizens of Doom usually referred to as the DoD. The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name Denizen of Doom.  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002 retroactively and of course Nickerson the originator of the parodies was given DoD nr. 0001. The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the List issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada as well as Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom France Germany Norway and Finland. Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later.  Again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation.  So far the Denizens have contributed over $1500 to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As often as possible the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder Colorado and in California's Silicon Valley.  Consequently two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado and the Northern versus Southern California Joust. The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass followed by a big barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus Ohio in July. Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub rec.motorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie it's a great way for kindred spirits to get together.  Long may they flame. Live to Flame -- Flame to Live	[centerbar] This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as flames; issuing them is called flaming.  Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be something like:  What an incredibly stupid statement you Spandex-clad poseur!  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding ability and your cat. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_ by John Sloan  DoD #0011 Periodically the question What is DoD? is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as Why is the sky blue? If there is a God why is there so much suffering in the world? and Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you? the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations. A long long time ago (in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago) a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles and signed it The Denizen of Doom. Not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2 not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused) so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club and started signing his postings with his membership number. Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members. In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way) yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region) a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9) club patches (organized by #11) and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)! Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. The DoD has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets).

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent (the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against you. Read 'em and weep. We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! Muck: I don't mean to preach Terrible but lighten up on the BMW crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer 11 but what the heck. Stompin: No way the BMW is it complete that's all man. Terrible: Nahhhh you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey at least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor! Not as good as a Puff-a-cane should have been called a Woosh-a-stream. Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream. Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements??? Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see what they say eh? Muck: Now men let's try to be civil about this. High Tech: Hi I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest. Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW! Terrible: B.T.??? Arlow: Burley Thumpison the greatest all American ride you can own. Muck: Ahhh look you're making Terrible gag. Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? Muck Arlow High: Beats Me Wilhelm. Terrible: Actually my name is Terrible. Hmmm I don't know either. Muck: Say here comes Chunky Bear. Chunky: Hey Hey Hey! Smarter than your average bear! Terrible: Hey didn't you drop your BMW??? Chunky: All right eh a little BooBoo but I left him behind. I mean even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! Muck: It's okay we all makes mistakes. Out of the blue the West coasters arrive led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy Heritick Ratatnack Buck Garnish Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! Heritick: Heya Terrible how's yer front to back bias? Terrible: Not bad sold yer BMW? Heritick: Nahhh. Hooter: Hoot Hoot. Buck: Nice tree Hooter how'd ya get up there? Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!! Muck: What's a carbujector? Hooter: Well it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!! Muck: Ahh come on down we aren't going to flame ya honest!! Dill: Well where do we race? Snob: You know Chunky we know about about your drop and well don't ride! Muck: No! No! Quiet! Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion. They even have luggage made by Sourkraut! High: My 9 too! Terrible Heritick Dill Buck: Nahhhhh!!! Stompin Tread High Chunky Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!! Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! Polyanna: Well men the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting it up on the ole ventral stand! Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! Booster: I hate Cavortin. All: WE KNOW WE KNOW. Booster: I love Cavortin. All: WE KNOW WE KNOW. Muck: Well what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras? Snob Tread: Nawwwwww. Muck: What about a Tridump? Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum? Muck: Auggggg Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity? Heritick: Heyya Muck you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself? Muck: No no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make. Two more riders zoom in in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever. Phalanx: Hey I don't know about that. And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest! Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector! Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey BMW's are great men. Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers personally. More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame. Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison. With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. Clean: Like look Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. Muck: Why?? Clean: Well like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin. Muck: But I only have a 4-banger. Clean: No GOOD! Chunky: Sob some of us only have 2-bangers! Clean: Inferior! Stompin: Hey look here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe Beemer Babe give me a thrill... Road Terrible Polyanna Maulled Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? Heritick Stompin Snob Chunky Tread Kite High Arlow: BEAT'S ME WILHEM! Road Terrible Polyanna Maulled Dill etc.: Oh don't you mean BMW? And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. All: no No NO!!! Puhlease. Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of The Yearning and Riderless with its ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the question of: To Helmet or Not to Helmet will be aired this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94 [Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure whom we'll call Chuck stands by a printer output bin wearing a white CDC lab coat with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as Chuck. I guess you had to be there. I wasn't.) Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst cow-towing to the whims of a machine and saying yessir nosir may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted to live a man's life [Music slowly builds in background] riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys living the life of a Motorcyclist; doing donuts and evading the police; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children; eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short I Want to be      A Denizen! [Chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket (with fringe) boots and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background gunning their engines showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts and leaking oil on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.] Chuck [Sings to the tune of The Lumberjack Song]: I'm a Denizen and I'm okay I flame all night and I ride all day. [Hell's Angels Echo Chorus surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He's a Denizen and he's okay He flames all night and he rides all day. I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline Running children down with glee. [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline Running children down with glee. [Chorus refrain]: 'Cause He's a Denizen... I ride real fast My name is Chuck It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck But like a real good sh*t. Oh I'm a Denizen and I'm okay! I flame all night and I ride all day. [Chorus refrain]: Oh He's a Denizen... I wear high heels And bright pink shorts full leathers and a bra. I wish I rode a Harley just like my dear mama. [Chorus refrain] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Why you have to be killed. Well the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen it intends to remain one. Sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked: What does DoD stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it? Naturally a Denizen who had watched the movie Top Gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied: That's classified we could tell you but then we'd have to kill you. And the rest is history. A variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers where known) include: Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes Note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The rec.moto.photo archive First a bit of history this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive. Not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too they include the DoD membership list the DoD Yellow Pages the general rec.motorcycles FAQ and this FAQ posting. Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive. ********************************************************** Via ftp: cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21] Via e-mail: The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND given one per line.  The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example you can send: dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII. Oh wildcards (*) are allowed but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. -- Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College    Norwalk CA             cerritos!tanner ********************************************************** A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second since Bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Patches? What patches? You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: I want! or That's sick! or perhaps That's sick! I want! Well there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no DoD store that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made they'll cost $xx.xx with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one? Then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action. Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11) pins (DoD#99) stickers (DoD#99) motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216) t-shirts (DoD#99) polo shirts (DoD#122) Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL] belt buckles (DoD#99) and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand]. All profits have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992 over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of Denizens of Doom USENET The World complete with a DoD pin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions. ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT I received the following letter from Jim Rogers director of the Museum the other day. Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom: Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation the total amount donated is now $5500.  On behalf of the AMHF please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently being prepared.  Of course everyone is invited to come to the museum to see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again thank you for all your support which means so much to the foundation the museum and the fulfillment of its goals. Sincerely Jim Rogers D.O.D. #0395 Director P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board. As you all know even though the letter was addressed to me personally it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this amount possible. Arnie ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Rules Regulations & Bylaws of the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club From time to time there is some mention discussion or flame about the rules of the DoD. In order to fan the flames here is the complete text of the rules governing the DoD. Rule #1. There are no rules. Rule #0. Go ride. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Other rec.motorcycles information resources. There are several general rec.motorcycles resources that may or may not have anything to do with the DoD. Most are posted on a regular basis but they can also be obtained from the cerritos ftp/e-mail server (see the info on the photo archive above). A general rec.motorcycles FAQ is maintained by Dave Williams. Cerritos filenames are FAQn.TXT where n is currently 1-5. The DoD Yellow Pages a listing of motorcycle industry vendor phone numbers & addresses is maintained by bob pakser. Cerritos filename is YELLOW_PAGES_Vnn where n is the rev. number. The List of the DoD membership is maintained by The Keeper of the List. Cerritos filename is DOD.LIST. This WitDoD FAQ (surprise surprise!) is maintained by yours truly. Cerritos filename is DOD_FAQ.TXT. Additions corrections etc. for any of the above should be aimed at the keepers of the respective texts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (Loki Jorgenson loki@Physics.McGill.CA) has provided an archive site for motorcycle and accessory reviews here's an excerpt from his periodic announcement. ********************************************************** The Rec.Motorcycles.Reviews Archives (and World Famous Llama Emporium) contains a Veritable Plethora (tm) of bike (and accessories) reviews written by rec.moto readers based on their own experiences.

Rather than trying to catch every occurence I'm just sticking the latest info down here. Estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35K  [news.groups] Approximate DoD Membership: 975  [KotL] DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. Over $5500  [Arnie] Organized (?) Rides: Summer 1992 saw more organized rides with the Joust in its third year and the Ride & Feed going strong but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR) with bikers from as far north as NH and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG) another successful excuse for riding motorcycles and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.] Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes.  And though it's not an official (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan CT last fall where I had seen a nice used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago signing the liability waiver and getting his pre-flight off he went... Well not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good) heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty the shop manager slid up beside me and asked Friend of yours Steve?.  Shit Matty it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS! Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later when Jeff's color had paled to a flush Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike. I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested. -- Stephen Manes					   manes@magpie.linknet.com Manes and Associates				   New York NY USA  =o&>o"

"2","Re: Waving... I must say that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by itself there's something really special about having someone say to you Hey it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time on the road on days like this... with a gesture. Was sunny today for the first time in a week took my bike out for a spin down to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were down there for similar reasons (there's this GREAT stretch of road on the way down there... no side streets lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... Went on an impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who I didn't know but who were my kinda people nonetheless.

"2","OK I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally it had a CBR900RR style tank full fairing and only a tach.  Now at first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing) but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 900RR gauges.  Overall the bike looked like a 900RR except for the rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk) So what did I see? (PS for any of you Boulder DoDers I saw it parked at the Engineering center today. It is white with light green stripes.) ________________________________________________________________________ Nick Coburn                     DoD#6425                      AMA#679817 '88CBR1000              '89CBR600 coburnn@spot.colorado.edu ________________________________________________________________________"

Obcountersteer:  For some reason I've discovered that pulling on the wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong side if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For example rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn right (Hi Lonny!) pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe I need psychological help.

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage I had the opportunity to listen to some of the creative excuses offered the judge by others. After listening to a number of Well I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up versions I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than impressed with any of them. This young rather burley looking guy had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper. He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had alcohol on his breath but was not cited for this offence. The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice: Well son those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for your self? Well Sir meekly the defenant replied I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home. He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home. The judge moved by the simplicity of the response fined him the maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school.

Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the er step function provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.

Personally I think it's your Duty As a Citizen to make it as much trouble as possible for them so maybe they'll Give Up and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon. The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing your speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions an Oakland judge who convicted a speeder on the officer's testimony that the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed. You can pay off the State and your insurance company or you can take it to court and be creative.  Personally I've never won that way or seen anyone win but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven't seen _that_ many attempts. You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing they therefore appear to be further away and so their speed appears to be greater than it actually is.  I left out a step or two but you get the idea.  If you can make it convincing theoretically you're supposed to win. I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see some other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts like the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car and the distance at which the cop had been pacing him and end up demonstrating that he couldn't possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'd brought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keep in mind cops do this all the time and their word is better than yours. Maybe though they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time. Besides this guy didn't speak English very well and ended up absolutely confounding the judge the cop and everyone else in the room who'd been recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota. Ahem.  OK I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation been more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause."

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify: Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards anyway) because they have never held education above basic reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid just ignorant. (They might be stupid but then so are some high percentage of any group).

Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under- qualified) good-for-nothing dishonest white people who are mean as snakes.

It depreciates much faster too. ==================================================== John Stafford   Minnesota State University @ Winona All standard disclaimers apply. ---------- The '84 GL1200A hit the traps at 13.34 according to Cycle magazine. Yeah they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost 16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost. Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new not sure. If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere $2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know Harleys tend to depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-) According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

"2","This morning a truck that had been within my sight (and I within his) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and pulled over right on me -- my front wheel was about even with the back edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him. It was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him as he slewed over (with no signal of course) on top of me with my little horn blaring (damn I need Fiamms!) but the satisfaction of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough especially when I later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made no apologetic wave or anything. Is there some way that I can memorize the license plate of an offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner? I'm not going to firebomb houses or anything I'd just like to write a consciousness-raising letter or two. I think that it would be good for BDI cagers to know that We Know Where They Live.

That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.

"2","According to BBC Radio this morning UK Denmark Portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.  The reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a rare example of governmental wisdom.  The limit has a five year moratorium on it and specialist manufacturers will be exempt anyway.

"2","My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now. I'm considering two basic options: 1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs due to recent price increases but I'd imagine over $400. That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact that I can later add the pants and that it nearly eliminates the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit. 2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new Hein-Gericke FirstGear line however they may be a bit pricey unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather are potentially slightly better protection enhanced pose value (we all know how important that is :-) possibly cheaper than upper Aerostich. Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers (mainly a sizing thing) if leather i'd prefer a zip-out lining it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows shoulders forearms possibly back/kidney protection etc.) a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice ventilation would be a plus however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

"2","Hi I just have a small question about my bike. Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic I just don't know what to think about my Honda. She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike week this spring) and all of a sudden she trailed smoke like hell and was running only on one cylinder. I towed the bike home and took it apart but everything looks in perfect working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons the cylinder walls look very clean and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All still within factory specs. The only thing I could find however was a slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem) but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for this bike. Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the wear of my pistons?? Please send comments to sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca Thanks in advance.

This is a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had any problems with it. It's a four stroke 4 valves liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better suspension (Ohlins shock Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non competitive rider the engine is much better than any two stroke. You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear changes. The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better ride than most bike: plush suspension responsive steering with no head shake. So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee I want to buy a Husaberg which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$."

Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge about the circumstances surrounding your ticket while one fellow lost because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness. Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called Fight Your Ticket. The general theme from those who said go for it was to be prepared. I should do as much research as possible go back and review the scene transcribe what happened to tape or paper use any witnesses that may have been around have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge and to be positive and assertive.  I am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp> A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed as this might trip up the arresting officer he may not show up if the date is on his day off or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.

Plus extras like hot showers Tours a Concourse D'Elegance and more. This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner Rally Chairman The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our two most favrite highways- Highway 70 which goes through the Feather River Canyon or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's Highway 49. Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a pre-registered guest of a BMW rider. The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89 two miles South of downtown Quincy. For pre-registration forms and additional information write Doug Hubbard BMW Club of Northern California 41236 Norman Court Fremont CA 94539 or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195 ADDITIONAL NOTES:: This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth. Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one to make.  The only problem has been that there are so many activities that attendees have to choose one over another. Quincy is a beautiful campground lots of grass and little dust. For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa Quincy has lots of space all of it flat so room is not a problem. There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather. Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the awards ceremony. For members of the various clubs club awards will be based on registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 + needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>. and greatest distance one up & two up and all the usual things."

"2","Grf. Dropped my Shoei RF-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock it onto it's centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it... So I cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes. Then while it was drying I realized that I was out of smokes and that my cage is not currently running... So I had to take my bike down to the store. Not wanting to mess up my paint job I said Well heck. I can just use my old helmet.... this is your standard el cheapie openface... I didn't notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei but switching back was really bad... 1) Doesn't fit worth a damn too wide in the sides too short front to back... 2) With a faceplate it's still bloody windy... with the shoei I normally ignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish... with this one taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind. The question for the day is re: passenger helmets if you don't know for certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church meeting yeah that's the ticket)... What are some guidelines? Should I just pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (XL) or should I maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely passenger?"

What you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic Cleaner. They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from plastic. For fine scratches just use the Polish for bigger ones start with the Cleaner and finish with the Polish. The stuff is $5-8 bucks per bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores.

"2","Yo did anybody see this run of HARD COPY? I guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for speeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step out of the car the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia. Ang then the cop gives chase. Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!! Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights) slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop signs and making car jump to the side he goes up a dead end street. The Kat although not the latest machine is still a high performance machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse we all know that cages especially the ones with the disco lights can't stop as fast as our high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the Kat. Luckily for this dude he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But dude how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah we've all went out and played cat and mouse with our friends but with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can you get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap to convince me not to try any shit like that.

The CB1000C was a shaft-driven overbore version of the CB900 and was made for exactly one year (yep head and base gaskets are VERY expensive). Helluva bike.

"2","I just mailed this: I noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR. The cut is only about as deep as the tread block and looks like it only scratched the rubber at the base but the weird thing is it's way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet. My questions are: 1. How dangerous is this should I replace the tire right away? and 2. If I should since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the tire only has about 330 mi on it what do you think my chances of getting it replaced under warranty are? To the nedod mailing list and Jack Tavares suggested I check out how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced.  Does anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy?

"2","I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got an opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced. If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens.  Read Fight Your Ticket too but don't miss the little section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're basically screwed. As you may have guessed I'm pretty down on the system here in California.  I've carefully prepared for court bringing witnesses and revealing serious holes in the officer's story only to be slapped with the maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying his own cases. So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take traffic school if you can.  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyer can present the exact same case as you the difference is the sentence. -- Paul Thompson    Apple Computer"

I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc. I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750 go for the extra cubes. I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I couldn't afford a Duc. Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers I'll probably be getting a 900SS next year... - Mark ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mark S.

I guess >there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out >but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the >canister.  Meaning: would gases so far down the line (the canister) >really have an effect on the exhaust stroke?  Do the gases really >compress that much? For discussion purposes I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture. 1.  Unless an engine is supercharged the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure is decreased allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good vacuum. 2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion. 3.  In the last 6-8 years the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time on high-performance bikes substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker. 4.  On older bikes  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted very little difference was noted unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well. 5.  In general an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | You can't wear out       | | davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout        | | '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.| | '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks | | '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks     | |       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     | | My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.        | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"2","Personally I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.  You may seem fine but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind.  I greatly enjoy social drinking but for me it just doesn't mix with riding. Max enjoyment! Eric"
"2","-- Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. As recommended I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was a little low but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold so that would explain the low numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash and no rust.  This bike looks great! It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires. I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes. ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about the transmission and taking my chances. Being a reletively new reader I am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup.  I would ask how to get my own DoD number but I'll probably be too busy riding ;-). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |     |\/\/\/|      ___________________                              | |     |      |     /                   \                             | |     |      |    /  Jamie W.

"2","Now I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not know what y'all been talking about but I have a few comments: In rec.motorcycles davet@interceptor.cds.tek.com (Dave Tharp CDS) writes: >1.

At no time >does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good >vacuum. There are a number of other factors that are very important the three biggest being air velocity air momentum and shock waves. Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm the stacks can greatly increase the speed and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves. <================================================> /        Rich Sturges           (h) 703-536-4443   \ /    NSWC - Carderock Division   (w) 301-227-1670    \ /  I speak for no one else and listen to the same.  \ <========================================================>"

I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint. As for price $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them. A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for BTW is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA. I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2 in diameter and about 5 long. The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it. I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into. The short horn is even with the fairing and the long one sticks out about an inch or so but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you). If you have any other questions about the mounting email and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red then you may want to paint them first. How do they work you ask? They are very very very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although the duration of the horn blasts have been short). I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them even though they know that I have the horns they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV. -TJK '85 FJ1100 with GET OUT OF MY WAY horns. That looks like a suit you'd fight a fire in -comment about the Aerostich"
"2","I am looking for advice on buying a susuki GS1100E.  does anyone out there know about any inherent flaws the bike may have or problems i should look for? what about insurance rates (is this bike blacklisted)? also as a person who has never ridden a motorcycle yet is buying a 1100 to start off with.... am I crazy?  I have been told by some people to start out small.... and by others that i am lage enough to handle an 1100 right off from the start (6'4 210 pounds) because some others might be a tad bit small. Oh yeah one more question.  Anybody in the chicago area know of any good instruction schools or programs where i could get aquanted before i just go buy one and kill myself getting it home. thanks brian p.s. please email me direcly because i do not get much of a chance to read your group...   thanks again.. :)"

As you point out the experiments would be difficult. But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn. 1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over. 2. Contact patch having shifted to one side causing bike to fall over. 3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side causing a torque which twists the bike over. Take an average bike/rider average bike wheel and at speeds of 5 15 and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant and at high speeds 3 is dominant and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all relatively speaking. By the way a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running group where we could start counter-footing arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners? -- Chris Malcolm    cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh          +44 (0)31 650 3085 Department of Artificial Intelligence    Edinburgh University 5 Forrest Hill Edinburgh EH1 2QL UK                DoD #205"

Never avoid a dog for the dog's sake only you're own. I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic to this approach.

"2","I'm a biker and a dog-lover. First and foremost I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first. Second it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent. Third it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word a kind word or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit! Now how does that all relate to biking?  Well first it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of. With a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road not on his driveway.  If necessary have a large stick rolled up newspaper etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog the greater your anger. Dogs will pick up anger just as they can pick up fear.  And since you and he are not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory and that you are prepared to fight to the death. Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment. The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language the less you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast I've learned a few tricks I think..."

My driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to. Granted I live in the country however I've seen neighbors whip out of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they claim they can tell that There's noone on the road for quite a ways.

The crappiest drivers make out like bandits because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy drivers.  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers' actions and that's not fair. Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of shit because the rest of us end up paying more. Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are inherently less safe than slower drivers and the NHTSA disproved that two years ago now.

Do I have to be the one to say it? DON'T BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM! That kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against. If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed on during the drop the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was intended to do.  Conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace the helmet.  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately you should. HELMETS GO ON THE GROUND ON A TABLE ON A CHAIR ON A SHELF OR ON ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY WILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN. Jeezus.

I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving or something but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore they would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation which is an additional factor in attributing blame.

"2","Yo Whaz up!!! Earlier I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well I saw one think that someone said about Show me a team that used Split- fires....  Well here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages. Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well for these guys splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers. Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders splitfires would increase overall torque but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's splitfires would not significantly increase power. But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell Daytona 1992).  However twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should theoretically help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made just stick 'em in. Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now) but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's. As far as racing teams....  Ducati team Fast by Ferraci used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em) but I don't know why they stopped since then. Also somebody check to see if they had them in 88..... Peace. Warren wcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu Have Suzuki will travel... At a local fix-er-up-er shop the bike repairest looked at a dumped ZX-7.

HG makes the v-pilot jackets mine is a very similar style made by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they ever made. Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere made of fashion leather made to fit men etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose area but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality but fit is iffy.

Well you can accomplish both goals actually if you have a definite physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  If your tastes tend to smaller more petite (cough) churchgoers it is more likely that they will have a smaller head and you can safely get a medium or small helmet.

Of course if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you give helpful motorcycle rides to then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any eventuality as far as legality is concerned and a spare handtowel in the tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport (rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.

That torque and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor. To a cruiser-motorcyclist chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice. Unless motivated solely by price these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice. To ignore these as well as other criteria would be insensitive. In other words no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements) You're fishing for flames Dave.

"2","> Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco > to Seattle?  And how much might it cost? I shipped my K75S from Portland Oregon to Daytona for this years bike week (I rode it back!).  The company I used is The Federal Co's. You can reach them at 1-800-747-4100 ex 214.  You either have to be a AMA member or maybe it is just a discount for AMA not sure. (Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN to become an AMA member) The shipping cost is based on the number of miles.  It cost me about $500 for Portland to Orlando.  $80 of that was insurance.  All I had to do is ride it to the shipping dock and siphon the gas out.  I think they can also pick up the bike from any business.  The bike arrived on-time at Orlando.  All I had to do was adjust the mirrors and add gas.  The bike was in perfect shape! --Gary"

I'll second that.  In addition I find my hazards to be more often used than my horn.  At speeds below 40mph on the interstates quite common in mountains with trucks some states require flashers.

"2","So it looks like I'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months starting several months from now and I'm already contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as possible. I have everything under control I think besides the batteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage they'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard anyone discussing this idea so maybe there's some reason why it isn't so great. But maybe someone can tell me. Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries drain the electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery) seal the container close up the batteries and leave them that way? Then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage I could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged. What's wrong with this? On a related but different note for you Bay Area Denizens wasn't there someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was it? Is there still any of it left?

Bill you are kidding yourself here. Firstly motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise?? >Mike I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural >affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total >waste of time for you (assuming your total training hasn't come from >simply from reading rec.motorcycles).  However 90%+ of the motorcyclists >I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience >as overwhelmingly positive.

Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing and realized he was right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge and I've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it who were at first as sceptical as I was. But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is absurd. Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn. And that was my original point. Mike"

It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand miles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes and all three used a bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits and by the time I had 10000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero. I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner it stops using any oil.

You can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying the threads.  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole.

Jeez Ed when you started talking about traction management policies I thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway locomotives... The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In practice I suspect most people do what you describe. >Saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless >advice to a newbie.  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out >where that is!  It also gives him zero information from which to >develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and >corresponding weight shift develop. If you don't slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether you've achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond them. In any case for maximum braking if (as I suggested) you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then you'll be doing exactly as *you* suggest!!"

In some states completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning so you won't learn any bad habits. Good luck.

"2","(note: this is not about the L.A. or NY Times) A few times a year a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs perfectly.  Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally but on these days it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say it puts me in a great mood. The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway about a mile or two south of the 10 my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me. Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time. ____________________________________________________________________________ Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Only when you actually see depressions > or actual cracks (using a magnifying glass) should you consider replacement. > -- This is not good advice.  A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a clunk leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact but no other visible damage.  I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give then delaminate then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs either inside or outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.) The bottom line though is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point to consider when purchasing a lid. -- Ken Franklin 	They say there's a heaven for people who wait AMA     	And some say it's better but I say it ain't GWRRA           I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints DoD #0126       The sinners are lots more fun Y'know only the good die young"

"2","Several years ago while driving a cage a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow down. However a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier. Apparently it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth if a dog decides to cross the street keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms but good enuff) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd def feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels. If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury. Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate. Graeme Harrison (gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com) DoD#649"

You will obviously need a bit of free play in your brake pedal to do this. It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of him/her/it may mean that something is wrong. The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth or the occupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such physically (on you or your now-parked bike).

"2","Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information: 1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with so that would have to cover everything (bike helmet anything else that I'm too ignorant to know I need to buy) 2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes a difference) 3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it? 4)  In DC as I imagine it is in every other state (OK OK we're not a state - we're not bitter ;)) you take the written test first and then get a learners permit.  However I'm wondering how one goes about learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could teach me and the most advice I've heard is either do you live near a field or do you have a friend with a pickup truck the answers to both of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs. It's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that doesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?

The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. A worse scenario: The same rider same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it. The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations AND what to do if in one. Thus the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course. -- staal@idt.unit.no"

"2","Sigha. 1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a slip-in bulb replacement)? 2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my not damn near bright enough incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and picked up this cheapo Motorcycle battery and charging system tester... Hook it up to the battery it's got 3 lights on Very good charge... Start the engine (to test the charging system) and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK but it stays down at the same point as just the battery. My question here is if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be darned near dead from supporting my lights etc... Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes? Is there an easy fix for this? 3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend finally got myass an endorsement.... which is REALLY GOOD because my cage just quit running worth a damn and I won't have money to repair it until the first... ;) And the weatherman says Bright and Sunny all week 20% chance of rain on friday... <big grin bugs in teeth>"

I don't >have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information: > >[...]  Any stories on how you all learned? I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do. Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride. I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test. On May 4 1984 I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb) I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late skidded the rear tire out and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed. Now this is anecdotal evidence to be sure but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did. So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it. >1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with so that would have >to cover everything (bike helmet anything else that I'm too >ignorant to know I need to buy) While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston) could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear plus the cost bike plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual) plus insurance plus registration and licensing fees plus the course you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance. >2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in >about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up >till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a >motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes >a difference) I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area ergo more expensive. >3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it? There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted. Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area at least when I was shopping were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper) although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales. -- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu) -- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA NRA ACLU et al."

I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she doesn't get out much anymore so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It is made of 3/4 articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable. It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders but unfortunately professionals can open it rather easily: 1) Freeze a link. 2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well). 3) Snip through the steel cables (which I have on authority are frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters. For the same money you can get a Kryptonite cable lock which is anywhere from 1/2 to 7/8 thick steel cable (looks like steel rope) shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish and has a barrel-type locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8 model). All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel. Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute. FYI I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.

There are probably a few fights on their books as we now speak.  That is another good reason to donate to their legislative fund. ____________________________________________________________________________ Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

I think a good lock and some common sense about where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway since the weekend there are only two bikes :( and no he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock it was too much hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8 weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin. Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US but very common in the UK.

Some will and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers. I was one I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works as I could do it in swerves but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique. >countersteering.

(I admit I've never actually seen this.) I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself.

My >recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV. When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object there are only four things to dissipate the energy: the immoveable object the helmet shell the helmet liner the rider's head the rider's ego (ok five). Assuming that the helmet/ head assembly takes the same impact if the shell cracks in one case then in the other the liner must be dented or the head gets jiggled. If it's the the liner that's dented the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it's the head that's getting jiggled maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all?

Figure. >John Stafford Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of slip device in the shaft to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately it didn't save the gears! On the topic of wheelies the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane do a stoppy(?) or rear wheelie. Man he had the rear end on this bike up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these activities anymore (now that I'm an old guy with kids of my own) but it looked damn impressive!!

A trained guard dog is not to be trifled with.  An untrained mutt may be another story. ObMoto:  A local dog used to chase me all the time.  Really annoying.  I finally started stopping every time he'd chase me.  He didn't know what to do then and would usually just slink off the road.  After a couple weeks of this he stopped chasing me altogether.

Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not. If you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable. I doubt I have to mention it but this trick isn't quite so smart on a GoldWing CBR600 any GSXR or any bike with fairing-mounted mirrors. I was a little surprised though to find that you had your helmet on your seat while you were centerstanding your bike.

Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front DS>fender a style later copied by Indian and the round side covers? No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin very similar to Max Friz's famous design but with an overhead point cam (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores so that the ground clearance was substantially increased: ==@==   <-Springer motor (front) Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/ This is roughly the idea except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke. The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves. Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal the engine's valve timing would be more or less random resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage however uses an electric oil pump. Wimps). Despite this fix the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine. With just a single overhead lobe and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point: /\ /()\   <-lobe / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity) |  |   | | |  |===| | =0=  <---piston | Note that the tip was not truly vertical (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the ground and this drawing doesn't show the curvature because there was none in the head itself. The bore curve would start about where the cylinder bore disappears in this diagram The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus the name. The Vik was a moderately successful racer lightning fast when it worked but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However no modern record of a production Viking has survived and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

A word of warning though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name. When I obtained my second motorcycle I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle. For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock. First the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it. Secondly the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I don't know if mine was a particularly poor example but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage and sometimes it would seem to engage only to fall open when I went to unlock it. Thirdly the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark.  I didn't try it (obviously) but I have my doubts that the lock mechanism would stand up to an insert screwdriver and TORQUE attack. Fourthly the cable was not in my opinion of sufficient thickness to deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle that is).  All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go through the cable in well under a minute. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Robinson                          UUCP:   ucbvax!cogsci!robinson INTERNET: robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu"

(Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident (right bloody in front of me) and was unable to save the life of one of the participants as I reported here.)  Also drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death which raises the insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly. In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence. It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue but a genuine safety issue.

"2","Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts! BACKGROUND ---------- The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers engineering motosports enthusiasts. The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little over one hundred and eighty-five members with contributors from New Zealand Australia Germany France England Canada Finland Switzerland and the United States. The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join. Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be flame-free. HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION --------------------------------- You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to: race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day (depending on the topic). NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the list directly. After you have contacted the list administrator you will receive an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site. Upon receipt of your RSVP you will be added to either the daily or digest distribution (as per your initial request). HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION ---------------------------------- It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the frequency of postings this appears to be about every other day. Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every 30-40K or so) please send a subscription request to: digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM HOW TO POST TO THE LIST ----------------------- This is an open forum. To post an article to the list send to: race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out) you can include a metoo line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX based mail systems). BOUNCES ------- Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully and if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I administer this list) contact me through my administration hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse before. Basically there are two ways to steer a horse plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus when neck-reining to the left the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants. One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs.

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime. That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes anyone who witnesses a crime can do so. Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation give them a description of the car and the license number and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute (ie search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested you will have to appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight as a cop's. --- Ed Green former Ninjaite |I was drinking last night with a biker Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM   |and I showed him a picture of you.

Sure you're hand's already on the throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either engaging the clutch or accelerating.  The first is a more complex manuver than a simple horn button push and the second ain't too bright when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than is the sound of an engine which is what they expect to hear (you are on the road!).

S&S Super E Carb: installation easy once I hacked down an Allen wrench to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes like a dream just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was so lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes and even backfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific no hesitation in any gear and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no need to rejet from the factory settings!

Ryan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not. This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer. Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner compacts over time long before the outer shell is damaged or delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail. Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors sissy bars and other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the comfort liner is unaffected dents and holes in the foam can seriously degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of parking your lid on the mirrors I suggest you look under the comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly damaged (or missing :-) replace the helmet. -- Jerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI HOGSSC BCSO AMA DoD #18 Chemistry Dept. Harvard Univ.

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car and far more dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity.  Basically stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also buying good protective clothing is helpful that way if something does go wrong you are likely to be less severely injured. First thing if possible take a (MSF) driver training course this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices. Second buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy piece of footgear is also very helpful though leather hiking boots a pair of old army boots or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay tied.  After those a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items. Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down take corners gingerly brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick tired taking any medication with drowsiness warnings or otherwise not in average shape. With care you should be ok. >The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for >a first time rider.

If you are shorter/lighter than average you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike. Possible models: The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500 GS650 etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650 it server me well. The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450 CB650 etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable. Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes but I don't know them as well. For mid to late '80s models of the above you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000 leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs. Hope this helps -David (dagibbs@qnx.com)"

"2","Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up became warm and sunny and the wind died.  About three weeks ago I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold and delivered the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes and not likely to move soon. Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes 50 used street bikes 35 cars and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm it seemed like a big moto party. After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C cheif of sales slime and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls I put the tank bag from the Hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the ST out to the lot I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought. Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST both feet down all I could think was big.  Then I put one foot up.  Heavy came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road. By 3000 rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where I95 splits away 128 is a lighly travelled two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there it meets 133 a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect if slow sport touring sections. Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear 4th gear purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth smooth smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz. The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill reversing camber twice-reversing radius decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder. The section of 133 we were on was tight but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in Spencer for Hire -- a place where you could really find Spencer his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to 128. About half way through the onramp I yanked Cindy's wrist our singal for hold on tight.  Head check left  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well now it had 25 miles on it so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring. Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the get off in a mile sign I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute. My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth comfortable hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than list just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is. -- Frank Evan Perdicaro 				Xyvision Color Systems Legalize guns drugs and cash...today.		101 Edgewater Drive inhouse: frank@marvin x5572				Wakefield MA outhouse: frank@contex.com 617-245-4100x5572		018801285"

A piece of advice for you:  don't be abrupt with the throttle.  No wheelies accelerate a wee bit more slowly than usual.  Consciously worry about spitting her off the back.  It's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers and I guarantee she'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her when you whack it open.  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time out too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.  She needs to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn and you need to learn her idea of shit!  Don't crash now! so you don't work at cross purposes while leaned over.  You can work up to more aggressive riding over time. A very important thing:  tell her to put her hand against the tank when you brake--this could save you some severely crushed cookies.

I find the weight shift can be very sudden and unnerving. It's one thing if they're just getting comfortable or decide to look over your other shoulder but I don't recommend having him/her shift her weight with each turn... too violent. Also (I think someone already said this) make sure your passenger wears good gear. I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or lacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I won't let passengers do it. What I do to myself I can handle but I wouldn't want to hurt anyone else so I don't let them on without gloves jacket (at least) jeans heavy boots and a helmet that *fits* >I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that >she'll want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated... Go *real* easy. It's amazing how solid a grip you have on the handle bars that your passenger does not. Don't make her feel like she's going to slide off the back and snappy turns for you are sickening lurches for her. In general it feels much less controlled and smooth as a passenger.

I tried gazing at CB750s and 900 customs but each time I sadistically pictured them being hurled off of large precipice (I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and taking holiday snaps but I can't figure that part out). What am I to do?  Everytime I read a .sig containing some spoked wheel wonder I shudder and feel pity that the poor soul has suffered enough.

I agree that DUI/DWI is serious.  We should have reasonable laws strict enforcement and tough sentences.  But Andrew did not post looking for sympathy over the consequences.  He posted asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote.  His post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS. He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in any way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving).  There are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC. Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem an outcast?  He has paid his debt to society.  Step off the high horse.  We have all been irresponsible in the past. With that said I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards rapists.  I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not severe enough.  The same may be true of DWI/DUI. If that is the case then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change.  If we had a reasonable law about DWI/DUI with a stiff penalty then fewer people would do it. At any rate Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law. If you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates tell your 'representatives'.

"2","After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have a couple of questions I hope you can answer: When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill cap does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully wiped clean and reinserted fully then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do I remove the cap wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without screwing it down before reading? The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute? My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy brighter replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one? As always I very much appreciate your help.

It feels good for the passenger to stretch her arms and a shoulder massage feels good too but the shoulders are connected to the arms and the arms to the handlebars...

"2","since at least one other person was interested in this: my FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired. yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand.  sprayed on paint.  thought about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month. soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder coating while extremely durable will not handle over ~600 degree temperatures.  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't be available for months at least.  they directed me to another shop that specializes in header coating. the other shop said they have 2 coatings available.  one is aluminized that can do 1200+ degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability. the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is thinner and not as durable.  both coatings have a textured finish (not super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush. price for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100.  i'm planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (UPS) next week maybe wednesday. sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks. axel"

"2","Hola amigos Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and smooth street bike low and lightweight with wide power and great brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S kind of rough for the city but great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable but I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately insurance is going to pluck me by the short hairs. Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They do this all the time for cars assuming that you're only capable of driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left... accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't. By the way I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes there and registering them.  To ease me of the shock can somebody guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two per annum. Muchas gracias Enrique"

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans). Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds even on my under-muffled Magna we can hear each other.  It's only above say 45 MPH that you can't really communicate. Balance: New passengers are a real pain because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out. Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers: - attire: helmet long pants boots/heavy shoes jacket. - Keep feet on pegs at all times unless I say otherwise.  Do not get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount in traffic just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!) - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said) - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!) - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and we're going straight.  Trust your butt not your eyes -- if you're confused close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel of it.  Or just hug me tight. - Please no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired but be gradual so I can compensate. - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired. - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing and know how to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to stress.  For example one of my first-time passwngers seemed to watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84 and whever we topped 35 mph she'd holler SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED I humored her for a while then simply covered the speedometer with the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster. Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the instruments and had a much better time.  Based on her experience driving a Lincoln Continental she was unwilling to trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.) Usually I'll point out the controls engine transmission brakes tires etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves and gives the bike a chance to warm up. Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little round nearly invisible stones. It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner on the first trip! Good luck -- have fun! -- DON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!"

I would also like to know if anyone has any sound advice as regards to INSURANCE - 27yr oldlicence for 9 yearsno accidents/claims/convictions.Am I old enough to get BMW owners club insurance yet or will I have to wait until next year?

We'll be riding some twisty > fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans). > An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja. Owww. Well I hate to be a wet sock but well... I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started riding myelf and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger seats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't even usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had a BMW. :) I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains or some such.  Then see how much pain she's in and proceed from there. The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger: - Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK and work out some sort signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready and at the stop he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off. - Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider asks you to :) - The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn. - Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably consistent shifting style).  Avoid helmet bonk.  Helmet bonk is when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It gets old real fast. - When pulling to a stop put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there. - Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider. - Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand. -- ********************************************************* Laura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com writer of trifles in shadows and blood *********************************************************"

We had 1 bad crash (nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest of hill on pavement/pea-gravel road) and her actions helped lessen the severity of it.  As we were crashing she stayed upright in the saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist.  I was able to get the bike slowed down 10-15mph before we were high-sided. She got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc remove a lot of rocks from my knee.  Had she panicked we would have probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury.

HOWEVER all this macho shit aside the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly. By all means if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP and sit there 99% of dogs will say Oh shit! This guy's serious! and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog and it probably will not bother you again. Llamas however are a different story.

Well every 7.5K or so I've checked the pad clearences and they never change!  If anything the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten up but I didn't think these kind could. Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for 30K on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything the clearances are tighter... What's the deal?

The battery held a charge and energetically started the car many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting.

Hence any apparent >similarity in handling characteristics may or may *not* be analagous >in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling >characteristics. OK as one last attempt I'll take a different tack. We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is is one of the effect dominant and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar. Let's look at the one that so far has sparked no controversy on its own gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning then change surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact patches and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It probably would since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because without the contact patches we can't turn.  Maybe there's a better way. Besides even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it. Looking at the contact-patch effect only however is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski or something like that but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these) but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's a similar suspension arrangement and no gyroscopes but we do have countersteering. Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there but from my observations of how handlebar angle force etc. relate to steering in general I'm willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. If you don't like this conclusion then don't accept it but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise go ahead.

Well I used to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerks or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic. Now I just try to get them off my tail. In heavy traffic I slow down a bit mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but I also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch into one of them and pass me - which is fine because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors. In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass I might pull over as if to look for a street number or name (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail. If this all sounds well wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic or perhaps (for any psych types) passive-aggressive consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding rather than from yelling at jerks. A ride can improve my whole day while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. On the other hand you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail) or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving. Get the organization to act on it is easy to say but says little about what one really can and should do.  What the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers.

(BTW as of a couple years ago the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes but the prices on the parts for these are not as high comparatively. For the 'rockets' anytime a bike goes down the plastic is usually cracked and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy then for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike slap it on a bike in for repair repaint it and make a tidy profit. The other parts more traceable can be used or discarded if they are too traceable.

Over the past year I have had only a few near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels.  Yesterday I got to add another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless.  I am sitting at a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car a wise decsion.  Suddenly I hear screeching tires.  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the moroon flying up right behind me in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the bike.  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel. I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident?  Suggestions?"

All you need to do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit. This isn't quite as silly as it sounds.  If you take a nice day trip over back roads (*not* highways full of people trying seriously to get from here to there) then you might be able to hold 35 mph comfortably.

If your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance (and not as the crow flies) this is 900km a day for 5 days.  If you spend the entire time on interstates which would be a total waste of time that's at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating/peeing/ sight-seeing etc. I was contemplating a similar trip but from Ottawa to LA or maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx. I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it I'd have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of time enjoying the country around me; i.e. stopping with a camera meeting towns-people going to a few bars.  No sense spending 2 weeks looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas pump.

When you're on the road in high winds stay alert.  Even more alert than your alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill you kind of alert.  Be aware of the terrain and how it may funnel wind in sudden gusts (well not gusts to somebody standing there but it's gusty 'cause you ride through it).  If you are riding in a steady crosswind be aware of a hill that will block the wind and adjust your lean angle.  Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side your lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave their turbulance cone.  Reducing your profile may help ie lean on the gas tank and kiss the triple clamp.  Keep a nimble hand on the steering be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts. Keep a larger than usual buffer zone both ahead and behind and to the side you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by countersteering.

When it runs it runs well. > Good point did not catch this in the original post. The only other things which come to mind since this is a gravity feed fuel system is this. The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas and as the engine and surrounding area warm up the hole seals up. One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the correct size preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow on the output side of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make sure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge to check for air leaks. With vacuum applied fuel should flow freely. To see if there is a vent problem do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are the control hose from #1 carb the petcock valve and possibly the fuel tank vent. Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold then there is something in the carbs screwed up but there are so many things to check I would be typing all day to list them all! Here are a few with everything back together apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs there are quite a few on each carb. I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American Honda does not resolve this get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number but I don't recall it off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked the support I received here would be your chance to tell them what you think! Buy the service manual on the F2 it is an invaluable source of information for working on your bike and I might add trouble shooting!"

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for engaged/disengaged?) until there are two cars stopped behind you. When the next BDI cager comes screaching in simply ride up along side of the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly just rapidly.

Have you actually every used your secret method to break all the different kinds of bike locks?  Or are you taking someone's word for it? The fact is it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to go into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in rec.motorcycles.  So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't even protect against an assault or discuss methods if you don't come out with it. See I have heard the ones about the pipes and the liquid nitrogen and the cordless Dremel tools and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method (I am not a bike thief so I really don't know for certain) is just to put a rod through each wheel and use four guys to just lift the bike into a truck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything. Since that method is so childishly easy I figure a nice visible chain or cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on to the next bike. (Hey finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-) |Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off |by such a trival tactic. WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft |the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your |property!  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock |of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned. What tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about we can't very well guard against it can we? For my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm with pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area C&C insurance and I try to park in obvious visible areas with lots of people about.  (See if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it at least some eyes are on it and if they get too rambunctious they'll set off the alarm.) That's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike the trick is to always keep its actual value well below blue-book so that it looks so crappy nobody would WANT to steal it and even if they were stupid enough to you would make a profit on the deal.  :-) Seriously if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting they both get a shitty-looking but useable cover locked on and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable locks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The only thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover and that was over winter storage with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm). Oh put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off. That's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put on bikes look well not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS since I have personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.

Suggestions? Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for about two years but here are my rules for traffic light survival: - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have to stop in such a location I pull almost completely next to the car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front) I turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane to increase my visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your taillight visible to traffic though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.) - On a flat road I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches. - If you are the last in a line of vehicles watch your mirrors *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching and can't see any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down get out of the way *now!* - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line I will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors of course :-). I vary the speed of the flicker hoping to make the cager notice that there's something in the lane ahead of him. Now with all that said it's the situation where you are first in line that I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line your forward escape route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that you don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line (although around here the #@$*! light activators are always right up next to the stop line!) and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation. Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind you? -rob. -- Rob Griffiths  | Erasure.ShonaLaing.WildSwans.B52s.U2.JudyBats.REM.Smiths robg@apple.com |  FAA Certified cloud basher  I wanna drive the Zamboni!"

I've often contemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the throttle but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would unballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I've employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog attacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at once while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock but no blood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (after complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs; no more dogs no more attacks. The telephone worked much better than the tire pump. Eric Bong DoD #0270 1986 FZ750 1987 FZR750 1991 VFR750"

"2","My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle in other words I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down for few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me when riding but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find there. Well upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that in addition to removing the cover I would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket. Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the exact term in english sorry) ?

While shopping for a passenger helmet I noticed that in many cases the external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL.  The difference was the amount of inside padding. My solution was to buy a large helmet and construct a removable liner from a sheet of .5 closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with the liner in and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out.

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down. Seriously concentrate on being very smooth and you will make her experience much more enjoyable.  Even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this.  It's more work but your passenger will appreciate it!  Also I've found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.  If you're going sport riding have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your arms.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say. The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish. I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames. The first does trade ``quality'' in the sense you mention for heat. This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly which I contend was done above is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity friends dinner or entertainment it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far at which point it becomes trite and boring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....) The other type of flame which you seem to be glorifying above has a few weaknesses as well.  In the first place it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other.  In the second discussing someone's personal qualities habits and so forth can quickly become libelous. (Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads to a proliferation of lawyers which is widely regarded as a BAD THING. Finally introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my big dic. around on my bike and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general. In summary Blaine your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may be the wunder-flame the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior and I'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone who looks like you too. ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com ...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information identifying it as personal and as independent of IBM...."

"2","A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger: There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power having taken passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to ride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due in part to the fact that neither I nor my regular passengers are particularly slimline ! I always tell passengers stay in line with the bike on corners that makes their movements predictable. My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods. Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers (a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight making any kind of maneuvering difficult. I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore back. We have a code system for turns stop and for 'I need to shift position'. -- Chris Seabrook Fujitsu Open Systems Solutions Inc | Phone: +1-510-652-6200x118 6121 Hollis Street Emeryville CA 94608-2092 USA | Fax:   +1-510-652-5532 | DoD:    #0861 Per saltire gules and Or a sun counterchanged."
"2","Unable to stand the pain anymore my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT. It came with no instructions but it came 2 weeks earlier than they said it would.  Installation would have been very easy but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that out the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest though does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the backrest angle does not fit and I have not yet found a suitable hard ( SAE grade 8 or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back. The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable enough but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat without a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the volume of foam that the stock seat has and from my short test it seems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit but I've not has enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a small pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 10 taller seat. If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville Pinkham & Smugglers) I'll give a more complete report but in general it seems like an improvement. -- Frank Evan Perdicaro 				Xyvision Color Systems Legalize guns drugs and cash...today.		101 Edgewater Drive inhouse: frank@marvin x5572				Wakefield MA outhouse: frank@contex.com 617-245-4100x5572		018801285"

"2","Hi. I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable. They are.  There's a space between each link where the teeth of the locking head notch in.  Thus each link is a possible locking point. Also (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks LOOK a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence as long as the lock is nominally functional. Finally I notice that when I ride with my leathers harness boots and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW I've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae) cagers give me a much wider berth don't hassle me and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights. I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur. (I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e. on my body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).

I was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and force it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release and become momentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's disorientation the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally run like the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really pissed. OOOOOOOpsssss. For a second there I thought I was in rec.beatthelivingcrapoutofadog and not rec.motorcycles. Till next time. ***************************************************************************** *  Mike Maser                | DoD#= 0536 | SQUID RATING: 5.333333333333333 * *  9235 Pinetree Rd.         |----------------------------------------------* *  Sidney B.C.

One of the major causes of mirror breakage is impact with the pavement. Laws mandating that all mirrors be protected by helmets might be in order. But seriously... One place to put a helmet is on a preferably clean footpeg hanging from the chin-guard away from any hot pipes. Ed DoD #1110"

"2","I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend. I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long riding down Rt. 40 in Groton Ma.  At the side of the road sitting off on the shoulder was the killer Volvo in question.  No brake lights no turn signal nothing.  We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front of me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  Well as said cage passes the Volvo the Brain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around...  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not T-bone it and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up.  As she finishes the turn she looks up at me with a completely blank uncomprehending stare.

"2","Hello Folks I'm very happy with my new R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons... that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect it's more a torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still (when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay here are my questions: 1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds (70 mph) yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas. 2) I run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it really picks up the periphery (deer lurking etc.)  Combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm puttering around in the dirt at low RPM? 3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section of the paper and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives... Yeah right.  What do you folks due to keep the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

"2","Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that I am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my Zephyr too. If I can sell it this month great ... insurance and tags both run out in a couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens. It's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer plus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactly one year ago (Apr '92) it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and a luggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance no bullshit.   I'll spare any further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it and (2) somebody 5'7 +/- 5 will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people but not a small bike.  Standard upright positioning and good-looking.  Smooth power great brakes good Karma. - Erik /-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\ |                                                                | |     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      | | '90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               | | '86 BMW R80GS                                                  | \-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/"
"2",">I eagerly await comment. The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the driveway when she sees me coming. Probably only hits 25mph or so. (I made the mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge now.) I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came flashing through the brush at well over 30mph on an intercept course with my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from my left and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph from the other direction. I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off the front bumper smacking the asphalt and getting runover by the front tire. It managed a pretty good yelp just before impact. (peripheral imminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back home but I haven't seen it since. Sniff. Sometimes Fate sees you and smiles. -Rick"

If by quick wiggle |to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right |before turning to the left what is the input to the steering |mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old |shove-shove? Well as many a bored bike tourer can tell you the way to steer sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean. Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left. To do this you have to push against something and the only thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the ground will push you right back.  So you pushed yourself off to the left by pushing on the ground to the right and the ground pushed back toward the left.  Well that push is on both wheels. The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly which had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end) but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel toward the left at the contact patch the trail will cause the wheel to turn to the right.  Hey there we are.  No-hands counter- steering.

"2","In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap that is going on in the MOA (which some folks took not as dissemination of information that I received but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that I would post this one which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words O.K. guys? April 4 1993 re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement Dear Chick: We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the Owners News) is 968 words nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws.  In pertinent part the rules state: Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length. Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's statement been cut as required it would have concluded approximately with the word undertiding [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement.  As a result Cecil has obtained what I view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election. Parenthetically in your private correspondence with others I would be most appreciative that when tou call me an asshole you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences. With kind regards I remain Robert Higdon O.K. MOA'ers You read it think for yourself I trust you do know who Cecil King is and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass and he is a pres. candidate.  I let you draw your own conclusions. Regards Craig Vechorik BMW MOA Ambassador #9462 BMW Vintage Bulletin Tech Editor DOD #843 REAL BMW's have TWO Wheels <-- politically correct statement"

For what it's worth I got my can in three days from Chaparral. That's UPS ground from CA to UT YMMV. The stuff seems to work and it doesn't attract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test a full day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the sand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with sand at the end of the day but the chain looked pretty clean. As far as mail-order goes if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can tell you if it's in stock or about how long it will take to back-order it if it's not) I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories always seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory Warehouse also takes a week or two and after trying to buy some boots from them last week I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was about $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots but on Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week so I asked MAW a completely unreasonable question: Do you have them in stock? The conversation went something like this: I need to know if you have some boots in stock. Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard? I want to know if you have them in stock. Well the computer doesn't show anything I'd have to call the distributer to find out if we have them. So do you have them or not? Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not. Uh right. So can you do it? Yea call me back in an hour and ask for Phil. So an hour later Phil isn't there but Mike says he'll check and call him back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month (3 weeks away). Screw it the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock: Ooh Alpinestars? Probably not they are hard to keep in stock but I'll check. What size? Size 10. Let's see yes! Size 10 in blue & white gray & white black... I'll take the blacks! This was about noon on Monday they arrived Thursday morning. Once again three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral. I'm not completely down on MAW they often have lower prices but be prepared to wait. Oh and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff Scorcher seems like a good outfit friendly fast had the tires I wanted in stock and were cheaper than Chaparral too. -- Blaine Gardner @ Evans & Sutherland bgardner@dsd.es.com"

Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order.  The were aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the grip itself.  Wires ran outside of the bars from the grips to a switch and finaly the battery.  Cycle Magazine tested them YEARS ago and liked them. Dunno if they are still made.

I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds in the winter at a light when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never had occasion to do it on a bike but I imagine that it would be even easier because you could slip beside the car in front.

Suggestions? If you had been looking in your mirror you would have seen the guy coming before you heard the screeching tires. When you're stopped at a light: 1)  Stop so that you're got space in front of you and a quick easy escape route (between lanes into a crosswalk up a driveway somewhere) if someone decides they want to plow into you. 2)  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars are stopped behind you so you don't have to waste a second you don't have trying to get it in gear if you need to move. 3)  Watch your mirrors.  In that situation most of the hazards you are trying to avoid are coming from behind you.  SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak) isn't just for when you're moving.

"2","Orating with wild abandon prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (Henry Prange) offers: %The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem %in the summer. Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that. I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer. My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'. This has been complained about by every reviewer official and unofficial that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things just get a bit nippy but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable effect I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature about right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it I received a consoling pat on the back and their sincere apologies for the poor design (actually I was told they worked just like they were suppose to).

It will depress the foam liner in the helmet.  That is not the kind of foam that bounces back like foam rubber.  Its purpose in life is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin. If your mirror compresses it there is that much less energy absorbing capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash. I found the right handlebar to be a good spot if on the sidestand. Hang with the chinbar facing up balanced across the grip and brake lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the chinbar foam.

OK (but I'm right!)  :^) >The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the >front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being >that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. If that's the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to that also don't teach countersteering I have to question the quality of the classes.  The official line in MSF curricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it and increasing braking on the front as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift. The official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0. >>Saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless >>advice to a newbie.  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out >>where that is!  It also gives him zero information from which to >>develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and >>corresponding weight shift develop. > >If you don't slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether you've >achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always >aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the >limits of the machine you have to go beyond them. Not necessarily true.  Chirping the tire indicates impending lockup (on most surfaces) and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used to use. >In any case for maximum braking if (as I suggested) you aim to keep >both wheels just on the point of sliding then you'll be doing >exactly as *you* suggest!! True but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills (which is how this discussion started) keep both wheels just on the point of sliding is nearly useless information.  You need to teach a *technique* or at least a strategy to achieve this. --- Ed Green former Ninjaite |I was drinking last night with a biker Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM   |and I showed him a picture of you.

"2","I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot that is if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on hard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible leaving Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and luggage. Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit off the back is hard to fight. Similarly I held on to the grab handles tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm a lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for him to manage. On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself I absolutely refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's helmet jacket gloves stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's not my responsibility to provide this gear but it's my responsibility to require it if they want to ride. And I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried many passengers before take a few gentler rides of some duration before you head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton.

"2","My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you. This time it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually the dog encountered me with intent to harm. But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch about thirty feet away heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog and before you could say SIPDE he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back but my memory of this moment is hazy. I next turned around and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin and no cool battle scars! Interestingly the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember. What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end? I eagerly await comment.

"2","I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet) but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front 350 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18 and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase. The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front a Metzler Touring Special 4.10 H 18 and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18 (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities? The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices. I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back both in MBS variety if possible (the longer lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front and like it and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments? A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be careful any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type. On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing and I will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.) -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company------- edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division MS475 (208)323-2174   P.O.

If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase most noticeably in lower rpm range torque.

It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock but unlike a U lock it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large rectangle (longer length than any U lock I have seen plus it folds down to real small) so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs I have large muscular thighs and no I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the waist and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over and when I tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well). I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks. Also even though it's related to convienience you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight) stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit) and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually if I know I'll be running errands I just wear my V-Pilot jacket but that's just me... As far as crash protection I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe not. So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

Spring break I went through the four corners area and back.  The most beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this is a bit further east than where you appear to be going I highly recommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It was not well marked but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was heading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place I should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK and not the recreation area.  Heading north from Monticello it is the second turnoff and may have been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is about 20 (dirt if this matters to you) miles past the Needles overlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably maintained (I ran it about 70mph). Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on the world.  If it isn't too far out of your way you should see it.

"2","A few months ago in one the the motorcycle mags there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru BMW.  The idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight and reflect in other colors at night to headlights.  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction. I talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector was it being used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware of anything regarding self applied tape.

"2","Grr. Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today. Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after work only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the ride was very zen. Got up this morning needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work on her computers with rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got home. Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry I said to heck with it and drove my cage back up. Lo and Behold those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm yellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes into the trip. And me in my cage. Oh JOY. Happily my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the bike when I first got it put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the entire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing through it plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors so you get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but annoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing them this afternoon. 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned 2 D-Cell Flashlight headlight. Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? Since the charging system on the CB360T can't handle continuous use of a 50W halogen headlight I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do but wouldn't drain the battery during normal use (chiefly day trips and commuting to work and back)..."

First it has to be the first really nice riding day of spring.  The bike is back together again and so are you.  Grab all your gear put it on and fill the tank with 94 octane premium or better.  Head out. In Ames there is a road that leads to the little town of Gilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light if that tells you something. Having just gotten the bike back together I thought I'd take it for a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town I went into the twisties at a slow pace just under the speed limit and started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt just right.  Finally the road straightened and I was ready for a bit of speed.  Grab third gear open her up.  At roughly 90mph grab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can and fail to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist the throttle like a fool grab fifth gear at 130 or so and see just how well she's been put back together. At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was flexing a bit.  Thus I slowed pulled off the road removed my helmet and gloves unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny pack and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper pulled in all hot and flustered. Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going? Not precisely no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road not the instruments.  I just got her back together last night and I'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic. My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why I shouldn't give you a ticket? Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and traffic on a strait and flat road while wearing all the protective gear that safety demands? (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent) Say what kind of bike is that anyway? <I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750 a Rat Bike> Yeah I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years. <compare riding stories> <pack toolkit having tightened that fender> So why were you out here? I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through me.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone I'm dead.  If it holds up out here then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this evvery year when I rebuild her. Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway to do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway again I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get out of my sight before I write you a ticket. Yes officer. And kid keep your eyes open out there... <drives off> And that in a nut-shell is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer I'll supply one. Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering.  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to occur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle than a bicycle though because of the extra weight.  (Ok so my motorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.) -David"

It's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast acceleration is because we're holding onto something and leaning forward.  Remember this. - On turns have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally this means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up. Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous. - On slowing and stopping do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again it's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is because we're holding onto something and leaning forward.  However you'll figure it out fast because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you which shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location. - Generally have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike not out wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip. - When you passenger is in fear she will squeeze her knees against you. Normally this means slow down and do it now!. > turning so she leans *with* me but what else?  Are there traditional > signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.??? We only have a couple signals.  Slow down is her either tapping me on the back or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency of the matter :-) Turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is also the sign for cool!  Look at that.  I hafta pee is the same sign as turn here.  I'm hungry is the same sign.  Go faster is usually done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see slow down more often than go faster. > I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that > she'll want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated... The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy and pillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating because you're in almost no control.  Now multiply that feeling times ten because you as a rider know what your bike will do and your passenger will likely feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time or lock up the brakes at any moment or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain etc. Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad. Also remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up than by yourself because you're concentrating on much more and in the Zen of the moment less.

Are there traditional 1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension adjust it to a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves. 2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are: a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP sign not when she thinks you're gonna crash never. Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike. b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And (added bonus for you here) she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this. c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't lean your body into curves just go with the bike and stay perpendicular. Don't look over your shoulder.* 3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That means don't pop the clutch and try to corner and stop smoother than usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake you're going to have the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind so be prepared for that. 4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself. 5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet) and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at. * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended look over the rider's shoulder in curves bit and it just didn't work. The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because unlike the Ninja the upright riding position really restricts the pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain perpendicular to the bike and I could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs. -- Curtis Jackson	   cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com	'91 Hawk GT	'81 Maxim 650 DoD#0721 KotB  '91 Black Lab mix Studley Doright  '92 Collie/Golden George There is no justification for taking away individuals' freedom in the guise of public safety. -- Thomas Jefferson"

This was a special order. I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder after about two blocks. I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel a HD padlock for the steering lock a Master padlock to lock the cover to two front spokes and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a post in an underground parking garage. Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on me bike. When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home. By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much and the inner tubes were free.

"2","Okay DoD'ers here's a goddamn mystery for ya ! Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible thunk.  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc. and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bank-follower or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery. The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously. Okay all you engineering types how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact to let the stud rip out then changes back to a solid ?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime life goes on without a left-hand bank-follower. Barry Manor DoD# 620 confused accidental peg-scraper"

I stuck some  gun-gum into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike. So last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold  the sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat hole of Calcutta at the time!) the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering you  at the back!) but the pipe is a bit loose.

So I stuff in a bit of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best gun-gum  and come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?

"2","I have a 1974 Honda CB360T which for most of my purposes runs well. However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. That is on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I'm lucky if I can hold speed.  If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm power drops drastically.  Put simply under load the engine won't rev past 5000 rpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing still the engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K). Other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in the engine becomes a little wavery.  That is at a steady throttle the engine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 miles on it and is in good tune at least until it starts to balk. I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. My thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  I'm hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth the hassle of any major engine work.

Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with molded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type and it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing it (no broken parts but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after spreading the zipper pull jaws again I tried with Vice-Grips. No not the usual Grip Of Death technique I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so they were snug on the zipper jaws then released them and tightened the adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right amount of Zipper Squish (TM). >Result: I now know that noplace in Spokane will even _consider_ trying >to repair a broken zipper-closer-thingy which must be a $0.30 part >which needs a $20 tool to install. I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the Accessory Ellipse) and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of charge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses but parts ARE available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple just break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop. You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement parts.

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping no doubt with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger. The other ~5 lb is of course dog poop but that varies all over the place as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me). > You have I presume thumbs?

It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective would no longer measure torque accurately and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.

Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive > manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable? Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't used their brakes at all prior to impact. I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you ever use and to practice it constantly even when you have no need to do any turning.  If you follow me down a long straight and I seem to be wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need it's because I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in my path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile but if I have even milliseconds to react the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking with the front brake of course. Chuck Rogers car377@torreys.att.com"

Doesn't sound like they attended though does it?  In fact if we riders need friends it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from Lynn's description especially if the same crowd gets invited back to party some more year after year. > Sure you didn't rape and pillage-- It's a relief to know that you were > such gentlemen-- but because you were not completely out-of-hand you > justify your lesser indescretions?  Some pretty distorted thinking I > should say. You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these lesser indiscretions.  If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the indiscretions and the partyers aren't either maybe the indiscretions don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans in the street but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they helped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation and good intentions I'd certainly rather they stick around and party than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed. > Oh-- I'm sorry I just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in MONEY)... > Nevermind my criticism I was out of line.

Ironically these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.

Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel. >I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you >really in actuality avoid such an incident?  Suggestions? The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and stall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear. So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line. (Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't split (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not! So in summary position yourself for an easy exit and then watch your mirrors until it's all clear. -- Paul Thompson    Apple Computer"

Now I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of money and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.

"2","This summer (~July 20) my wife (Michelle) and I will be in Boston attending my brother's wedding.  After the wedding we are planning to motor up to Bar Harbor Maine to visit some relatives for a few days.  Our summer would be *made* if we could find a bike (or bikes) to borrow or rent to ride up to Bar Harbor and back. Here's some important details:  I've been riding for ~11 years (my own bikes for the past 7 years) Michelle has been riding for the past 6 years (her own bikes) I've only been involved in one accident which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign I currently own a BMW R90 Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago 700 we prefer cruising over racing we've toured a fair amount we're both licensed and insured and we're nice people. So if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-) but the second one would have to be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they would be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in July Michelle and I would be eternally grateful. In addition to our friendship you would also have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis. In exchange we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner and an evening of wild bike stories or we might even be willing to cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s) like new tires or something. Also any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Scott Brandt"

"2","Yesterday a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years) and I myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of SQUILDLY behavior by other customers and/or sales personel: BACKGROUND: I ride with a group of friends who mainly are into cruiser type bikes. My friend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He wanted to see what the new ones were going for so we happened upon a dealer that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. The place was fairly busy so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few Intruders most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten. Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat I moseid on outside. The next thing I know I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in. I could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat oakley IQ <40) but I won't. Well they went inside I didn't think much of it. I figured to each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back  when I noticed the hormone gang talking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter jokes etc. No big deal. Here is the part that concerned me. The HG and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out where said HG members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive. SQUIDS I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager not only condoned this behavior but encourged it to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike seemed rather hormonal about this display and urged her pilot to quickly catch up. The others followed making sure there Kerkers could be heard as well as felt. I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those in cages witnessing this display then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels. Needless to say my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left. I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully to clear my anger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home has an open mind and doesn't associate me with them. BTW I can't afford a new bike....."
