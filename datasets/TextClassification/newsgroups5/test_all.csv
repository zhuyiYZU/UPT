X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab space newline) and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces though it is not a X    requirement.  Also if possible try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested but not required that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something put it in the ---remark--- section or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files use multiple X	  ---info--- sections one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title followed by an optional X	       digit followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title possibly followed X       by a digit followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed. X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid setgid super-user X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal education or non-profit use is Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel. X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests.  In certain X    cases a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand given X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry.  And sometimes X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C such as K&R C you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[string];   <--- use string[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h> use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define #if #ifdef ...) X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#' many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason we look for X    programs that are compact and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point) because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program we tend to favor the second version.  Of course a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a libXaw.a libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif Xv*ew or OpenL*ok toolkits since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier) so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases X	where this program differs from the contest rules the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient however X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6 pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X    and/or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub-directory say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something put it in the X    ---remark--- section or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u +%a %h %d %T 19%y X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files and shred all related paper.  By tradition we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s) if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary. X X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X    by a similar but slightly better entry.  For this reason it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes of course X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not we select a small entry (usually one line) a X    strange/creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (The New Hackers Dictionary) and on T-Shirts. X X    Last but not least winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

Xt Glossary ---------------------------------------------------------------------- o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object RectObj Core Composite Constraint Shell OverrideShell WMShell etc.  The terms Xt and Intrinsics are used interchangeably however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X window system.  In particular it does not include the Athena Motif OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the Intrinsics are not especially useful. o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The precise use is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the Object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets. o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib functions because Xt provides most such services although an understanding of Xlib helps with problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In brief Xlib Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up. Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used. How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information. /* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */ #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h> typedef struct { Visual	*visual; int	depth; } OptionsRec; OptionsRec	Options; XtResource resources[] = { {visual Visual XtRVisual sizeof (Visual *) XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec visual) XtRImmediate NULL} {depth Depth XtRInt sizeof (int) XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec depth) XtRImmediate NULL} }; XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { {-visual *visual XrmoptionSepArg NULL} {-depth *depth XrmoptionSepArg NULL} }; int main (argc argv) int		argc; char		**argv; { XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ Display		*dpy;		/* display */ char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ Arg		args[10]; Cardinal	cnt; char		*name = test; char		*class = Test; /* * save the command line arguments */ xargc = argc; xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); bcopy ((char *) argv (char *) xargv argc * sizeof (char *)); /* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. */ cnt = 0; top = XtAppInitialize (&app class Desc XtNumber (Desc) &argc argv (String *) NULL args cnt); dpy = XtDisplay (top); cnt = 0; XtGetApplicationResources (top &Options resources XtNumber (resources) args cnt); cnt = 0; if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) { XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNvisual Options.visual); ++cnt; /* * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could * use a default colormap based on the class of the * visual; we could examine some property on the * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could * do all sorts of things... */ colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)) Options.visual AllocNone); XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNcolormap colormap); ++cnt; /* * Now find some information about the visual. */ vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy VisualIDMask &vinfo &count); if (vinfo_list && count > 0) { XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNdepth vinfo_list[0].depth); ++cnt; XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); } } XtDestroyWidget (top); /* * Now create the real toplevel widget. */ XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNargv xargv); ++cnt; XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNargc xargc); ++cnt; top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL class applicationShellWidgetClass dpy args cnt); /* * Display the application and loop handling all events. */ XtRealizeWidget (top); XtAppMainLoop (app); return (0); } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such). Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome. As an example on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome 256 entry colormap static gray static color and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor 24 bit TrueColor an Overlay Plane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell. A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen() DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree. If the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See section 2.8 of the Xt specification. It eventually does get destroyed just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have completed before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d among other things. As some further caveats/trivia the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used such as calling exit() directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets temporary files allocated X resources etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget): Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget		top; for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); } void ExitCallback (gw closure call_data) Widget		gw;		/* widget */ XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ { Widget		toplevel; toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); exit (0); } One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur. This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks. One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain practices. Try the following code instead. #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> extern Widget ToplevelGet ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget		gw #endif ); extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes XtPointer	closure #endif ); extern void ExitCallback ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget		gw XtPointer	closure XtPointer	call_data #endif ); Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget		top; for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); } void ExitCallback (gw closure call_data) Widget		gw;		/* widget */ XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ { Widget		toplevel; toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw) ExitWorkProc (XtPointer) NULL); } Boolean ExitWorkProc (closure) XtPointer	closure; { exit (0); /*NOTREACHED*/ } ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- After it is realized one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize. To change the position of a Shell use XtSetValues() on the Shell not the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It does however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call. How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is tail -f filename. It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular: - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while (several thousand times) and then stop until some other event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this. - Pyramid doesn't work at all. - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets) wasn't completely broken but although the writing side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks (get raound it by detecting the situation and having select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had been given the whole block). Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read() file descriptor pipes etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete which means its a 1000 pages.

What Widgets are available? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are three popular widget sets: Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently a 3d look is available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think it is poorly implemented. OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality. I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get. In addition the following collection of widgets are also available: Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph stacked bar graph line graph pie chart xy plot hypertext help spreadsheet and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen them so I can't comment. FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor FileDialog and a few others.  The current set of widgets can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so widely used. Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. Again a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/* The following specialized widgets are also available: Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).

What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- __________________________________________ Name		Language	Vendor __________________________________________ Xview		C		Sun OI		C++		ParcPlace Interviews	C++		Stanford Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu __________________________________________ However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) typdef struct { String	name; long	value; } Arg; and the code: Arg	arg; XtSetArg (arg name 3.2) expands to Arg	arg; arg.name = name; arg.value = 3.2; you can see that with normal C type conversions the arg.value gets the integer 3 instead of the floating point value 3.2.  When the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So how to get around this? The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions. #define XtSetFloatArg(arg n d) \ if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \ XtSetArg(arg n &(d)); \ } else { \ XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \ XtSetArg(arg n *ld); \ } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com): The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values. There are several main types of resource converters: string to data type data type to string data type to data type i) string to data type Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values: Name		Value True		1 False		0 In this case the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values. If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many converters each with a small number of enumeration strings) then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks.  That way the first time one of these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters. ii) data type to string This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead the data type value is simply converted to a string value probably by the use of sprintf. Data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms. If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent. iii) data type to data type This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type.  For instance an X pixel value can be converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for red green and blue. The type signature for a resource converter is as follows: typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display * XrmValuePtr Cardinal * XrmValuePtr XrmValuePtr XtPointer *); Display *dpy; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; XrmValuePtr fromVal; XrmValuePtr toVal; XtPointer *converter_data; When the converter is invoked the fromVal argument points to the source X resource manager value and the toVal argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The converter_data argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The args and num_args arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel. Care must be taken with the toVal argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value: typedef struct { unsigned int    size; caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue *XrmValuePtr; When the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True. If the location is NULL then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True. When writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro: #define DONE(var type) \ if (toVal->addr) \ { \ if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return False; \ } \ else \ *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return True; #define DONESTR(str) \ if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return False; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return True; Inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the num_args and args arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly. Once you have written your converter you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database. To register a converter with a single application context use XtAppSetTypeConverter: void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context from to converter args num_args cache destructor) XtAppContext context; String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor; To register a converter with all application contexts use XtSetTypeConverter: void XtSetTypeConverter(from to converter args num_args cache destructor) String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor; In the R3 Intrinsics there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible the newer routines should be used. When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics a cache argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached: XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions). The destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition: typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext XrmValuePtr XtPointer XrmValuePtr Cardinal *); XtAppContext context; XrmValuePtr to; XtPointer converter_data; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the to argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered. Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution: mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See Multi-user Application Software Using Xt The X Resource Issue 3 (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context. The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways: 1. User selects a quit button on one of the displays 2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message 3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message server shutdown/crash or network failure. I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not then read the Oliver Jones article. The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem. The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this: #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover; void XIOHandler (dpy) Display		*dpy; { destroyDisplay (dpy); longjmp (XIOrecover 1); } main () { ... if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); XtAppMainLoop (app_context); } The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay(). For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate. Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor BadAtom or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display. There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First the general changes for each release are described.  Then a certainly incomplete list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority): 1. Args passed at creation time. 2. Command line arguments. 3. User's per host defaults file 4. User's defaults file. 5. User's per application default file. 6. System wide per application default file. Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries. The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used. The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically the program xrdb is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not. A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following 6/92] You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): %N	The value of the filename parameter or the application's class name. %T	The value of the file type.  In this case the literal string app-defaults %C	customization resource (R5 only) %S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L	Language locale and codeset (e.g. ja_JP.EUC) %l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ja) %t	The territory part of the display's language string %c	The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is Myterm. Also suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11 then in /usr/openwin. Let's consider another example. This time let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly. NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless. With R5 there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example you might run the myterm application like this: myterm -xrm *customization: -color If one of your pathname specifications had the value /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C then the expanded pathname would be /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is <root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%N%C:\     (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N: <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to . a single dot.  In R3 all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ./ a dot followed by a slash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92) The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution. The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list. Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says: callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended. you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92) > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However if my window is iconified the flag > stays set to TRUE. Right everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a deficiency in the X protocol and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The deficiency is that the information is available in one way in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2 so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification. A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual. > Is this a problem with mwm or is there something > else which needs to be done? You'll see this with any window manager with no window manager. > If the problem is mwm what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified? As an application writer keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can't. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc XtFree etc? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately most code that calls malloc() realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like: ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) if (!ptr) { perror (malloc in xyzzy()); exit (1) } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc() XtCalloc() XtNew() XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc() calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits. In addition if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like: if (!ptr) ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); else ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); ++count; to be written as: ptr = XtRealloc (ptr sizeof (ptr) * ++count); Also XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors. XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string: struct abc *xyzzy; char	     *ptr; char	     *str = abcdef; xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ ptr = XtNewString (str); A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as: char	      *ptr; ptr = XtMalloc (100); /* ... */ free (ptr); may not work.  Personally I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor. A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree(). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First I'd recomend getting purify from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info). Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers.  These instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors such as reading unitialized memory writing past malloc'd bounds or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program including third party and vendor object-code libraries and verifies system call interfaces.  In addition Purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five. An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun) runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is The SENTINEL Debugging Environment.  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info) Next if you are getting any sort of Xlib error you'll need to run in synchronous mode easily accomplished with the -sync command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous. Next if you are having trouble with window layout you can use the undocumented resource xtIdentifyWindows or the class resource XtDebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example: example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' & example% xwininfo -tree <click in new xload window> will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets. Next if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea. The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped. The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine and running the application on the other possibly using a command sequence like this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0; thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger. or this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% gdb application (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 (gdb) run ... I believe CodeCenter a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints. Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput() XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly. I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect but in my real application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3 R4 and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts you won't get those events. For example: ... cnt = 0; toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app class Desc XtNumber (Desc) &argc argv Fallback args cnt); XtAddTimeOut (...) XtAddWorkProc (...) XtAppMainLoop (app) would never invoke the timeout. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93) Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients in an ``intuitive'' fashion. Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other and so far as I know they are not published. I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a standard drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt). The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions for more details read the code. I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway. The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib. -- Pete Ware					ware@cis.ohio-state.edu CIS Dept Ohio State University			w/ (614) 292-7318 228 Bolz Hall 2036 Neil Ave.			h/ (614) 538-0965 Columbus OH 43210"

"1","Hi I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine and I'm observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a DrawingArea. Namely some Xlib operations work and some do not. In particular the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some XDrawPoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction. Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug? Thanks Zack T. Smith"

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests.  In certain X    cases a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand given X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry.  And sometimes X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C such as K&R C you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      | X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[string];   <--- use string[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h> use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define #if #ifdef ...) X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#' many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason we look for X    programs that are compact and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point) because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program we tend to favor the second version.  Of course a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a libXaw.a libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif Xv*ew or OpenL*ok toolkits since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier) so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases X	where this program differs from the contest rules the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient however X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6 pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X    and/or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub-directory say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something put it in the X    ---remark--- section or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u +%a %h %d %T 19%y X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files and shred all related paper.  By tradition we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s) if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary. X X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X    by a similar but slightly better entry.  For this reason it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes of course X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not we select a small entry (usually one line) a X    strange/creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (The New Hackers Dictionary) and on T-Shirts.

X X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984 this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see The New Hacker's Dictionary by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets perhaps even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus? XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network type graph with automatic layout capability.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X due out last February :-) has full support for C++. I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated a variety of other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different ways and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop internationalization etc.).

This can be a chicken and egg sort of problem however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ there is an example that should show how it can be done.

Please reply via e-mail. They aren't functions they are character arrays. The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it undefined so simply recompile one or the other.

"1","I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is run more than once on a display the tones are buffered in the X server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this e.g. by emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits? - Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the JET project."

The ability to program was >an entry requirement. At Robert Gordon University programming was the main (most time-consuming) start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX) Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler) Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog) Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors). The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2) Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler) Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this? BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README: This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates Wc - Widget Creation resource files and this distribution also includes the Widget Creation Library (version 1.06 with the exception of the demos and Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README dirt.A2.0.tar.Z and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175). Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool. Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components for which it generates C/UIL code.

This FAQ includes information on a number of gotchas that can bite you on particular system. However the best source of general information on building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled separately from the rest of the release so if it's become separated from your sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[msPSTXT] at the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the xstuff mail server. In addition O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5? Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym etc.? If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined link with libdl.a.  Add -ldl to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to surround it with -Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable since syslibs get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile the stubs shared.) [thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM) 12/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2? In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling -Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic appears to work. To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt) please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: Patch i.d.      Description 100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu [Greg Earle earle@Sun.COM; 7/92] A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93] contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution but I get several segmentation faults when running X. Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms. Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or return structs run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and the server. This is from the GCC manual: On the Sparc GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference. This really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in GNU CC so it isn't straightforward to fix it. The convention for structure returning is also incompatible and `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help. You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags. Files which need to be compiled using cc include: server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c rgb/rgb.c In addition several of the inet_ functions use structs as args or return values: clients/xhost/xhost.c clients/xauth/gethost.c. Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. Fatal server bug! no screens found. Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do this simple test: #include <sys/ioctl.h> SIOCGIFCONF Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i' your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are identical try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files. [courtesy der Mouse mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3? In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c we have found missing defines for CG3AC_MONOLEN CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_ENBLEN CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be? The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile: #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024) #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN However the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device and so references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the Imakefile.  [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found. Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied from another distribution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results: ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even: ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun remember that you need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server run it on the server's clients too).  While building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation. If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib /usr/local/lib or /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined) This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface). A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against. [10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis (jpf@heliocentric.com)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole? There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries; to avoid the problem do one of these: 1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site. 2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). 3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries. [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler) 12/90] The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole? On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console display. Check the man page for fbtab(5). [Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 106)  What is Imake? Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not specific to X the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. Imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files system-independent configuration files and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious. There have been several different versions of imake; the R3 R4 and R5 versions are different. You can obtain information on imake from these sources: - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information - on the R4 tapes contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake. - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of send imake-stuff help to almanac@primate.wisc.edu. - see System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe? by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert. - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article Das Meta-Make / I make you make / Schwerelos by Rainer Klute in iX Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal issue 2:1. - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake. - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z. [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake? Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such configuration files although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5. export contains the R5 distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. A stand-alone version of Imake but one stemming from X11R5 is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do? If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system run xmkmf. This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make which will use that new Makefile to compile the program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs I get the following link error: Undefined: _XShapeQueryExtension _XShapeCombineMask These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers as well as many vendor-supplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway. In order to use the shape extension you must link to the library libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files do not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries. [from John B. Melby melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net 3/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with _XtInherit not found on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit. What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently you can't share a function that is both called and compared as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is in Initialize.c where XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called. You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed just linked in. 2) alternatively your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView program. In this case you can remove -lXt from your link command. It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the problem. [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under the current version of X I get this message: Undefined: _XtScrollBarSetThumb _XtTextSetInsertionPoint _XtTextReplace There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)? The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this you must set up what are called hints for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based you can use something like the following: XWMHints wmhints; ... wmhints.flags = InputHint; wmhints.input = True; XSetWMHints(dpy window &wmhints) If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics you can set the XtNinput resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'. Certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having this done. If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant. OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running? You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case. For most cases you shouldn't care which window manager is running so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available? There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. In X the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just this one little thing include contrib/clients/xskel a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions and the Xlib Hello World example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90] In addition a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)? The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this: { Arg args[3]; int i; int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */ i=0; XtSetArg (args[i] XtNsensitive &sensitive); i++; XtGetValues(widget args i ); ... } But XtNsensitive is a Boolean which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable sensitive as Boolean works properly. This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work? You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising functions XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest() are also for use only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted. [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx XtNy XtNwidth or XtNheight.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow? Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget. Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David B.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. In general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget? XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt? It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a yes answer the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(Widget w XtPointer client XtPointer call) { int             answer; answer = AskUser(w Really Quit?); if (RET_YES == answer) { answer = AskUser(w Are You Really Positive?); if (RET_YES == answer) exit(0); } } A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for OK Cancel and Help or equivalents: int AskUser(w string) Widget          w; char           *string; { int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */ Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry but ...*/ Arg             args[3]; int             n = 0; XtAppContext    context; n=0; XtSetArg(args[n] XmNmessageString XmStringCreateLtoR(string XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++; XtSetArg(args[n] XmNdialogStyle XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w) string args n); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNokCallback response &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNcancelCallback response &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNhelpCallback response &answer); XtManageChild(dialog); context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w); while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) { XtAppProcessEvent (context XtIMAll); } XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } The dialog supports three buttons which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w client call) Widget          w; XtPointer client; XtPointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case XmCR_OK: *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */ break; case XmCR_CANCEL: *answer = RET_NO; break; case XmCR_HELP: *answer = RET_HELP; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is. Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects. If you are still using R3 you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt including R4. #include <X11/CoreP.h> #include <X11/Xresource.h> String XtName (widget) Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */ { return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); } [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program: > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...widgetClass...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...window...);	/* produces error */ The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (no window) could create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage? The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it you can take the following steps to avoid the error: 1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events the copy wasn't clean and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server: display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); if (display) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display by convention or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY if set]. This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a busy cursor while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application? The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute toplevel with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window): unsigned long valuemask; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask); attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel) XC_watch); /* The window will be as big as the display screen and clipped by its own parent window so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel) XtWindow(toplevel) 0 0 65535 65535 (unsigned int) 0 0 InputOnly CopyFromParent valuemask &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. When you want to use this busy cursor map and raise this window; to go back to normal unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. In addition note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then immediately in the child process close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. Alternatively before exec'ing make this call which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec.

No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing) it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.

You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler or more likely if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket pipe or file input? It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor. A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. Most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: if (ioctl(fd FIONREAD &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event. If you're sending events to your own application then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server. Depending on how well the widget was written you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want. [courtesy Mark A.

You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped: while (!done) { XNextEvent(the_display&the_event); switch (the_event.type) { case Expose:	 /* On expose events redraw */ XDrawLine(the_displaythe_windowthe_GC55100100); break; ... } } Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors so this program could previously include this code: ... the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_displaythe_screen);	/* e.g. */ the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_displaythe_screen);	/* e.g. */ the_GC = XCreateGC(the_displaythe_window GCForeground|GCBackground&the_GC_values); ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background. And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen? The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0 unix:0.1 unix:0.2 etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0 1 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection. The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. In Xt-based programs you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen. (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have Display in the names -- XDisplayWidth XDisplayHeight etc.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap set it to be the background pixmap of a window and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap) you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However this action alters the contents of the window and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent you have several choices: - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however not all servers support the extension. - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note that there is no X notion of a transparent color index. - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black for example should produce white. However the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] If you want to be combining colors with GXxor then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red say the result is blue and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red green and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using for example 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the standard colormap but it doesn't work. XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. Because X is asynchronous there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window. [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com) 4/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window? Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually the server assigns some bits the client others) and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource except for GCs and private color cells can be shared]. The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen.

[1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times? It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse) 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib? Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do client-side timeouts unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus you have to do timeouts which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the single-click action or the double-click action. [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse) 4/93] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text? Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. Your only choice if you want to stay within the core X protocol is to render the text into a pixmap read it back via XGetImage() rotate it by hand with whatever matrices you want and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically: 1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 4) for each xy in I2 I2(xy) = I(ab) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 5) render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript PEX PHiGS and GKS although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. In addition if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph. [courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) Eric Taylor (etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu) and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com) 11/90; Liam Quin (lee@sq.com) 12/90] InterViews (C++ UI toolkit in the X contrib software) has support for rendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code. [Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu) 3/91] Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests. [eric@pencom.com 10/91] The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font. The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. O'Reilly's X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 152)  What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?) There are places in the X Toolkit in applications and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names selection names selection targets resource types application classes and class extension record types; and several others. The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 tape; it is also available by sending send docs registry to the xstuff mail server. To register names (first come first served) or to ask questions send to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for confirmation.

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press.

Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels you name opaque are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea() and remember to adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin. The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask too. But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS... -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all not to be merged are 0. Then set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use GXCopy and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

The xpert mailing list is the general public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed so xpert is almost identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup. ***	If you get comp.windows.x you don't need to 	*** ***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		*** Otherwise you can join the list to receive X information electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort send mail to xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address. The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements such as new releases (including public patches from MIT) public reviews adoption of standards by the MIT X Consortium and conference announcements.  It does NOT carry advertisements source code patches or questions.  If you already receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing list you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise to subscribe send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself please contact your mail administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it. comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list. In addition the X Consortium sponsors these public lists: bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions x-ada           X and ada x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics ximage          people interested in image processing and X xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X To subscribe to one of these lists assuming no-one in your organization already receives it send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request addition request.

The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits. There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses? When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists be sure to include all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all. Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system give details of that too.  Give the machine type operating system and O/S version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager compiler and display hardware type you are using. Then tell exactly what you are doing exactly what happens and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails include the exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case please!) for readers to reproduce the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available? The trade magazines (Unix World Unix Review Computer Language etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include: - O'Reilly and Associates publishes The X Resource: A Practical Journal of the X Window System (103 Morris St. #A Sebastapol CA 95472). Editorial information: Adrian Nye adrian@ora.com. - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal Subscriber Services Dept XXX P.O. Box 3000 Denville NJ 07834 USA. Editorial information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms? Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An Xt-based program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets. Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets. Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source. Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors. Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++ but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3 as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5. CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib. XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host. XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources. RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning please locate and consult the relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual. UTSL: A common expression meaning take advantage of the fact that you aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source Luke. API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls etc. in a programming library. BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts. GUI: graphical user interface. UIL: the User Interface Language part of OSF/Motif which lets programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple outline form WCL: the Widget Creation Language a package which extends the understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 UIMS: User Interface Management System ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?) The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients you need to read and understand the ICCCM  in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager.  Get it either: - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys X Window System book - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0 X Protocol Reference Manual. A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete. The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the presentation. [from David Rosenthal 10/90] - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's Programmer's Supplement for Release 5. The complete document is on the R5 tapes. Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in RTFM and is the most-important of the least-read X documents. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium and how do I join? The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment. MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations). Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations. Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design with others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.

[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution from which this information is adapted.] [2/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif? OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF members. OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF. However there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif at the user's choice. OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications. [Thanks to Ian Darwin ian@sq.com 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows? Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager filemgr shelltool etc.). [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM) 8/90; 4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows? DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI toolkit including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager dxcalendar dxpsview etc.). (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX? PEX is the PHiGS Extension to X. PHiGS stands for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics. Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals. [last modified 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is low-bandwidth X (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP? There are several options for using X over serial lines: SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time). PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable. XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server.  There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem: (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly connected) and (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and (3)	In addition to the effects of #2 it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress. LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6. Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files: XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX [information provided by Jim Fulton jim@ncd.com; 7/92] There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers? The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout decoration and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM): wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3 uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape. twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager. awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality olwm (AT&T): ditto gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives including the one on the R5 tape vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version vtwm-5.0 is based on R5.9 and is available from export. [3/92] tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. 4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)? It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window whether or not you kill or restart your window manager. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session like toolplaces does? Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. Look for the application xplaces on an archive-server near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database. [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager? DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line naming the full pathname: sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate? You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using xset r on|off. The X protocol however doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate which is a capability not supported by all systems. Some servers running on systems that support this however may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm) you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options -ar1 350 -ar2 30 to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string? There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places just rearranges keys and does not do macro expansion. Some (few) clients including xterm and several X-based editors accept a translation resource such as: xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>F1: string(setenv DISPLAY unix:0) which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string use \nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. Window managers which could provide this facility do not yet; nor has a special remapper client been made available. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David B.

The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command: csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.] Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2 available on export [8/92] is the most recent. xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. xprint by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z. To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools you can use xpr which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output. The XV program can grab a portion of the X display manipulate it and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities. Also: Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0 an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter. ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility image-processing and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers. Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems for example have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer. Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display? If you need color PostScript in particular you can - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript such as xgrabsc and xv - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this as is the Xim package. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor? This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for e.g.  capturing the frame-buffer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X? The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps gray-scale images and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular) which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22). Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export. Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93. xv (X Image Viewer) written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley) can read and display pictures in Sun Raster PGM PBM PPM X11 bitmap TIFF GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust color intensity contrast aspect ratio crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display manipulate on it and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z. The Img Software Set by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu> reads and writes its own image format displays on an X11 screen and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z along with large collection of color images. The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-* weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-* and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*. Xim The X Image Manipulator by Philip Thompson does essential interactive displaying editing filtering and converting of images. There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif xwd xbm tiff rle xim (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications. ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM TIFF GIF SUN Raster etc) are included. xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions. A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] [some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov) 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window? The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar. A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell: echo ESC]2;TEXT^G where ESC is the escape key TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character). Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories: alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G' The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit '0' instead and use '1' to change only the icon name. Note: another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself. Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences? The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z. O'Reilly's Volume 3 the X User's Guide includes an R5 version of the control sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93 and a Motif version of the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93] Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter). In a pinch a VT100 manual will do. [last updated 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm et al fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ? In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut you need to stty pass8 but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font such as XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.] In addition you may want to set this in your shell: setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1 For a given character above 127 you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') is Alt-'. [thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea (gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small? You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give a resource specification like this: xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window this is OK as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly: xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection? You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. However a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z which can be adapted to do this. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources? You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): %N      The value of the filename parameter or the application's class name. %T      The value of the file type.  In this case the literal string app-defaults %C      customization resource (R5 only) %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L      Language locale and codeset (e.g. ja_JP.EUC) %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ja) %t      The territory part of the display's language string %c      The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is Myterm. Also suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11 then in /usr/openwin. Let's consider another example. This time let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless. With R5 there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example you might run the myterm application like this: myterm -xrm *customization: -color If one of your pathname specifications had the value /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C then the expanded pathname would be /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is <root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%N%C:\     (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N: <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to . a single dot.  In R3 all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ./ a dot followed by a slash. [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window? The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line DisplayManager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: #!/bin/sh #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste.  Note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client. [Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu) 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file? When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file the normal place you can make your .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with #!/bin/csh. If this doesn't work also try starting off with: #!/bin/sh # Reset path: PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine? There are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv DISPLAY ... whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X. One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It includes xrsh a script to start an X application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar. One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1 in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables. [11/90] In addition if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host and you find rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname) then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be xrsh <HOST> xterm #! /bin/sh # start an X11 process on another host # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu> # rsh $host -n setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null # # An improved version: # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson jr@bbn.com) #       (generalized for shksh by Keith Boyer keith@cis.ohio-state.edu) # # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

One way is to use the bitmap client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information. The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. An easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63] possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers. The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors XPM1 pixmaps and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed [5/91] in export:/contrib. If you are a MetaFont user you can use mftobdf from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK GF and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu. The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font formats. The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font. Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)? After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler installed it in some directory and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path *or* if the directory is already in the path use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.) Sometimes your xset +fp $dir command fails with a BadValue error: X Error of failed request:BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath) This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious.) -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file system?  Remember it's the server not the client which interprets your font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. xset +fp ~/myfonts) and the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm. -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file fonts.dir.  If you can't find that file run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're running OpenWindows look for the file Families.list.  If you can't find it run bldfamily(1).) -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows for example) make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using. Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files it won't work for Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files it won't work for X11Rn. [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  40)  How do I convert a .snf font back to .bdf font? A tool called snftobdf 1.4 is part of the bdftools package which is available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format? der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be used as an anything-to-BDF converter but requires access to a server that can understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91] In addition the R5 program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server? The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers which do not use the MIT font scheme. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add .bdf fonts to my DECwindows server? The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the .pcf format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts with a performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this: xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because of this writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com) 4/90] However: A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap. The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs including the GWM window manager by AT&T in its olpixmap editor and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM distribution available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works. You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first item like this: basic*text.translations:  #override \ Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \n\ Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line() ^ extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation definition. [Thanks to Timothy J. Horton 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones? One solution is xchron in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x which can show the time for timezones other than the local one. Alternatively you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock or use a script similar to this: #!/bin/sh TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name San_Luis_Obispo_CA 2> /dev/null & TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name King_Of_Prussia_PA 2> /dev/null & ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  47)  I have xmh but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH? The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list of various ftp uucp e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z. If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list you can request a copy of the FAQ which also includes a section on xmh by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server? After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started no other clients are able to connect to it. The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3 at least) delete old (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix which contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add ! -type s to the find exclusion in the cron job. [10/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen? The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens sorry. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun? Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available. The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z . The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se. [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se) 8/92] A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X? Generally report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly from MIT please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.] [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu> 5/91; 12/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get Warning: Widget class version mismatch? This error which typically goes on to say widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003 indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure. However the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems in particular were shipped with the flawed version of the library and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster? Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster it asked that server sites close off external access. [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in pub/webster/NeXT-2.0.] Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access you are probably out of luck. However if you are a legitimate site you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability illegality and non-availability of dictionary servers.

No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not public domain which has a specific legal meaning. However the X distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee. Contributed software though may be placed in the public domain by individual authors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3 R4 and R5? What changes are there? The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree. [Stephen Gildea 1/92] The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)? Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from Software Center Technology Licensing Office Massachusetts Institute of Technology 28 Carleton Street Room E32-300 Cambridge MA 02142-1324 phone: 617-258-8330. You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies. PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network. Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a guide to the distribution.

"1","(please respond via email!) Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net. The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me). The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors. We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around in the xcms code in Xlib but without some understanding of the theory I have no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the above-mentioned programs work on their systems or let me know if they fail for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have. Any hints? Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

"1","Archive-name: x-faq/part3 Last-modified: 1993/04/04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5? The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup. Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X11. People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch. Here are a few complications: 1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request 5a 5b 5c and 5d separately 2) the file sunGX.uu which was part of an earlier patch was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris] 3) fix 8 is in two parts: 8a and 8b 4) fix 13 is in three parts: 13a 13b and 13c 5) fix 16 is in two parts: 16a and 16b 6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite which previously was optional 7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for PEXlib.uu.[1234]. 8) fix 22 is in 9 parts 22a through 22i ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive? The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response. Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). The xstuff server treats the Subject: header line just like any other line of the message. The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it. 1) The command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file. 2) if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. For example you can say send index fixes (or index fixes). A message that requests an index cannot request data. 3) if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name an item you give its directory and its name. For example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota it sends the requests out shortest-first. 4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses.  If you use such a mailer you won't get any response.  If you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it. The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If your mailer deals in ! notation try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Motif 1.1.2 is also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5? Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5. Motif 1.1 available in source form from OSF as of August 1990 uses the vanilla X11R4 Intrinsics where vanilla means with just a few patches; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18 though. Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5 although there are some known new geometry-management problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK? Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape; the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.

[5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications) The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape. A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93): DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1 MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1 HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5 sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92] User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check that group for posting information. Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely- available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and international sites from which it may be ftp'ed. The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or earlier versions on the X11R3 X11R4 and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu). These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: sirius.ua.oz. The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu which tends to duplicate the export archives is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis at TB+ and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste] A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily (mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution the XTEST distribution an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies. The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K 2400 1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285. A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be: zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies To get a current listing of the files that are available download the file /usrX/ls-lR.Z. A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the file /usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX. The machine has just the one modem so please do not fetch large amounts of data at one sitting. [courtesy Mark Snitily 2/90] In addition UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4 tapes.  It also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  65)! Where can I get interesting widgets? The Free Widget Foundation (FWF) library sponsored by Brian Totty (totty@cs.uiuc.edu) is now [2/93] available on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in pub/fwf-v3.41.shar.Z.

Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt application know when it has been re-exposed resized and when it has received user key and mouse input. The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set -- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler() which loses a number of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality . At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for use. The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  68)  What is the current state of the world in X terminals?

[Kaleb Keithley kaleb@thyme.jpl.nasa.gov 12/91; the file was updated 24 Mar 1993.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  75)  Where can I get an X terminal server for my low-end Sun 3/50? Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current version [1.4 as of 8/91 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu [128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped so it is fairly fast and needs little disk space. A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun like this example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU: #! /bin/sh exec >/dev/console 2>&1 /etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0 case $? in 0)	;; 4)	/etc/reboot -q -n ;; 8)	echo ND fsck failed - get help /etc/halt ;; 12)	echo Interrupted /etc/reboot ;; *)	echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help /etc/halt ;; esac /bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1 /etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp /etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255 /etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11 /etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null set `/etc/ifconfig le0` exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \ `(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)` ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL Simula Prolog Miranda. Also some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well. They also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory and some stuff about comms. The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching. The one critiscism I would level at the course which I would have thought invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months) but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course. Yes I know this sounds like a plug for the course why not! Mackem Ian."

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect) that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window manager does not know about this you cannot move resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root window.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4 20MB of additional essential binaries almost 200MB of Sun patches fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings priced at only $250. Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk set the first containing what's ready and needed now the second available later in '92 containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks. The SUG 1992.1 disk which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside. The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC Macintosh and other workstations as well) and contains a total of 543MB of material including: X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution thus four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias toward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts and are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true but there are statistics.  Furthermore most software engineering at Ford gets done by electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming. But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself."

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case. You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool. You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources. Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() regularly."

What I like about GUI's: - The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects files text directories etc. and and manipulate them in some way such as delete copy paste rename ... - The ability to have several applications / screens visible and accessable at the same time. - Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use. If it has a GUI I can usually accomplish what I want to do fairly easily the command line on the other hand often is a long and painful experience. What I hate about GUI's: - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a computer with one hand and use the other for holding something like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be done with one hand such as navigating cutting pasting searching opening and saving files etc. The main thing I need to use both hands for is entering text. I guess I need to get one of those mice with like 20 buttons or something and then I will have the best of both worlds. Brent"

"1","Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try anyway. I am running xterm and like all UNIX users I run man <something>. Recently I switched to Solaris 2.1 and their man pages are littered with .I directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2 I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining.... So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under .I directives for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling it. (.B directives are fine I like them. And of course I don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) Somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font but not an italic font??

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the way through reading it and it looks like a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. I don't think it's stock MIT but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially. Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock Xterm Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients etc).  If you use more than one then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. Saves screen real estate. 2) mclock suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below. If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z ...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog!  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it. Specifically: How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax. I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway. Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - - Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster. From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw etc) - These take up RAM and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu mouse settings { Mouse Settings:			f.title   Very Fast				! xset m 7 10 &   Normal (Fast)			! xset m 3 10 &   System Default (Un-Accelerated)	! xset m default &   Glacial				! xset m 0 10 & } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out: - For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions corrections or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

"1","Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app-defaults file... check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults depending on how your system is set up. Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. I don't think it's stock MIT but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially. Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock Xterm Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients etc).  If you use more than one then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. Saves screen real estate. 2) mclock suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below. If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z ...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog!  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it. Specifically: How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax. I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway. Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - - Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster. From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw etc) - These take up RAM and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu mouse settings { Mouse Settings:			f.title   Very Fast				! xset m 7 10 &   Normal (Fast)			! xset m 3 10 &   System Default (Un-Accelerated)	! xset m default &   Glacial				! xset m 0 10 & } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out: - For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions corrections or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

"1","Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app-defaults file... check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults depending on how your system is set up. Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif in fact MWM and Motif can work without each other and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface. You cannot say A Porsche looks like a VW K鋐er ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

"1","...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and action-based and the other symbol-based. True but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.) I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all that's what I do too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system. I don't recall the actual stats but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorized as a symbol manipulator. It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers financial analysts structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming and programming is not required to do what they do. To restate my previous point: yes users want to build their own solutions; no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this."

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++ WWL InterViews GINA++ and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned but the resulting code looks little like Motif and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising but I haven't found a free version with Motif support and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task. At this point my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now but in our environment we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve. - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  If money can't buy happiness daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.

My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so.

An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel"

I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is."
"1","Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides.

"1","Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco. The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include: lightweight Objects such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading This by no means captures the complete content of the paper.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel"

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself). Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif. On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available. The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5 since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it? Cheers Tom McConnell -- Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com Intel Corp.

Begging everyone's pardon I was not slamming Motif nor was I necessarily plugging/flaming the two.

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience) and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position I believe is a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards. It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds. Mrs. Henne"

"1","I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens and not multiple X displays.   Given this: - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? What are they; who sells them... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead)? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application.

"1","G'Day Windows NT is a step forward but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system: Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. Object oriented.

Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean: > 	-) multi-screen > 	-) multi-headed > 	-) multi-display > 	-) X-Server zaphod mode As applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms.  multi-headed tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg a Sun with a cg4 display).  multi-screen and multi-display would if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning of multi-display would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers when it's used it probably refers to the same thing multi-screen would: a system that provides multiple Screens. zaphod is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen. > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ? There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth or a border-pixel and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Normally MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become washed out (nearly invisible).

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display 3 2-screen displays 6 1-screen displays or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT this is 3. As released by Megatek this is 12. As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more. -- ---- Rusty Sanders Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or... ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!"
"1","The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on... I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and returns.  The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() { XtAppContext app; Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(); int junk = 0; Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(top); //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents for (int i=0;i<=10;i++) { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(app &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE??? XtUnrealizeWidget(top); XtDestroyWidget(top); XtDestroyApplicationContext(app); XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d Serial number of failed request:  71 Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time) I get: Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice. So finally my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"1","I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine.  BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions but I'm *really* confused. -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown"
"1","Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc. will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0 and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown"
"1","Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it). I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

"1","Hello Motif World a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is."
"1","Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpywidthheight) Display *dpy; int width height; { Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; XSetWindowAttributes attr; fprintf(stderrOpening 8 bit window...\n); if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpyDefaultScreen(dpy)8PseudoColor&vinfo)) { fprintf(stderrYour display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n); exit(1); } fprintf(stderrUsing visual: %x\nvinfo.visual->visualid); cmap = XCreateColormap( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) vinfo.visual AllocNone ); XSync(dpyFalse); XInstallColormap(dpycmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */ attr.colormap = cmap; win = XCreateWindow( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) 1010 widthheight CopyFromParent       /* border width */ 8                    /* depth */ InputOutput          /* class */ vinfo.visual         /* visual */ CWColormap &attr ); return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel"

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself). Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif. On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available. The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5 since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it? Cheers Tom McConnell -- Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com Intel Corp.

Can someone help me? It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem and have given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what keys it will accept and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun from my HP and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not sufficient or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work. However I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work and I do some customised things with them. Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem and I am using exactly the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience) and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position I believe is a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards.

"1","I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens and not multiple X displays.   Given this: - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? What are they; who sells them... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead)? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application.

"1","G'Day Windows NT is a step forward but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system: Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly. In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth or a border-pixel and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display 3 2-screen displays 6 1-screen displays or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT this is 3. As released by Megatek this is 12. As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more. -- ---- Rusty Sanders Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or... ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!"
"1","The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on... I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and returns.  The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() { XtAppContext app; Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(); int junk = 0; Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(top); //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents for (int i=0;i<=10;i++) { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(app &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE??? XtUnrealizeWidget(top); XtDestroyWidget(top); XtDestroyApplicationContext(app); XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d Serial number of failed request:  71 Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time) I get: Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice. So finally my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported but not the hardware?

"1","Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc. will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0 and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown"
"1","Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it). I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

"1","Hi Folks. As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own. In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id how do you change the icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes any difference I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE. Thanks - Scott :)"
"1","Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5 The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation system) did work in R4 but refused to in R5. Of cause the R4-version did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition). Since compiling with R5 the program causes a zero width or height error (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText widgets) exist XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is mapped. The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?"

"1","If you're willing to do a little work you can make DrawnButtons do what you want more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system. We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence. Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You can make things look circular enough. -- Skip (montanaro@crd.ge.com) Why can't X be this easy? -- me after learning about dlopen()"

Anyone have any ideas ?? I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself. To give you a real-world example here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns. But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 10 working programs running you'll know it. Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing) you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...) -- Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!"

"1","(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered) Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped. The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow tickle the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item. What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?"

"1","I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed. Currently to draw interactively I begin with: /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */ /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */ palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red; palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green; palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue; XStoreColors( myDisplay my_cmap &palette_colors[DrawIndex] 1); XFlush( myDisplay); XSetFunction( myDisplay gc GXxor); XSetForeground( myDisplay gc drawIndex); Then to draw I do: XDrawLine( myDisplay XtWindow( drawingArea1) gc x1 y1 x2 y2); XFlush( myDisplay); And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do: XSetFunction( myDisplay gc GXcopy); What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image). Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong? david"

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information then you can use XClearArea to generate an Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the enclosing rectangle of your new item. This is still not great since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn. If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything you'll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the existing scene. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Yang        Silicon Graphics Inc. mikey@sgi.com           415/390-1786"

A pure X application could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.

Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me with XOpenWindow? I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also most of the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls.  From this initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this true?

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after updating the datastructures though... -Rob"

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap. It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications are having to make do with it's colormap. This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap. My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color (if this is an option for the application). - Doug Shaker voice:	415/572-0200 fax:	415/572-1300 email:	dshaker@qualix.com mail:	Qualix Group 1900 S.

If I understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib graphics on the window. It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects you can use XCreateRegion to create a region XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look.

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment came from a simple open-draw-quit client. As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object and then call the window_redraw() (or whatever) directly?  Although depending on how the overall application is structured there may be no problem with rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

"1","I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip). When xlock +nolock is running and I am working remotely or in batch (at) mode the runtime of my programs (as timed by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if xlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my runtimes yet this is very consistent! Any explanations real or imagined :) thanx dale@frostedflakes.llnl.gov"
"1","Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4 Xt Intrisics Programming Manual chapter 3. popup dialog boxes and so on. In example 3.5 page 76 : Creating a pop-up dialog box The application creates window with a button Quit and Press me. The button Press me pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd 4th .... time) it is *much* slower. Has anyone any experience with these sample programs or why I get this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response time from 2nd time onwards ? Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time ? Thankyou - Shirley"

"1","We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use. I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into. Send your comments/wish-list raving et. al. about DevGuide to: Tali.Aben@Sun.COM Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this and computers may have a future. Frankly I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability pointed out in March's SunExpert magazine. Technology works we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is outstanding."

"1","[posted for a friend] Okay I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this but I know its come up before... XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order: Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits) Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match. and when all else fails Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors already allocated in the colormap. This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap and no unallocated cells then XAllocColor fails even when it has already allocated several other cells already and there are dozens of read-only cells already in the colormap. Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part? Any help appreciated Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)"

"1","Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well? My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not?

"1","I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually it seems that this is more of a GCC question because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. Basically there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in let's say CompositeP.h for instance the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget) but in several places in the HP source code they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one as the prototype suggests.  For example: (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w args p_num_args) Now GCC chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.

To incrementally update the contents of windows I use the following trick: 1. Set the window background to None 2. Call XClearArea(display window 0 0 0 0 True) 3. Restore the window background to its correct value. The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window. In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased) I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

X11R5 path level 23.  My X process is started by xdm. i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)! The setup is as follows: lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc tvtwm There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home directory. The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm login window as expected - very nice! Unfortunately when the users session is started the background of the tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an xterm window when the session has started the background is changed as expected. The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the the users session startup? ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters. ie: real key       key shown on screen ------------   ------------------- hash           back slash tilde          pipe double quote   at symbol pound          hash cursor key     not recognised This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and termcap as they seemed more uptodate. Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as expected! Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

Make sure you're using ssetroot which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm starts up it nukes the existing root window.  Use an ssetroot after tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a (sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&) You can also use VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename or just VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey. > ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised >     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating. I would dearly appreciate 1. an explanation of the standard RIGHT CORRECT way to give a window a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it; 2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my desired colormaps. By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this having tried everything reasonable or imaginable. Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this.  Please please please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing wrong/how to do it right!!!

"1","Hello Netlanders: I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod. My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows: 486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4 Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive. I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and inet utilities (tcp/ip). I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly. I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems. However if I try to access the tape drive while in X the machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the tape the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to startx again; the screen changes modes but the grey background pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system. I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem. I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same system.  If you can shed any light on the problem it would be appreciated. One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

"1","According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows e.g. a crosswire cursor for a DrawingArea things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know. The topics on busy cursors in the several FAQ's are not helpful since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Hans Geurtsen                       Phone: (31) (0) 8385 - 33157 Nucletron Research BV.             e-mail: hgn@nuclint.nl Surface: Waardgelder 1 NL-3905 TH  Veenendaal"

"1","Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office. Many thanks for all replies the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. On the PC side I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation. The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at `hostname`:1.0 Some comments on performance I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra 16 MB Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable.

"1","The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be Tek-term) is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus let me know.) The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space it stays an icon. The desired behavior: one of two options - 1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the inactive one. 2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated it should revert to a icon but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher level than the Xterm. What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands would I'd guess need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term. Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif. Thanks for your time.

If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM). xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS. A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT server. I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI by the way) which yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images running on a Sparc IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for animations. Regards Richard Gooch...."

"1","Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. Actually the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct?

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like /**/#This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines that This is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly?

"1","The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs New Mexico State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical Research. The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address is 128.123.1.12 but may change so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever possible). Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research. The Arabic Chinese French Italian Indian Japanese Korean Tibetan and Vietnamese archives will all be moved. We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once the archives have been moved. Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move everything. If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives we have been slowly collecting various software fonts and text for different languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and quantity of multi-lingual tools.

"1","A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program I am writing a library callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called it must initialize things and after that it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function. #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> void bla(XtAppContext app Widget top) { Widget topone = top;		// in real prog these are member vars XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class int junk = 0; Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp NULL NULL NULL NULL 0 &junk NULL); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass topone XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(topone); for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when Exit button clicked { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(theapp &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } XtDestroyWidget(box); XtCloseDisplay(dis); } // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app Widget *top) { int junk = 0; (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); } // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() { static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called static Widget top; static int setup = 0; if (!setup) { SetItUp(&app &top); setup = 1; } bla(app top); } // main - program which links to my library main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) { doit(); printf(sleeping...\n);//widget still on screen at this point sleep(5); } } The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the sleep in the main prog despite the XtDestroyWidget call). Anyone see something I'm missing? Thanks very much.

"1","I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out? How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry. In ORA Vol. 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to Vol. 4 it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For example the translation: Shift<Key>q:	quit() will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key (and the q key). This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do what I want but it doesn't it doesn't work if the user presses the control key the shift key and the o key. Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use XtInstallAccelerators().

"1","I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

"1","store and reply of mouse and keyboard events -------------------------------------------- To produce regression tests or automatic demo's we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user. It should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue an to store them in a file. This sequence of events stored in a file should be given to the server's queue as if a user is working. 1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all mouse and keyboard events (where)? 2. Where one can catch these events to store them ? In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP). Where can we catch all events coming from a given server. If this is not possible can we catch all events given to a certain client and how ? 3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ? Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ? Thanks in advance Ron."

Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using. Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps? These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much cheaper. Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running in XSynchonize mode. -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland"

"1","[again poseted for a friend] Okay I got such great response from my last question (thanks everyone) lets try again: How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only? I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color. Once I determine if a cell is read-only I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application. So far the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly... Any ideas? Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)"

A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is something that should be avoided. Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too?

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following platforms: SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) IBM (AIX 3.2) Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1 and GCC). DEC Ultrix. DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1). Documentation is available online. Changes since 0.13 include: o Added new resource gethostbynameIsEvil for Sun's that coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view window is closed for window managers too dull to do so themselves. o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. o Added 'Clear' button to Open box to allow more convenient cut-n-paste entries of URL's. o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False new document view windows will not be automatically positioned by the program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how they're placed). o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not right for authors and readers can't do anything about bad images in any case). o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy dana@thumper.bellcore.com). o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy bingle@cs.purdue.edu). o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some documentation.

Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it. This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later. Currently my solution is: XCreateWindow(...); XSetWMProperties(..); XMapWindow(...); XFlush(...); XMoveWindow(...); It works with olwm but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering if I'm overlooking something obvious. Richard."

"1","A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm) he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font. The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option) no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables. Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas? More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe) with the most current operating system and running X11R5. It is not mwm's fault as the same problems occur under twm etc."

"1","Hello I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent a unix clone OS for Intel architecture machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program). The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character and so on.  It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters. If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where I should look to find it it would be much appreciated.

Can anybody help me out? The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case: Ctrl Any<Key>q. >In ORA Vol. 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

For >example the translation: >	Shift<Key>q:	quit() >will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as >the Shift key (and the q key). This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations. >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? If you mean menu accelerator no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page. >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >can't use XtInstallAccelerators(). I can't think of a reason why not. >How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of >case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one >menu entry. There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget] set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell shell). For example applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade -- filePulldown - openPushbutton - exitPushbutton *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\ Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton ArmAndActivate)\n\ Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton ArmAndActivate) You have to write and add the application action PerformAction which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments. I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me but the more general approach I described above should work. -- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)"

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However I may have colormap questions later.....

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution. Actually I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side they were just about equal. The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps). Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?) and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs) so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one). In short: allowing all three forms of display within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network) and let the user pick whatever feels fastest. (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :) )Rob"

"1","I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough I have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning. In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles here's a crude picture: ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== | |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+ |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C + |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+ |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C but + |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  + |    +      window window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     + |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+ | ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need since I also insist on having a virtual WM. The only problem is that the title location is static that is  it is configured in .twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore I have implemented f.squeeze{ left center right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this: +---------+ + title A + +------------------------+ +   this is the          + +     body of the        + +      window window A  + +------------------------+ to this: +---------+ + title A + +------------------------+ +   this is the          + +     body of the        + +      window window A  + +------------------------+ =============== Okay. So far so good. Now how the heck do I get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of? One way would be to post in comp.windows.x a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing and hope that someone reads it. :-) In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing look back up at Figure 1 and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter the result is: +=========+   +---------+   +=========+ + title B +   + title A +   + title C + +-------------------------------------+ +   this is the body of the window   + +   window A which is on top.        + +-------------------------------------+ =================== The rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long. The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c: #ifdef SHAPE case F_SQUEEZELEFT: {	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT 0 0 }; if (DeferExecution (context func Scr->SelectCursor)) return TRUE; tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; SetFrameShape( tmp_win ); break; } .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif ( Of course you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h and add { f.squeezeleft FKEYWORD F_SQUEEZELEFT } ... and so forth ... to parse.c In order to use these functions add something like the following to your .twmrc file: Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter ================= About a year ago I posted this but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out. Since then blast has appeared in comp.sources.x Volume 19 Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

"1","| | Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu | Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some | documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server- | resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code | mentioned above... There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!). I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write) If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device. One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them. One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that in its sample implementation there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden violent death (e.g. kill).  You have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments. Ken -- Kenneth Whaley			 (408) 748-6347 Kubota Pacific Computer Inc.

"1","Hi Xperts! I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition. previously i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that  the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded. I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi 75dpi and misc. when i run xinit the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space. Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows  to just have my x-windows running. Thanks Pramod --"

First I create the shared memory segment attach the client attach the X server and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment only dies after all attachments are gone. Now if the client dies that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you) and since the X server notices the client has dies frees up it's resources including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment.

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have already written I am sure) and would therefore be probably be a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class. Is this more difficult (in principle not lines of code)? I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists  but you might consider this as an alternative. Alternatively if anyone has a multi-column list widget they could sell me this might save me from having to write one! Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not yet have the spec)? Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD widget sets  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port. -- Douglas S.

"1","I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me. I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer and since I don't have much experience with programming X I thought this issue might be helpful as it has a section on debugging and a section on the 40 most common errors in programming X. At the end of the errors section there are the following references for tutorials on X programming style.  They are: Rosenthal David -   A simple X11 client program Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference 1988. Lemke D. and Rosenthal D. -  Visualizing X11 clients Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference 1989. Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably) electronic form?

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around etc.  But for most work the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.) I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced. All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). -- \---------------------------------------------------------------------/ \ Seth Buffington 	U.S.S.

"1","I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like /**/#This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines that This is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly?

Can someone help me? Unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example the sequence ESC [ 1 B 7 would indicate that the HOME key was pressed with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such as shift-Return. If anybody wants these changes they're welcome to them but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file x11term.c.  Maybe if someone at OSF is interested I can send them the tweaks but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest I'll post the mods somewhere although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it. Notes: * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual. * The patches I made were to version 18.58 under Sun OS 4.1.2 [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.] Two ways: 1) When you start the xterm you can use command line options: -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly: The basic escape sequence is: ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2' '1' or '0' depending on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title or both and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string. Hence this command will set the window & icon title: echo \033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c To set just the icon title: echo \033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c To set just the window title: echo \033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c Of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax depending on how the echo command works on your system and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics under Bourne or Korn shells). [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string instead of using convenient octal sequences.] If you want your titlebar updated continously say to show your current directory hostname or somesuch then you'll have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage() what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff. To speak about POVRay the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good especially in speed protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance.

Thanks for this clue and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the same direction. One solution due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up we SetValue its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem.) The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows: 1) Use twm or mwm rather than olwm 2) Use olwm with resource *wmTimeout: 10 3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed. This is obviously working around some bug somewhere. Thanks -- Chris Ho-Stuart"
"1","I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently although I will also be working with Open Look in the future. What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say for example that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A. From the research and testing I've done so far it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch. The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice. Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup. Cheers....

"1","Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget. Unfortunately I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines and things of that sort?  Or barring that a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself? Any and all help would be very appreciated. Many thanks ---Mark =============================================================================== Mark A. DeLoura       deloura@cs.unc.edu      U of North Carolina Chapel Hill"

But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ | window of my application I get my colormap. I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell and so it won't allow cmap focus either. Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path. (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit you can set cmap focus explicit also but you then need a binding to f.focus_color probably on MB1). -- David Brooks					dbrooks@osf.org Open Software Foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote"

Now I'm bewildered by the huge number of standards that open systems has created. I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools here were produced with the Athena Widget set or X Intrinsics or Xw (??). In my humble opinion they look like crap.  I don't know however if this is a characteristic of the tookits or just poor aestetic taste in the programmers. I would like my app to look a little more sculptured like mwm.  I understand however that mwm isn't free like the other tookits. I am getting Linux so I will have InterViews but I don't know how it will look.

Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1 X11R5 Server Hardware:	Sun IPC Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1 Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37) A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun DecWindows Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users. I have tried the following things: 1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch (100444-37). 2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm. 3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110). This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method) and screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help but I was still able to get the application to hang. Repeat By: This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times. Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up) Click and release on a menu item Repeat until application hangs Any help would be appreciated.

I tried it without the pipe by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud and got the same error from xwud.

"1","Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools but they are 1) heavy 2) hard to find when you need one 3) limited in their software expandibility 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis 5) cannot be remotely operated and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS requiring much manual manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump but we found it 1) too difficult for most people 2) did not have enough information for many protocols 3) could not be used interactively 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features. Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better. The following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional processing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1 New features: Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r' the file type will be automatically detected. Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file. The hex format has been changed. New time options have been added. Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets. Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag) New flags: -R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed except for reading from stdin -ttt	prints delta times -tttt	prints times relative to the first frame -W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

"1","We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi. Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese' each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1 jisx0208 or so. We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is. We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'. //I18N.h // This may look like C code but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.hv 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $ #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H #include <X11/Xlib.h> extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str	/* IN */ int wc_len		/* IN */ char *buf		/* OUT */ int *buflen		/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len	/* OUT */ char **charset);	/* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc); #endif /* _I18N_H */ //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.ccv 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include I18N.h extern C { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include Xlocaleint.h #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale const wchar_t* int char* int* int* int*); extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale _CSID); extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale _CSID); }; int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str/* IN */ int wc_len		/* IN */ char *buf		/* OUT */ int *buf_len		/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len	/* OUT */ char **charset)	/* OUT */ { XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert(); int ctid; int status; Charset *xcharset; status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale wc_str wc_len buf buf_len scanned_len &ctid); if (status == Success) { xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale ctid)); *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL; } else *charset = NULL; return status; } ---------------- An included file above Xlocaleint.h is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled. A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01. When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing: _Xmbctidtocsid (code) _Xmbfscs (code) _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code) _XFallBackConvert (code) We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used its internal functions. The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution. My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5. In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. Any help or comments would be highly appreciated. I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.

As I've said before there's no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented you can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several layers of windows.

This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have to say? With regard to dialup X11 implementations there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies including both GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.) NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such software packages available. X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX) and is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various sorts of hardware.

"1","Hi Xperts this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)... I'm using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by PANEL_MAX_VALUE! As I understand PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items doesn't work in the case of slider despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: /* Panel_multiline_text_item Panel_numeric_text_item * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */ PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM			 152) PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT		 182) which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute and returns value 0. Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields but not Sun's Xview... Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me and clear this problem? Any help is very much appreciated. Yuri yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy"
"1","I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The hardware is truecolor in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X clients.  The three problems I see are: 1) The colormap though huge is static. 2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide. 3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error. Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask: will these limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of e.g. 8 bits but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary. I know there are no absolutes but I'd appreciate hearing people's opinions and suggestions.  Thanks! -- Frederick G. M.

Bounding rectangle operations are sufficient for object selection.

I wanted to get some measurement of response time so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window maps it and sends the first Expose event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event to receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program. Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program available from ftp.uu.net which bombards the server with graphics operations but I just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is acceptable interactive response time.

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor. The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got picked up by the child.

"1","We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully started we run an xterm as the console - the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  Refresh window fails to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them. At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1. We're running X in color and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the B/W framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted. My question is: has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages? Please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk. Hugh McIntyre. INMOS Ltd. Bristol UK.

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were: 1) Clients written with logic like the following: if (DefaultDepth() != 1) /* Assume default depth is 8bit */ These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window to run correctly. 2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much and just outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class with a dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes but many clients don't bother to check they just start throwing XStoreColor calls at you. Though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland"

I used to think this way and not just about X. For example incorrect English constructs such as its raining or it's window id annoy me. However there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!). On a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour - being Irish and hence using English English as opposed to American English I always use the latter except of course for API terms such as XAllocColor and colormap. In a world that uses the term Windows to refer to Microsoft Windows perhaps the time has come to accept X Windows as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say the X Window System and let's face it almost everyone uses it. Ultimately we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect product recognition is important and a short snappy descriptive title (X is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called Microsoft Windows or the Microsoft Window System or how about just plain Microsoft! To summarise (or should that be summarize) the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be windowing system). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. Gerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk) Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd."

Well yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate but I do think it's worth pointing out that popular usage is not always sufficient excuse. In this case for example I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably not. The same is true of X.  The X Window System X X11 and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  In fact some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point. As for the trade publications that promulgate things like X Window or X.windows or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong? Popular usage is as it may be but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness. >Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS >was really down to popular opinion (I know we all think it's(!) technically >superior as well!). X11 technically superior to NeWS?  Well in *some* alternate universe perhaps ..."

A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting though only Consortium members will be able to vote. This year's theme is Application Construction by Non-Programmers Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have however been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as What is needed for application construction by non-programmers? Can we avoid programming altogether or is a simple language needed? Is it sufficient to create applications or must users be able to create new widgets? Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves? Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System including applications experience with users new objects reviews of and proposals for revision of internal Andrew protocols We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration. Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June. Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

Archie provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp sites by examining directories returned as query matches and allows you to retrieve files located this way. Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4 R5 and a variety of other flavors of X and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows: * Major improvements include: - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new features (FWF MultiList widget). - Ability to expand directories in browser. - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation. - Ability to save and reload query results as well as print them. - Ability to resort results and sort results by user-definable pseudo-weights. - Online help browser. - Color resources done so that they don't break mono displays. - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations. - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Enjoy! Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is. 8< - 8< - Hello Motif World over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved a few defaults have been changed and a lot of other small things have been added. This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x. Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours) and delete all previous copies. Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT: HISTORY The University of Lowell supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation has developed a wrapper-library that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell. I Ronald van Loon at a certain point last year have taken the Lowell bindings fixing the bugs I came across adding missing memberfunctions and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC). NEW RELEASE I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings. This release offers: - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset - Two additional widgets written by myself that can be used to indicate progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake and its config files on your site. I have tried to provide the bindings with a standard Makefile tweakable for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif X and C++ previously posted on Usenet. WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS Ftp: Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) directory /pub/X11. Note: Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours. Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings. E-mail: Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail and I will send the bindings by e-mail. REQUEST Those who use the bindings and find bugs or see room for improvement please contact me and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs a bug-fix of course ;-).

I'd like to take the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message server and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it since the Sun-supplied textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk. However the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For example the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a dropsite in the main control area while the source in contrib/xview knows nothing about drag and drop. The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50 dated 5/22/90 while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says: textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro So does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?

It seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.

Specifically it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1 and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). Currently the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface such as the SPARCstation2. Xavier has been tested in the following environments: SUN: Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1 NEC(EWS): Machine : EWS4800/210230 OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1Release5.2 C++     : C++ Release3.1 It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/ (Xavier.large-demo.tar and Xavier.tar) We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier. If you are interested please contact xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. I will add your e-mail address to our list.

"1","I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps. The X11R5 documentation says: Usually a window manager creates these colormaps.  I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps. Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps. However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black. So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps. Finally the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation XmuStandardColormap and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation. According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436): For GrayScale colormaps only the colormap red_max red_mult and base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored. To compute a GrayScale pixel value use the following expression: (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF XmuGetColormapAllocation defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c is used by XmuLookupStandardColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c to select red_max green_max and blue_max values for the call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the total number of cells in the gray scale sets green_max to 59% of the total number and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number. Referring to section 14.3 one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale. When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified XmuStandardColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c sets red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3 one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored. When red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal 1 XmuCreateColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c constructs a gray map. The sum of red_max green_max and blue_max gives the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3 on would expect red_max to give the maximum gray value."

Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority. The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup.

Perhaps > if every application used standard colormaps things would > be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use > standard colormaps. Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT. I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5). If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer. Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland"

"1","I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat commonplace so I'm sending a net-feeler. I have a display that is a non-interlaced memory mapped 1-bit 720x280 display.  The server's view of the world (obtained via xwd | xwud) seems to be exactly what it should be.  However the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes which isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- to: --- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display) or to pad only to byte boundries? I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2 under Mach 3.0. Thanks Brian"
"1","These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions. 1.  If my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt all O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent() I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier requirements. 2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord and their right/left sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the xy coord of the window manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget() immediately checking the xy after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border. Any help would be most appreciated. Darcy darcy_mccallum@mentorg.com"
"1","I have the following problem on X11R5 servers. When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored. Normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window no expose event is sent. When ExposureMask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws. Everything works fine with X11R4. Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)? Is it something I do wrong? Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)? Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

"1","We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e. the w of (w client call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some instances but bogus in other instances. We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23 patches (with the MotifBC flag set) we recompiled Motif and then we recompiled the application. Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should have used?  Should we have left Motif alone? Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

"1","Hi there (I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response so I'm posting here.) I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720). It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets.  However this digitiser makes use of the serial port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver. The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number). I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I? What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a specific X application)?  If so what were the steps required for installation? Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"1","I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core  and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.

With Imake-TeX you will never again have to fiddle around with calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex bibtex). Simply type make and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date.

"1","Hi ppl I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. I have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11 so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr. My first impression was very good I was able to get Z and Y straight :) There's still a little problem I can't solve however: I cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets. The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work. I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry Mode_switch which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift but what is the 3rd?? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't. If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them help would be appreciated. CU Alaric"

So I doesn't returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe. I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may be able to clarify. 1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !! Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes.

"1","Hi I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to fork GDB off as a subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program the following happens : PROGRAM : main() { int x; printf(enter x : ); scanf(%d &x); printf(x = .%d.\n x ); } OUTPUT : The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type in a value (like 5) then all the printf's output comes out at one time. Is there any other way besides using PIPES to do this i.e. like ioctl or something else ??

"1","Hello X'ers I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes.

On the client side I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request. As far as I can tell from the manual the only attribute which may give a BadMatch is the colormap if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the visual was correctly matched as I did not get the error message. What am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error.

The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the MenuButton section of the Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface documentation states bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label. One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap resource but remember that you or a user of your application won't be able to set it from a resource file.

First at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand how to deliver the magic cookie and won't run on a display with authorization turned on. Second we have people with client software on remote machines and I really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support Xauthorization. So what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization. (Yes I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals but non-privileged users can't do this.) I've checked with the HP Support Line and there doesn't appear to be a way. Can anyone confirm this or do you know of a way to accomplish what I want? BTW I'm running HPUX 9.0 and Vue 3.0.

Most generic unix software works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips.

I know of several such programs idraw xfig. tgif. I have no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles arcs straight lines boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential but in fact very handy: preservation of connection. If I move one part of the drawing the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing stay connected. Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics flow charts logic diagrams data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it.

To accomodate AIX version 3.2 we have created a patch to the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch.  For those without internet access a 3.5 diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending or faxing a purchase order to the address below. The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host. Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2. ----------- The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create use and mail multi-media applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts indentation and other typography but also  contains embedded raster images spreadsheets drawing editors equations simple animations and so on. These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects including text. AUIS has three components: The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set of applications beginning with the ez text editor a help system a system monitoring tool an editor-based shell interface and other editors corresponding to the various available types of objects. The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable object-oriented user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that come with the system. The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail management strategies and implements many advanced  features including authentication return receipts automatic sorting of mail vote collection and tabulation enclosures audit trails of related messages and subscription management. It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function personal computers in addition to high-function workstations. The current public release of Andrew Version 5.1  includes support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart multimedia mail.  A newer release 5.2 for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings images fonts and user preferences. Remote Andrew Demo Service You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups. To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service simply run the following command on your machine: finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu The service will give you further instructions.

"1","REPOST: I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

"1","One way to mask the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case it is the show_mouse_position function. If the XEvent arrive in this function as XEvent p_event; then the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. By the way you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button.

"1","I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif but I'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about this problem........ - I am using an XmTextField and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString. The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed the text is getting truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english everything works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns. (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual application just in my sample code to make things easier) - I am running Motif 1.2 X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts. - Don't know if this matters but my dialog box and TextField is initially created with UIL. The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. Please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program. THANKS!!!!!!!! - Susan swalker@bbn.com 617-873-8190"

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the X protocol and a bug in the Xt intrinsics. The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (xy) position given in ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. At this point the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date. If a SetValues is done using the same (xy) position the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there.  However a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same.) The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (xy) positioning information in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in gorier details. s'marks -- Stuart W. Marks				stuart.marks@eng.sun.com Window Systems Technology		2550 Garcia Ave. M/S 21-228 SunSoft Inc.

Even more when I realise how much a burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better than I like C++. But sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments that come close to NeXTSTEP the appkit etc. Also environs that support rapid prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want to do real work. Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews (what it is exactly I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I started with NeXTSTEP.)

"1","At the moment I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3 and OpenWindows 2.0. This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For example when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2 display I can't open the compose window. I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start the X programs. Is there a ready to go binairy of the X11 server for my configuration (I have read something about Xsun) or must I compile the X11 stuff by myself? Any help is welcome V.

"1","Hello I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2 X11R5 Motif and xdt3. I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X. I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T' but that doesn't work. xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc and not to the call to X. The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact it tells me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file. So far the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc. I would rather not do it this way.

"1","> It is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had. Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of changes that the GNU COPYLEFT is protecting us. Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide- shows because of its -loop feature that display does not have (display from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D) but I think I will implement it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

"1","I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap. I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap. Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values or is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap but couldn't get that to work either. Any help would be appreciated. -------------------------------------- Don Lemoine Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division Dahlgren VA 22405 (703)663-7917 dlemoin@xobu.nswc.navy.mil"

(Arrghhh!!)  ]] With renewed interest in setting the DISPLAY variable etc.. I thought I would post my contribution. This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent about what it's doing so that you should be able to type rx host.domain.etc and get a xterm running on host.domain.etc with all the difficult stuff taken care of. In theory this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it doesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a rx big-machine make for instance for a backgrounded make on the remote big-machine. For more details and a full list of features read the README file about 20 lines below...

Version 3.1.7 X XCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk> X XTrivial to install but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial. X XThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed just Xedit the rx.pl file and read the comments.  Once you've done Xthis you can xmkmf then make install install.man. X XFEATURES: X X*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  Including X   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names and passing X   magic cookies or doing the xhost stuff. X X*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...) X X*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy. X X*) Custom command execution - link it to remacs to get a remote X   emacs command. X X*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname X   and turns on login shell. X X*) Default command is xterm. X X*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user may X   extend the list of variables to pass. X X*) Special handling for bourne shell users. X X*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local. X   That is it propagates $PWD in an intelligent manner. X X*) Logs errors in a file. X X*) Overall Intelligence (TM) - makes reasoned decisions about what X   you are trying to do and tries to do the right thing. X X*) Written in Perl for portability and hackability.

X] X.SH DESCRIPTION XThe X.B rx Xprogram connect to the specified X.I host Xand executes the specified X.I command Xin the background returning immediately.  To allow the execution Xof X programs it copies a number of environmental variables to Xthe remote session.  If you omit X.IR command  Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The X.B rxterm Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host and also passes X.I args Xto the remote xterm as arguments. X.PP XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local Xmachine while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote Xmachine. X.PP XIf the name of the file from which X.B rx Xis executed is anything other than ``rx'' X.B rx Xtakes this name stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command Xto run on the remote host using any X.I command Xparameters as arguments for the remote command. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xthinks you are using X.B xauth Xbased X authorisation and you are calling to a off-site host or Xto a different username it will attempt to copy an authorization Xkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use X.B xhost(1) Xto grant access to the remote host. X.SH OPTIONS X.TP X.BI \-l  username XUse X.I username Xas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence Xof this option the remote username is the same as your local username. X X.SH ENVIRONMENT XIf set the values of PATH DISPLAY XENVIRONMENT XAPPLRESDIR XXFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH OPENWINHOME LD_LIBRARY_PATH Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program unless the Xremote username is different or the remote host is off-site in which Xcase only DISPLAY is exported with in all cases any variables named in the Xvariable RXENV. X.PP XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate to contain as qualified Xa hostname as is needed. X.SH DIAGNOSTICS X.TP X.IB command : don't recognise my name. X.B rx Xcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case Xit prints a warning message and continues as normal. X.TP X.B rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...] XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.

X.SH SEE ALSO XX(1) rsh(1) xterm(1) xauth(1) xhost(1) gwm(1) X.SH BUGS X.B Rx Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the Xlocal user and the remote one depending on whether the remote Xhost is onsite or not and whether an alternative username was used Xor not. X.PP XIn particular if either the locally used shell or the remotely Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell X.B sh(1) Xthen strange things are more likely to happen.  Especially when Xit's only one of them. X.PP XSometimes quoting can get messed up. X.PP XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in X.B rx Xto make it believe something that is not true and fail because of it. X.PP XWhen X.B rx Xuses X.B xhost Xto grant access the X.B xhost Xcommand may fail silently. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine it will Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh.  If this happens you Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

X# X# Distribution limited as per the usual MIT copyright. X############################################################################## X# remote execution of X programs.  Based on a script in an old version of gwm. X# X# To install put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it. X#  Some configuration will be necessary see CONFIG comments... X# X# More and more this is less and less like the original.... X# X# Major hacked to work for our(my) set up and also partly X#  re-written to work with sh rather than ksh. X# X# Maybe I'll turn this into our first zsh script! X# X# Looks like it turned into a perl script at some point - big improvement. X############################################################################## X# This code tries to be intelligent in the way it works.  This means there X#  are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in. X#  These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use and in my X#  environment.  At the same time I try to make as few assumptions as possible X#  about the remote machine.  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones... X# *) That the remote machine has csh.  (Linux?) X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh.  (Make same.) X# *) If remote shell = sh that $PATH is compatible.  (Use csh etc..) X# *) I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be but does it X#    know what to do with a cookie. (eat it?) X# *) There must be others... X############################################################################## X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands?  Simply because it doesn't X#  interact badly with rsh and hang waiting for a file descriptor to X#  be closed.  I'd rather use zsh or bash or even perl but they are not X#  as universal as csh.

The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far it would be best to run as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11 window manager xterm etc.) and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal (where n ranges from 4 to 10 depending on who I talk to). What should I be looking for?  What sort of questions should I be asking the salespeople? Thanks Trevor J. Smedley - smedley@tuns.ca School of Computer Science Technical University of Nova Scotia"

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString. You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses as you like.

The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8 of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions) where there is about 10 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons. The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in Volume One  chapter 9.

"1","We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X X-designer Tele-Use tcl/tkInterviews and SUIT. So far I've drawn the following conclusions: 1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ? 10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.

"1","Hi I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment variables (like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc) in my .login file.  With xdm the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. I used the DisplayManager._0.userPath resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession but that didn't help.  I also tried using DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH which didn't work either.

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group I'll take the liberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to support@qdeck.com. A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like Smoking Clover would make the link useless for anyone else.  On the other hand probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes. Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis I wouldn't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people. >>Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding >>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of >>thing) you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before >>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). > >Hmmm.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server.  As I warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link. Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. If no backing store then what was being covered up?  If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls. > > >>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >>doing network things also...) >>-- > >What do you mean by network things?

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's pretty good for this.  X programs are best DOS text programs are almost as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid. We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell us. +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   | |         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\  | |  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\  | |   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\  | |          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\  | |    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\  | |     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\  | |         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+"

In the list you mentioned tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively it allows any font sizes but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing. Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told that it compiles under Linux but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with both color and monochrome X. -- Bill Cheng // UCLA Computer Science Department // (310) 645-8328 3564-C Boelter Hall // Los Angeles California 90024 // USA william@CS.UCLA.EDU      ...!{uunet|ucbvax}!cs.ucla.edu!william"
"1","Greetings We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image effectively turning them into xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays. When we had 3 xkernel machines things worked fine but when we installed 4 more last weekend we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2 the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged. Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the department chair it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server). Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? How about obvious gimmes? And of course any ideas on how to solve it? Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Greg Owen  { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu gowen@jade.tufts.edu } Systems Programmer and TA Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file instead of your login-only one which is fair enough if you only have a few users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do what the books tell them though then it's confusing at best.  Another is to have your xterms run login shells but that still leaves the window manager and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment. Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell and has *it* then run the rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set up as normal and inherited by everything.

In X10 the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests;  that is the server's drawing model was stateless. This caused problems with performance and network traffic so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization then pass the GC id in each drawing request. For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics."

Why did X designers decide to not associate |> the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the |> display it is being drawn on? For flexibility. Anyway what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext not with a display and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2 you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpywingc_redx1y1x2y2); XDrawLine(dpywingc_bluex3y3x4y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every drawing call so why do it for color ? BTW stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points) for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing where you pay some nominal fee get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets especially if you only one customer to distribute to.

"1","Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists --------------------------------------------- Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for SCO products in general. With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO newsgroups many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.* hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide. biz.sco.{opendesktopgeneralannounce} were newgrouped May 1 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within biz.  Given the content this change relocated the opendesktop newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new announce and general groups.  On Aug 1 1991 the former sco-list@uunet.uu.net became scogen in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions. biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1 1992 to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix UNIX and OpenDesktop specific binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are moderated with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups. Respecting USENET etiquite these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts. biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14 1992 to provide a discussion area for the readers writers and publishers of SCO Magazine. Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed you are now able to subscribe to the following: Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription ---------                    ------------------------- biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.sources			<none> biz.sco.binaries		<none> biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP as do many archive sites. If after having explored all options you are still unable to receive biz.sco.* as news you may subscribe to the mailing lists. The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email. Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate mailing list subscription address above including in the message body: Add: subscriber_address		-eg- Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or- Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled the same way simply substitute Delete: for Add: ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list subscribers receive how to post to the mlist article submission information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive an acknowledgement within a few days check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases it's likely that someone somewhere is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do the same with mailing list traffic) and you'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list subscriptions are free subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site(s) feeding you. Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site. What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable): biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past present and future implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating environment and it's various bundled components. biz.sco.general:     Questions answers and comments on SCO products in general and of course resulting discussions. biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of interest to current and future users of SCO products and to SCO developers resellers and distributors. (moderated followups directed to biz.sco.general). biz.sco.sources:	SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and utilities modified to compile and run with various incarnations of SCO Xenix UNIX and/or OpenDesktop. biz.sco.binaries:	Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source code often from source posted in biz.sco.sources and often installable using the SCO custom utility. biz.sco.magazine:	Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers writers and publishers. You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup.  For example posting your ODT question to the general newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public ODT archives.  Appropriate crossposting is allowed.

"1","We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. We typically have several of these running in windows plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o. Any suggestions or examples most welcome! We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems. Morris Hirsch aka morris@sg25.nusc.navy.mil or 401 841 7800"

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get to the root window.  Now this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window so be sure to take that into account for further calculations. Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION. Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window so the windows xywidthheight must be adjusted accordingly. All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using. Now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly). DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory and I no longer have the code.  But I did get it working under several window managers correctly.

"1","I have been using a HDS X-terminal and really like it. What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window manager. One can then run a special client X program called a window manager either (1) run motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc or vms). This is powerful especially since I can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other). Well the question is: On a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program?

"1","I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. However this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. After some research I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family Weight Slant and Pointsize.  I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts but not for the family I am using (Helvetica). I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font). The command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a resolution X appears to pick a stupid default. Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so why?  Is there anything I can do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about my resolution and specify a single font path (75 or 100 not both). This would at least make my app consistent but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: Yup thats an inch.  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

So use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!). And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets setting the visual and colormap resources rather than direct X routines so I could be wrong. But I think this is the general difficulty.

"1","Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice I would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course this would be circumventing the author's wishes on the subject but I'd say if you're not going to pay him no matter what you'd be on relatively safe ground with that approach...  In fact given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being a lawyer I can't be positive. Regardless the fees he's asking are not excessive and I would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing else. - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  If money can't buy happiness daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.

Special Notes: * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4 due to ship later this year. * Yes Sun is moving to Motif along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to which they move will be a new Motif with some of the OPEN LOOK UI features added. * Yes OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead. This means TNT is dead too. * XView and OLIT will be supported but probably not enhanced after the next release.  I don't know if there will be a source release of XView 3.1 or not. * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool at least. * Yes the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant. Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly.

Subject: Bibliography -- books manuals journals papers beer-mats Subject: Getting this File Revision History Recent Changes Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK OpenWindows X11 XView OLIT MOOLIT Motif @ What is OPEN LOOK? OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of windows buttons and scroll-bars how you resize things how you edit files etc. The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?). See Also: Bibliography @ What is OpenWindows? OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems. It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors. OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively. It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook' as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else. A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5000 for the server plus about $25000 for DeskSet and another $40000 for ToolTalk. The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1 See Also: Mixing X11 and OpenWindows Where can I get it? @ What are OLIT XView and TNT? These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary: OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system; it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a division of AT&T now owned by Novell) who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.). Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses. [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference] XView is Sun's toolkit for X11 written in C.  XView is similar in programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows. The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere). The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0. Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be included in the next release of OpenWindows unlike NeWS. On the other hand the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as OLIT. The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows. The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0 but Sun are committed to supporting the API at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail. You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing. Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT however. The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++ class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3 and presumably V3.0.1 since the release mentions that it works on Solaris 2. UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!). @ Where does Motif fit in? It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non- commercial Motif toolkits available although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a large installed base. Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable. @ What is MoOLIT? MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V Release 4.2. Contact: Joanne Newbauer jo@usl.com (908) 522-6677 @ What about that Display PostScript thing? Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use as I understand it.  The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller being generally less complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine. Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work; what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen. Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems the DPS extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard. (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available however) Subject: Window Managers -- olwm olvwm @ What are olwm and olvwm? They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen and for managing the user's interaction with the windows. Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager. It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations and you can also get the source by ftp since Sun donated it. Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it. Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib directory; there are three patches). @ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm? Yes.  If you use twm for example or mwm you won't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm and you (probably) won't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages. If you use twm you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run under olwm. For twm put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: LeftTitleButton target = f.delete where target is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. Alternatively try # Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton :menu = f.menu OL.menu menu OL.menu { Quit         f.delete } For mwm you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told). See the manual page for your window manager (twm etc). Subject: OpenWindows Terminals and Other Displays @ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal? The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView NeWS (PostScript) and X11. This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems. Unfortunately it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes pageview in particular. You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open- Windows display and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones) will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found.  If so see the Fonts section below. If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal you may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help. Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows @ What configuration files do I need to know about? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc The first time you run OpenWindows a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files. If your site uses xdm you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file. .openwin-init .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an X terminal you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C shelltool -C xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's contool program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen. Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc. .Xdefaults You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular it is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true *Input: TRUE These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. Props the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into .Xdefaults. Don't put comments in .Xdefaults since `props' deletes them. .startup.ps This is the NeWS user profile file read by OpenWindows (actually xnews) on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual near the back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient. WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3. Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see the man page for xset (man xset and xset -help) for more information. Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second (300000 microseconds) and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn't include the time to process each key which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again this is for OpenWindows 3... % don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual % /IncludeDemos? false def UserProfile begin /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly... end You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory like this: /NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage If you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the OpenWindows server like this: $ psh -i .startup.ps Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 /classinit ClassRepeatKeys send %%% now press control-D You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make the root window be retained so that a PostScript drawing on the background won't be erased when you move windows: frambuffer /Retained true put will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically. See also: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults? Environment Variables @ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard? You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises.  See also man 7 xview for a list of keybindings you can change at least for XView programs. With OpenWindows 2.0 you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this in your .xinitrc: if eval `svenv -env` then xmodmap -e pointer = 1 2 3 input_from_defaults else xmodmap -e pointer = 3 2 1 fi @ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle? Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'. Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system as it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system run screenblank automatically. Subject: Key Bindings Cut and Paste @ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs? To go from XTerm to textedit (say): * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button in xterm * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6 or Meta+c (the O'Reilly XView manual gets this wrong) * Move to the textedit window and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v) If this doesn't work see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste To go the other way from textedit to XTerm: * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button). * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons. @ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available? Quick Copy within textedit mailtool etc: * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined or crossed out as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey) * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button. * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret. Drag and Drop to Move a Selection * Select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple- clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon). * Still holding SELECT down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target to show that it's OK to drop things here * Let go of SELECT and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows. Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection except that you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button. @ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere? See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them. In general the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the right of the insert point. Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward) Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page. @ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented? See the manual page for shelltool. Subject: Applications: Finding Out... Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide which lists over 200 pages of applications and also the _huge_ Catalyst listing of products for Suns updated six-monthly. Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo and receive the full product documentation. SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users Printer's Pallate which contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters as well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license. There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a copy including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a faster reply. Subject: DeskSet Mailtool Calendar Manager etc. @ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)? Yes cm_delete cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages. If man cm_delete doesn't work or gives strange messages see under Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages below. @ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail? The best way is: $ cd $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc . $ chmod +w .textswrc edit .textswrc (use vi textedit or whatever you prefer) add the follwing: KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER cat ~/.signature (you might need to change ~ to $HOME) Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file. Subject: Fonts @ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts? Yes under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which). Or Not Yet in other words. If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them I'm told. The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted though and comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the Sun OpenFonts group listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts. You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS Monotype Linotype URW and probably other major foundries. SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts. @ Improving font rendering time Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast it's not as fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size. $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you currentfontmem =	% type this line ... 300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes 1024 setfontmem % Just to check: currentfontmem = 1024 See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page. @ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup: $ mkdir $HOME/myfonts $ cd $HOME/myfonts $ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b Creating Bembo20.afb $ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. $ ls Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list $ bldfamily * Bembo		       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin) cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory $ xset +fp `pwd` $ xset fp rehash If you want the server to see your new font directory every time add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one of your start-up files e.g. .login or .profile. @ Converting between font formats (convertfont etc.) You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server by converting them to a bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf. Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to X11 bdf format which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows. You can also use der Mouse's getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf @ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi There aren't any.  More precisely the various text fonts such as Lucida Typewriter Sans are available at 100 dpi and in fact are scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps and don't scale very well. Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages @ No manual entry for cm_lookup If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands even though you are running OpenWindows try setting the MANPATH environment variable: MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH or setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems. @ window: Window creation failed to get new fd @ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Cannot create base frame.  Process aborted. These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an earlier windowing system for Suns and was not networked.  Some of the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin and have names that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead. Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin they're the same) or you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool cmdtool shelltool etc. @ memory fault - core dumped If you get this from the binder or if binder vanishes suddenly get the following patches: 100493-02 Binder 100524-03 Cetables 100626-03 Tooltalk @ Trouble compiling Xt Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt) contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: 100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu If you can't install the patch a workaround is to add -u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add -assert nodefinitions to CFLAGS in your Makefile or even in Imake.tmpl. Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type @ When I try to type into some programs I just get beeps or nothing happens It is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true *Input: TRUE in your .Xdefaults file as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. See the next item for editing .Xdefaults Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working @ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs Under OpenWindows 2 you need to add the following either to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead: XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\ <Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing L8 (the Paste key)! Under OpenWindows 3 this is already in the app-defaults file so if it isn't working check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S and if it isn't either set it or copy/merge the above lines from $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.

Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started OpenWindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm. If not start it.  If it dies check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot your workstation. Check that there is space in /tmp (use df /tmp) and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out. Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm (calendar) start a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade so don't remove those without checking first!

If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you using your display you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost +`hostname` (or xhost +happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation). This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display. With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth and the Programmer's Guide describes how to do this in Chapter 8 p. 101.  This is more secure. Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly! Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem.

Have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets. Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems @ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4) If refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm -C from your .xinitrc or start one up in the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the Workspace->Utilities menu.  Better still pick up contool and run that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears; it's very easy to configure. If refresh from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages go away... a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto a whole new (but monochrome) display called :0.1.  See the man. page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and if there's a /dev/cgfour0 does openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2 you might need to add this to your .xinitrc or other startup file: ( eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` olvwm -display unix:0.1 ) & Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also see the note about contool above. @ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults? Use `props' which appears in the default root menu as `properties'. This starts `props' a property editor which will re-write your .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.

This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0 there are various ways including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3  probably the best you can do (short of upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool. @ Why don't flat check-boxes work? A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these. A workaround is to edit the Guide output as it's only Guide's output that's broken not the actual check-box code. This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're still using an ancient DevGuide you should upgrade as soon as possible; the new one is fantastic! @ When I leave OpenWindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen. Try running clear_colormap; if this helps put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin'). @ When I use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something. This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv 2.21 or xgrabsc. @ Why have some of my function keys stopped working? Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37 respectively in OpenWindows 3.

(see also next item) @ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows (see also next item) Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch level 18) but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to OpenWindows 2.0 although you could also the do same sort of thing with OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5. Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows and X11R4 or X11R5 they're all compatible in this respect. Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11. Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH so that you get OpenWindows versions of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate although this is a matter of preference.  In any event put the OpenWindows bin directory first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have /bin (or /usr/bin they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview you'll get SunView programs instead of OpenWindows ones! Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last after the X11 library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0 but with older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item) although xdm core dumps if this isn't right. Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't /usr/openwin. See Also: Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH). @ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11 use /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib If you put this in a shell script or your .profile use ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for /bin/sh; for csh it is different. @ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches and install the patch. @ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me? You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw the PostScript text and pictures. If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0 compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM. If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0 you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia!) The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2. Note that the data files are in PostScript so you can look at them with a PostSript viewer (q.v.). @ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb? A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z @ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu? It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties Key (L3) though or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it. @ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool Sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also works if you run command tool on a remote machine. Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2. @ When I run OLIT programs some of the widgets are red! Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus. To disable it in most places add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file: *traversalOn: off *TextEdit.traversalOn: on *TextField.traversalOn: on You can change the color using (for example) *InputFocusColor: grey50 *input*FocusColor: green *List*inputFocusColor: <your background color> See the man page resources(3w) at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation. Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30 the OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch. @ When I run several programs the colors on the screen all change when I move into a different window! (colormap flashing) This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time. However you can minimise the effect with the following procedure: *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve. *  Run cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file *  Put the line cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc) *  Exit and then restart the window system. *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them. Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window and Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page. @ pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash (see above): This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows. Try running pageview like this: $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono $OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard @ XDM breaks things Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'. Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well. SunView applications may need to be run with svenv as in svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables. Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root which is a security hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start Unix processes ass root... @ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working In OpenWindows 3.0 the X11 names (keysyms) for these keys was changed to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.	 Code which uses them should be recompiled or you might be able to get away with xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36' Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears which has been promised but hasn't reached here.	Note that there is also a usenet newsgroup alt.toolkits.xview although it doesn't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month.	You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x. @ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items? PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle. PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles. There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font. You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function insert_row(list row string) that hides the nasty bits. @ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed? In the button callback do xv_set(button PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS XV_ERROR NULL); This will keep the window visible. You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute. @ how do I make an XView button look pressed? call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source... @ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly Here is Greg Earle's patch to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2 for example).

This list is for OpenWindows 3.0 -- differences for OpenWindows 2.0 are marked and I've added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5 too. DISPLAY  The name of the X Windows Display to use :0.0 (on the local machine the one actually running X11 or xnews) :0.1 (on some machines for a second monochrome screen) machine-running-unix:0.0 (on other machines) (You may need to do xhost +other-machine to let programs on other machines use your display; see also under Trouble Shooting and see the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmer's Guide pp. 101ff) See also: console messages under Trouble Shooting FONTPATH  Where xnews searches for fonts /usr/openwin/lib/fonts (you can also use xset fp+ dir to add a directory to the font path but you may have to do xset fp rehash afterwards.  This is fine under OpenWindows but many X11 servers have font problems) HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key (or F1) /usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/openwin/lib/help (On SunOS 4.0.* or with OpenWindows 2.0 omit the first entry which is for sites using a local other than C or USA). LD_LIBRARY_PATH   Where to look to find shared C libraries /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/CC/`arch` (the /usr/CC/`arch`/lib entry is only needed if you use C++ programs) OPENWINHOME	 Where OpenWindows lives /usr/openwin KEYBOARD MOUSE -- serial devices to use instead of the console (don't set these for normal use; /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse) PATH  Where the Shell searches for programs to run $(OPENWINHOME)/bin:$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview:/usr/local/bin:.\ $HOME/bin.`arch`:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/hosts:\ (you will certainly want to change this example!  There is no $(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview in OpenWindows 3.0) XFILESEARCHPATH  Where programs look for app-defaults files /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S (This is set automatically by openwin in OpenWindows 3.0) You might want to use /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S or perhaps both separated with a : for example (for sh users) XFILESEARCHPATH=$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S export XFILESEARCHPATH If you use X11R5 you might instead want /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S: $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S (put all this on one line though with no spaces!) Together with the following in lib/Xinitrc xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB' *customization: END_XRDB xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB' #ifdef COLOR *customization:  -color #endif END_XRDB you automatically get a color oclock editres bitmap xcalc and xlogo since they use the *customization resource appearing as %C in the XFILESEARCHPATH. (see oclock (n)) according to Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>. Subject: Where Can I get It? Ftp implementations etc... XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and elsewhere. MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form. OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun or you can get the source from Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V Release 4 implementations although that's not always the latest version. The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0. Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS and it is also included as the windowing system for Solaris. There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either available now or in progress.  Unfortunately none of them seem to be available from anywhere.  Contact anthony@ovi.com for more information. Subject: Bibliography: books manuals journals papers beer-mats The OPEN LOOK (tm) Graphical Interface is documented in two books: Sun Microsystems Inc. `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Application Style Guidelines' Addison Wesley 1989 and Sun Microsystems Inc. `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Functional Specification' Addison Wesley The Main documentation for the X Window system comes from O'Reilly & Associates in about nine or ten volumes. The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are: Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year) Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller] [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0] Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte] The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual together with other reference information so that in practice you have to buy both books. O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between X11R4 and RX115. OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5. There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5. A journal The X Resource may also be of interest.

The System V Release 4 Documentation from Prentice Hall may also include a section on OpenWindows. David Miller describes programming with OLIT in his `An OPEN LOOK At Unix' (M&T press). Nabajyoti Brkakati gives an excellent introduction to X and to OLIT programming as well as setting up and using X and OpenWindows in: `Unix[R] Desktop Guide to OPEN LOOK' SAMS 1992  ISBN 0-672-30023-0 You can get the examples from this book as export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/naba-olguide-examples.tar.Z Also about using OLIT and Xt in particular: The X Window System: Programming and Applications with Xt OPEN LOOK Edition Doug Young and John Pew Prentice Hall 1992 ISBN 0-13-982992-X There are also HP Widgets and Motif (ugh) versions of this book. The example source code in this book can be obtained by ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/young.pew.olit.Z. There is an introduction to XView in `Writing Applications For Sun Systems' Vol 1 `A Guide for Macintosh(R) Programmers' (Sun Microsystems pub.

PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook Adobe Systems Inc. Addison Wesley 1985 [The blue book] There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS). Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper) and vary from about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's Guide' on the front.  The User manuals have a red stripe on the bottom and the Programmer ones have a green stripe. 800-6006-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Release Manual 800-6029-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Installation and Start-Up Guide 800-6231-10 OpenWindows Version 3 DeskSet Reference Guide 800-6618-10 OpenWindows Version 3 User's Guide 800-6323-10 Desktop Integration Guide [also available in bookstores?] 800-6027-10 Programmer's Guide 800-6005-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Reference Manual [the man pages] 800-6319-10 The NeWS Toolkit 3.0 Reference Manual 800-6736-10 NeWS 3.0 Programming Guide 800-6055-10 OLIT 3.0 Widget Set Reference Manual 800-6198-10 XView 3.0 Reference Manual: Converting SunView Applications 800-6854-10 F3 Font Format Specification [order separately] There are also some other sets of documentation including the TypeScaler documentation from the OpenFonts group for example.

AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT. Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7 though). Volume 8 of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration and mentions OpenWindows although it is primarily aimed at X11R5. Several other books are in the works...

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  IMHO it contains a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated. If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired you can retrieve this FAQ from an archive site. There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about them and how to access them please see the Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. I don't think it's stock MIT but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially. Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock Xterm Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients etc).  If you use more than one then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.

Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below. If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z ...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog!  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it.

I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw etc) - These take up RAM and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu mouse settings { Mouse Settings:			f.title   Very Fast				! xset m 7 10 &   Normal (Fast)			! xset m 3 10 &   System Default (Un-Accelerated)	! xset m default &   Glacial				! xset m 0 10 & } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out: - For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions corrections or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

"1","Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window and I want it to have some background color say red and draw an oval in it. Further when I resize the window I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000. My problem is this: when I resize the window only the original part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. For example I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400 the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window? Second question: Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are??? Thanks Chris"

"1","Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already  and can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is: Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the data  is  arriving  over a slow link or the $DISPLAY is across a slow link) they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the picture  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution with each  4x4  square  of pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be painted. Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a small  bitmap  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X server  can help.  That is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process (Permission denied ;-) and have it open a local window? It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up such  a  program  remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to  expand. But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help it's be nice to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs  but  if  it's  there  I obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy. Oh yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build demos  that  can  show such things as If this were run across say a 4800-bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear.  Then  the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for. -- If the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would  now cost $5 would get 5000 miles to the gallon and at random times would explode killing all its passengers."

Ghostview is a postscript previewer that uses ghostscript. From the ghostview README: Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript. Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4. Brief list of features: - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions. - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures. - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our European friends. - Scrollbars appear when necessary. - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait Landscape Upside-down and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction). - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale or color on a Color monitor.) - Ability to mark pages for printing or saving.  (Good for people that printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.) - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution (1 display dot = 1 printer dot). The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people are encouraged to use in other programs. Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z From the ghostscript README: ***************************************************** * This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. * ***************************************************** ******** ******** An overview of Ghostscript ******** ******** Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language which very closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the Ghostscript language. The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely in C with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms. Currently Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform families: - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA VGA SuperVGA or compatible graphics under MS-DOS 3.1 3.3 or 5.0; - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11 release 3 4 and 5 including Sun-3 Sun-4 Sun-386i Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix; H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2; Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo; - Sun workstations (Sun-3 SPARC Sun-386i) running SunView; - VAX VMS with X11R3/4/5 gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler version 3.1 or later is required).

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course I'm biased...) DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers that uses a standard X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol allowing you to display them or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display on the net). Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform; many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications. (Often you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you already own all the clone equipment then there are lots of such programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine). *BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone. (From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better. In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM ethernet card very high performance graphics card GOOD monitor server software TCP/IP for clone software mouse keyboard etc etc etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$). I can get 15 Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900 and the performance is over 80000 Xstones..... -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | Mark A.

"1","I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+ under OpenWindows 3.0. The application uses XView stuff to create my window and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the Canvas. The application does real-time 2-D animation but it does not update the the display fast enough. I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my update routine and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also it appears to be compute bound because if I run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even more. Any ideas ? Thanks."
"1","I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to include in a manual. I have tried: xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd from a login on a remote terminal but it doesn't work. Xwd seems to wait for the window server but the window server doesn't answer. Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen.

"1","Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System ------------------- If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style like this... // mini sample application ///////////////////////////////////// class Test : public XmWindow { void cmd(char*); void quit(void*); public: Test() : XmWindow(Xm++ Test Window) {} void initialize(); }; void Test::initialize() { XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu(); menu->addLabel(&File); menu->addItems( Entry(Menu Item &One CB(Test::cmd)) Entry(Menu Item &Two CB(Test::cmd)) NULLENTRY); menu->addSeparator(); menu->addItem(	Entry(E&xit CB(Test::quit))); addSubpane(Edit myEdit); edit(myEdit)->setText(Hello World.); } void Test::cmd(char* n) { edit(myEdit)->setText(n); } void Test::quit(void*) { exit(0); } void XmApp::initialize() { (new Test)->initialize(); } /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README): Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11 and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows) but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-). Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows' 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution) Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText' 'staticImage' 'pushButton' 'checkBox' 'radioButton' 'edit' 'listBox' 'comboBox' 'groupBox' 'paneArea' 'drawing' 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects. CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991) an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound alternative input devices). If you are interrested look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines rectangles circles...) but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an object) this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. About this first release: Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications. Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on: HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07 SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1 PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6 Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

If you don't do this the >cursor will be hard to track when in motion. You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors smaller block cursors) turn on and off blinking set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok enough advertising. I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text) I'd say it won't be easy since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10). The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped. As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version. As is emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else than a csh. There is a fix to this which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

"1","Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion... Color Coordination... I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no one responded at all. The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table devotes itself solely the window manager icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working. ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers Animation Real Time video Raytracers etc... . The following is a suggested color table for icons and general use. Icons Window Managers and general applications should follow this table or something like it UNLESS the application is ``color needful''. * for each primary color (redgreenblue) three colors EG: values   0 128 and 255. This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons. * two extra shades of grey EG: vales    (black) 0 64 128 196 and 255 (whitered...) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager. This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the workstation.

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another. This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used. 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual) Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands. xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge - This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire program also uses a variation however I wrap it as part of the remote command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth) Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required. The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also pass environment variables as well as the current directory.  You will however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories. WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended. The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from the view of other users. 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable. This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly. A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the actual call to rlogin is performed to include your DISPLAY and your authorization. On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or stty'ing your terminal. ---8<--- script for launching rlogin: #!/bin/sh # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display: if [ -n $DISPLAY ]; then case $DISPLAY in :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;; esac TERM=$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY` export TERM fi rlogin $* ---8<--- add to your .cshrc or .login if ( $?TERM ) then if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge - setenv DISPLAY `echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f2` setenv TERM    `echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f1` endif endif ---8<--- xterm command to use xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname ---8<--- 3/ NFS. Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to. Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted then authorization is automatically passed Hoever you will still have to pass your DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE: login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host` 4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information. This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known by others nor should it be easy to determine. A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone who is asking. This last method was developed last year by a second year here untill I explained to him the need for the encryption at which point he gave up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but less secure.

"1","This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking: I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0 which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen. My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1 even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions: static Bool next_savescreen(scron) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; { /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */ if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { nextSetLastEventTime(); } if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */ next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle); NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle 0.0); /* Blank the screen */ } else {											 /* Unblank the screen */ NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle next_save_screen_brightness); } return TRUE; } I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver but I cannot find where it wakes up the server and unblanks the screen.

"1","Hi I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events so that when the program exits I can save the last known geometry in some sort of 'preferences' file. I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell: XtAddEventHandler(topLevelStructureNotifyMaskFalseconfigureCBmyData); This works fine and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). However when I'm just resizing the window using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure structure like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct. When I reposition the window using the window manager the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x y width height member settings. Q1: Anybody know why when just resizing the x and y are being set to zero? Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x y width height resources.

This means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 You can ask for the follwogin: -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you.

I want to connect this to a widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards. But because the drawing takes some while I want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted.

I looked >twice at porting emu to linux but stopped short becuse of the tty >part. Is there a `cleaner' version of emu that supports POSIX tty >explicitly? Hmm depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for call it operating system types then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a OS flavor yet that is fully POSIX we haven't gotten around to really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times this only uses up some disk space since only the drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into emu. It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff but unfortunately I don't have a linux system available to me so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or questions contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu since we just don't have access to that many different systems.

In xvttool simply create a key file that looks like: a	A b	B c	C ... and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate any input into any other (in my case lo-case to up-case).  Works great and you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side. To use an xterm solution add to your .Xdefaults: capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>a: string(A)\n\ ... or: capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\ <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\ <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\ ... and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm Thanks loads! -- Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov"

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt). You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this is the hard part).  Then in the callback that starts the drawing you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean... TRUE when you are finished and FALSE when you want to keep processing.  If you return FALSE the workProc is automatically re-installed. Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop since events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you are using the same Ada bindings I am however you are hosed and should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt). ---------- Joe Hildebrand hildjj@fuentez.com Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts (703)273-1447 Standard disclaimers apply"

"1","Hi netters: We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h: #if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__) #       include <string.h> #       define  index   strchr #       define  rindex  strrchr #else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */ #       include <strings.h> #endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's distribution) mentions this problem: BUGS If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  Berkeley  C preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all #if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have its own parser written for #if expressions. Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

Asher Yes Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what folks can purchase today and you have a complete show focused on X11. Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: Bob Schiefler Lu Abel Mark Ackerman Paul Asente Doug Blewett Donna Converse Jim Fulton Oliver Jones Keith Packard Ralph Swick Doug Young and many others. Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational; and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT. With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing applications for in-house or custom use a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT so must their developers and suppliers. The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment this is the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft get them to show you what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself. I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a confusing place at the moment with UNIX COSE NT DCE CORBA and all of the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion. -Aub Harden Technical Program Manager harden@ics.com X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade ******    *****    Show for Corporate *      *       *    Software Development ******     *** *         *    201 Broadway ***     *****     Cambridge MA  02139 Windows on Distributed Computing June 7 - 11   San Jose CA xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555 Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions Inc."

What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]? In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols notably to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling -Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic appears to work.

"1","Hi I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1). Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays I need different values for the same resource so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files. However cpp is only invoked by xrdb and not when the resources are loaded on demand. Is there a proper solution to this? So far the only proper solution I've come to think of is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/ say XTerm and XTerm-color and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color. But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH). Furthermore I thought of using #include XTerm in XTerm-color. However for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color things are different on both machines. On a Sun the FIRST found resource is used (i.e. the one from XTerm the b&w one) while on an RS/6000 the LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do about it? I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH I can use %T %N %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults %N for the resource class but what do %C and %S stand for?

I wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it. I've done this fine but I've turned up the following problem: When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of the above events but when they are not sensitive I only get callbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing. Is this a bug?  If not can someone explain this behavior? thanks Mark"

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be >a problem but a couple dozen should be fine. Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem except over a wet string network. One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process and does not add any transactions it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase in overhead especially as the application may have quite a large working set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor there could be as many as 50. If you want to go there I wouldn't start from here! Nick Maclaren University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory New Museums Site Pembroke Street Cambridge CB2 3QG England.

Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself: o Complete on-line context sensitive help system. o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript. o Rotated Text support! o Source code for the demo is provided. The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9). There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory: Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x) HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9) If you have any questions about the demo send an e-mail to: support@bristol.com. If you want another version of the demo (rs6000etc...) please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com. Remember to use binary mode! What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter. HyperHelp 3.0 ------------- HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one line function call application developers can access the full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF project and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility. This allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between MS Windows Motif and Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler! New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windowsa character based viewer segmented bitmaps SGML support and an improved History window. Xprinter 2.0 ------------ Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new X based applications very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for our demo and see Xprinter in action. If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support to your application Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for UNIX SVR4.2. Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about HyperHelp and Xprinter. If you have any questions or comments send them to us at: info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

"2","Archive-name: ripem/faq Last-update: Sun 7 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500 ABOUT THIS POSTING ------------------ This is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM a program for public key mail encryption.  It (this FAQ not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem. This month I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think. DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS --------------------- 1)  What is RIPEM? RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except the intended recipient.) RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain except for the RSA routines which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc. 2)  How can I get RIPEM? RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada.  Therefore the following request is quoted from the README file: #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me #the author of RIPEM and a condition of your use of RIPEM. Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM. The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the friend. RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Last I looked this site contains only the source tree and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version. RIPEM as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on rpub.cl.msu.edu which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub/crypt/ and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree. 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS NeXT Linux AIX ULTRIX Solaris etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected and help of users is invited. 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though.  The users guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers including Berkeley mush Elm and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs. If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem. 5)  What is RSA? RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric or public-key.  This means that there are two different related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  (Note that the message sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real message. (See What is DES?) Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication the fingerprint of the message (See What is a fingerprint like MD5?) is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender. RSA was named for the three men (Rivest Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out more about RSA ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt. 6)  What is DES? DES is the Data Encryption Standard a widely used symmetric or secret-key crypto system.  Unlike RSA DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However DES is much faster than RSA. RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the DES key. DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by using multiple encryption with DES. 7)  What is PEM and how does RIPEM relate? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115. RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned. 8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read. RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security. 9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys. This does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc. 10)  What is a fingerprint like MD5? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication. MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator. MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321. 11)  What is PGP? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way though PGP does also use RSA. Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM: - PGP has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection. - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than PGP (in fact PGP 1.0 is not compatible with PGP 2.0.) - RIPEM uses RSAREF a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use. PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus PKP the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm claims that it is a infringement of that patent to make use or sell PGP in the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this PGP's original author Phil Zimmermann says in the documentation: #In fact if you live in the USA and you are not a Federal agency #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer because Public #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is #contraband. - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted and cannot be sent outside the U.S. and Canada.  However PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places. Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Note that the above facts both regarding patent and export restrictions are somewhat controversial; many people think it shouldn't be that way and some people interpret various documents differently.  Unfortunately discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in misc.legal.computing.  (See:  DISCLAIMER) 12)  What about RPEM? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark Riordan the same author as RIPEM. Its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin) Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes not just RSA. This claim is not universally accepted by any means but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons. RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP. 13)  What is MIME? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter. 14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM... You may wish to check the companion post ripem-attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main weak area is probably key distribution."

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS --------------------- 1)  What is RIPEM? RIPEM is a (not yet complete but useful) implementation of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection (optional) originator authenticity message integrity measures and non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: What is PEM?) RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain except for the RSA routines which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc. The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7. 2)  How can I get RIPEM? RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the README file that this law not be violated: #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me #the author of RIPEM and a condition of your use of RIPEM. Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM. RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a product of RSA Data Security Incorporated; they merely are helping distribute it. RIPEM as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on ripem.msu.edu which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access FTP there cd to pub/crypt/ and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree. 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS NeXT Linux AIX ULTRIX Solaris etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected and help of users is invited. 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though.

Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  Note that the message sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real plaintext. (See What is DES?) Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For originator authenticity message integrity and non-repudiation of origin services to be implemented the fingerprint of the message (See What is a fingerprint like MD5?) is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient or a dispute-resolving authority can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered. RSA was named for the three men (Rivest Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography in general ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information also may be in sci.crypt. 6)  What is DES? DES is the Data Encryption Standard a widely used symmetric or secret-key crypto system.  Unlike RSA DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However DES is much faster than RSA. RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the DES key. DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability. 7)  What is a fingerprint like MD5? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication. MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy. MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator. MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321. There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true. 8)  What is PEM? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115. RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned. 9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read. RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM is planned but chicken-egg issues still exist. 10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM? This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310 the specification for Internet standards has a discussion (section 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key cryptography. This does not of course mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are compressed with a patented algorithm.) 11)  What about RSADSI/PKP? RSA Data Security Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S. patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents: Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (Diffie-Hellman)............................... No. 4200770 Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (Hellman-Merkle).................... No. 4218582 Cryptographic Communications System and Method (RSA)................................... No. 4405829 Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (Hellman-Pohlig).................... No. 4424414 PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for example the same person Jim Bidzos is president of both of them.) PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies (IBM DEC Motorola AT&T Lotus...) for use in their products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents. RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than its use of the RSAREF library and for no reason other than its author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography. However after the ball started rolling people at RSADSI got interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site and some people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing code.  RIPEM even won the Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992 award. 12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc. 13)  What is PGP? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way though PGP does also use RSA. A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM: - PGP has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection. - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself. - RIPEM uses RSAREF a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its patents to make use or sell PGP in the U.S. or Canada without either a license or written permission.  (See: DISCLAIMER) (See: What about RSADSI/PKP?)  Phil Zimmermann the author of PGP stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged but it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide: #In fact if you live in the USA and you are not a Federal agency #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer because Public #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is #contraband. - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted and cannot be sent outside the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places. Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Unfortunately it's not distributed separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to liability concerns. 14)  What about RPEM? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was written by Mark Riordan who later wrote RIPEM. Its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin) PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally accepted but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons. RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP. 15)  What is MIME? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter. 16)  What is TIS/PEM? Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH) rather than a stand-alone system and in beta test.  I don't know much more than that. 17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM... You may wish to check the companion post ripem-attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main weak area is probably key distribution."
"2","Archive-name: ripem/attacks Last-update: 31 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500 SOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM ------------------------------ This is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into great detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem. CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS --------------------- - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key. RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring. - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow an attacker to claim to be you. DES has only 56 bits in its key and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each message has a different DES key the work for each message would remain high. KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ---------------------- - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking RSA.  To safeguard it it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived from a passphrase you type in.  However if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network packets tapping lines or whatever) he could break the whole scheme. The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run RIPEM on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of you.  Ideally your own machine in your own home (or maybe office) which nobody else has physical access to. - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well he could re-encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along. It is important to get the proper public keys of other people. The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person; however this is not always practical.  Having other people vouch for you by signing a statement containing your key is possible although RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication. PLAYBACK ATTACKS ---------------- - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could still cause difficulties.  For example suppose you send a message with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection) to Alice which says OK let's do that. Your opponent intercepts it and now resends it to Bob who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course he may interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself register your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the unknown message. To defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient you should be sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory. LOCAL ATTACKS ------------- - Clearly the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example under UNIX a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depending how it's stored. In addition the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine which you are connected to via network (or worse yet modem) an eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your passphrase.) RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust obviously.  In the extreme case RIPEM should only be used on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses and so on.  However there's a very real trade-off between convenience and security here. A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation where other people have access (even root access) but increase security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked of course) executable on a floppy disk. Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system but when dialing in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you've just given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication. I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place.  Some people use two keys a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence. UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS ------------------------- - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic.  However once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message signed by you and readable by anyone although RIPEM does not provide this functionality.  Indeed the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work. Including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature.  Naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it."

"2","There are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt FAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify magnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some information from the horse's mouth. (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (clearing) meant to be *retained* within the controlled environment or declassifying the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment) From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security (NTISS) Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87): ------ 7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media (e.g. magnetic tape floppy disk cassettes and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character. Fixed media (e.g. Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this. Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction; however they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded. 7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.) If a fixed medium (for example a hard or Winchester disk) is operative an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character then its complement (e.g. binary ones and binary zeros) alternatively. When fixed  media become inoperative it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method.  In this case there are two alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk pack and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the vendor's facility have the magnetic media (e.g. disk platter) removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit. 7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media [see DoD Computer Security Center Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY] ------ This and many other interesting documents (many that are more informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures can be obtained (free) from: Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

First of all when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'' what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time. I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That of course means nothing at all. Then I wrote >Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus >than it is to generate it the increase in computer speed alone will >keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step i.e. people will >simply start using longer moduli and still be safe. What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm) then people would simply use longer moduli.

"2",">This thread brings up the more general question.  Can any crypto >implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not >available EVER be trusted? After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals but before IBM had decided to respond I argued strenuously that they should not; they should keep it proprietary. The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority.  In fact it has taken both of those plus more than 15 years. We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS invented and proposed by IBM and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir who are not subject to influence by any of these. Even now there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time all of the analysis and all of the public scrutiny. (Of course it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism developed in secret on the basis of authority alone.) We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can break the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can break anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time. The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way. At this point we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap. DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.

And does the phone company require written subpoena-able evidence of probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you could prove the offender had called you at a certain time your chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence are nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.

This actually supports Bill's speculation - IF there is a backdoor in RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA then it is more than natural that they will welcome ANY public-key implementation that uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY implementation that doesn't. I personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a long-precision modular arithmetic library that comes in source but of course the fact that -I- cannot see it means nothing...

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I do not believe that RSA would consent to such. However there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of implementations i.e. targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or maximum modulus size. It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within bounds it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose all of its motives and intentions.

The original one-way encryption I put into Multics about 1968 (as suggested by Joe Weizenbaum) was invertible.  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated this to me in May 1973.  I then asked an expert (who requested anonymity) what I should use instead; the expert's suggestion was to treat the 8-byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm which is similar or identical to DES.  This method or something stronger should take care of (a).  Issue (b) is discussed in comp.security.misc: longer passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords are the common tactics. tom_vanvleck@taligent.com"

It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets. There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation especially in America. What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects. As an analogy it's like they find a loose screw in your house and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know) and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms people may start to get the idea. As a matter of fact i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is without special-purpose hardware it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute which is pretty conservative but over time that's more than i need. If you think about it there's no point in actually encrypting random data because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this some of them will be put in jail. When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys you can tell them it's just random junk although of course they won't believe you.  While you're sitting in jail you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there. -- Joe Keane amateur cryptologist jgk@osc.com (uunet!amdcad!osc!jgk)"

Better yet instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system take it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal file system program that is used to create/delete files en/decrypt them to ramdisk list a directory. Put the util password protected on a floppy. The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead defrag your disk thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system. Now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on your disk at all :-). -- Ray Berry kb7ht ray@ole.cdac.com  rjberry@eskimo.com  73407.3152@compuserve.com"

For a good discussion of cryptographically good random number generators check out the draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt Internet Draft available at your local friendly internet drafts repository. A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic hash function (e.g. MD5) when fed with a large amount of more-or-less random data. For example running MD5 on /dev/mem is a slow but random enough source of random bits; there are bound to be 128 bits of entropy in the tens (or hundreds) of megabytes of data in a modern workstation's memory as a fair amount of them are system timers i/o buffers etc. /ji"

But they can make you piss in a jar and possibly provide DNA semen and hair samples or to undergo tests for gunpowder residues on your hand. (BTW that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion thrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking down the door -- the nitrogen in the urine would mask any residue from explosives.  I found it interesting the news reported his acts but not his reasons). Somewhere perhaps a privacy group they discussed the legal ramifications of using a password like I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden a while back.  The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss arguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law school sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has no bearing on the veracity of that phrase. You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g. where did you bury the body?); you are being asked to provide information necessary to execute a legal search warrant.  Refusing to provide the password is akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they could always _force_ their way into the locker. Of course that doesn't mean you have to help them _understand_ what they find or point out things they overlooked in their search! -- Bear Giles bear@fsl.noaa.gov"

"2","1. Do a straight encryption of your keyrings and put the results with misleading names somewhere they won't be noticed (eg. in the \windows directory; nobody knows what half those files are). 2. Do a straight encryption of a .BAT file that will decrypt the keyrings to RAMdisk and will set PGPPATH to point at it. 3. Set up another .BAT file to decrypt and execute the first (again on RAM disk). Have it take the name of the target file as an argument so that there is no link between this file and the (non-existent) batch file referred to by the rest of the system. Comment it so it looks like a test script for fooling around with PGP. Set PGPPATH to the PGP directory. 4. Leave the original keyrings that came with PGP in the directory with PGP; a good indication that you are playing with but haven't made serious use of PGP. Add a set of keys with your name and a really simple passphrase. Never use it or use it as your widely published key for low-security e-mail. 5. When needed run the second .BAT file.

No but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where as it happens evidence that will convict you is stored. The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet but current law suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn over the key. The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g. subpoena duces tecum). Moreover the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. Of course they can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against you. --Mike -- Carl Kadie -- I do not represent any organization; this is just me. = kadie@cs.uiuc.edu ="

Generally today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist. In email messages additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes. _____ <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet? The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication privacy and security which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks. For example the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems. Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication' and one classic example of the problems associated with it is H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery. However the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him.  Some prejudices are erased but on the other hand many prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors.  Likewise he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the connection  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance. Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. Many government functions and services are based on identification and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures.  But when does identification invade privacy? The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users especially as the network becomes increasingly global universal widespread and entrenched; and the positive or adverse affects of these actions intended and inadvertent  will literally be magnified exponentially. _____ <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background? Your email address may contain information that influences people's perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as from a department at a particular university an employee at a company or a government worker.  It may contain your last name initials or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system. Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your broad geographical location or nationhood.  However none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization such as (mostly invisible) network cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail. Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more information see the FAQs on email  addresses and known geographical distributions below.)  However UNIX utilities exist to aid in the quest (see the question on this). Common Suffixes --------------- .us    United States .uk    United Kingdom .ca    Canada .fi    Finland .au    Australia .edu   university or college .com   commercial organization .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization) .gov   government .mil   military site _____ <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address? One simple way is to send email to that address asking.  Another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e. postmaster@address) although the postmaster's job is more to help find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also be able to supply information.  Users with related email address may have information.  However all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally. One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is: finger user@here.there.everywhere This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named.  The response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows: - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect two lines with no information and '???'. - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger utility may return this response in other situations. - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some computers will search only for matching user IDs others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database. At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often considered weak security however because `attackers' know valid user ID's to `crack' passwords. More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just as you can use these means to find out about others they can use them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one amazing case the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the identity of R. Morris author of the Internet Worm  through the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace by K. Hafner and J. Markoff. _____ <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet? Generally identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge frequently and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. Most people remember faces and voices the primary means of casual identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world. Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an individual. - Anyone with access to the account e.g. they know the password either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address in the From: line. - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. - As part of current mailing protocol standards forging the From: line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers. The status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general while possible forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification on the internet: - Internet mail standards described in RFC-822 are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example standards for mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail. - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites and there are delays in the propagation of this data. - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if they are not updated they will not find name addresses and even the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different interpretations at different sites. The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic is email comprising  millions of messages. _____ <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet? Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification. However they are not currently widespread require large amounts of data transfer standardized software and make some compromises in privacy. Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures' and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also the trend in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted information.  On the other hand advances in ensuring anonymity (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below. PRIVACY ======= _____ <2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet? Generally while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it (such as email) and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words others may obtain data associated with your account but not without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want any privacy some expect and demand it. _____ <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet? This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arousing passionate opinions.  On the internet some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent. Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution adopted by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it.  However the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries and is not centrally managed significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation. _____ <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks? - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However the sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources. - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue if even possible. - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can 'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use. Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography. _____ <2.4> How (in)secure is my account? By default not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. First your account must be secure from other users. The universal system is to use a password but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain  users of the system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords and may grant that access to others.  This means that they may read any file in your account without detection. Furthermore not universally known most UNIX systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in what commands you execute and when they are executed (in fact login information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links (described  in 'man ln'). UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed tools for monitoring and use them only to isolate `suspicious' activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file incorrect login attempts remote connection attempts etc.). Generally you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons: - Potentially every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else. - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks. - Erased files can under many operating systems be undeleted. - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users including anonymous ones. - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on ``X Windows (in)security''. Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users a much more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines: - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically. - Make sure to logout always. - Do not leave a machine unattended for long. - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password. - Avoid password references in email. - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file. - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station but be considerate. Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users especially in cases where you are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also be  aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords. (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions here.) _____ <2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories? The most important privacy considerations are related to file rights and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on your parent directory is off for users groups and other these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. Anything less may allow others to read change or even delete files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory. For a directory 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories) in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list the contents of the directory however requires the 'r' right. By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files and can be set in the shell with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'. Examples -------- traver.lance % ls -ld ~ drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/ Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home directory denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a directory and the next three columns mean that read write and execute rights respectively are permitted for that user.  For directories the `x' right means that contents (file and subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy is completely invisible to them. traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg traver.lance % chmod u=rwg=o= msg traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights from `group' and `other'. Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list of files and subdirectories and the 'x' right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size etc. For example suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--  the following is possible: ls foo These commands would fail independent of file rights: ls -l foo ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x the following are possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r' readable file named `file': ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo The following commands fail: ls foo ls -l foo (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.) _____ <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows? X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks particularly the human-computer interface. The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server. The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicated security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network and over wider regions than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X Windows. Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws  early versions of the X Window system are extremely insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users such that any user at a `trusted' machine is himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity): > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in > an environment where everyone trusts everyone or when only a > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and > mutual trust does not exist. With the access control list the `xhost' command may prevent some naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image or cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal easily-bypassed `trusted' security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X Hanging Open Security Terrible.''). New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990 local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex. (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> and Bill Marshall <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.) _____ <2.7> How (in)secure is my email? By default not very.  The characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ASCII the American Standard Code for Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every computer system uses this code and if not has ways of converting to and from it.  When you write a mail message by default it is being sent in ASCII  and since the standard is virtually universal there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows: - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message) such as a university. - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally. - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient. - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden. - Finally be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled. Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography which has its own set of caveats (for example unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email policies.'' _____ <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings? As punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke certain `privileges' such as emailing USENET posting or reading certain groups file transferring remote communications or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site which in many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are virtually no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures  for restricting use to any internet services and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access. Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations. In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email regarding that person's objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring unpopular opinions.) System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to 'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general however by tradition Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key'') or to `plonk' annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file). In cases where punitive actions are applied generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings are much more commonly restricted either to individual users or entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most commonly associated with the following `abuses': - harassing or threatening notes `email terrorism' - illegal uses e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material - `ad hominem' attacks i.e. insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness - inappropriate postings esp. binary files in regular groups `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some guidelines: - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy. - If possible avoid use of your company email address for private communication. - Use a disclaimer. - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post). - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be proprietary or `internal'. The following references are available from ftp.eff.com (see also the section on ``internet use policies''): /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 --- Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991 and 1992 including USENET hierarchies. /pub/academic/cases --- This is an on-line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed description of the items in the directory. /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability --- Notes on university liability for Usenet. _____ <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity? The public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. - You have control over most of this information with the utility `chfn' the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use `passwd -f'). - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering. - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is 'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them. - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file in your home directory. Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you (such as your full name). You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators. To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and remailing services that are very recently being established.  See below. ______ <2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me? The requirements and screening for getting a system administration job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax especially at universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often `hacking'.  In general commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background and government sites are extremely strict. The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send email or post USENET messages and potentially read either.  S/he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity which can potentially be misused. ______ <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet? For the numerous reasons listed above privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore large parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services). Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation is frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere). From the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders are pursued.  For example  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of USENET traffic and less so internet traffic is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic). ______ <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet? Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global international superhighway for data and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages postal mail and many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that many people consider completely private (such as their local hard drives) will literally be inches from global network connections. Also sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet. Most would agree that for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy so that privacy protection is automatic and may significantly improve safeguards. The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular provoking some to say that ``the cat is out of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In less idiomatic terms they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable. To date no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt for example) have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years. ANONYMITY ========= _____ <3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet? Simply stated anonymity is the absence of identity the ultimate in privacy. However there are several variations on this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a reputation under it in some area providing pseudo-anonymity. A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some service and hide all  signs of the association. All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. Nevertheless the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity. _____ <3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet? Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish. One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic social or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation. Sensitive personal potentially damaging information is often posted to some USENET groups a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network. Unfortunately extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity. _____ <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet? The chief means as alluded to above are masking identities in email and posting. However anonymous accounts (public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be effective as well but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large. Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet. New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication. _____ <3.4> What is `anonymous mail'? One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous server' that when activated by email to its address responds by allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations. To send anonymous mail the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination. The server `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above. Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer from a regular user account (no root system privileges are required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable; they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge. The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system although actually may be held liable regardless. These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses: - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of aliases at the request of the user but this has not been implemented yet. - Although an unlikely scenario traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the `outside' necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection. - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local network or government agencies. - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them. - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically  network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable  to their own system administrators who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered regarding it as illicit use. - In all cases a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user. Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information.  This practice not uncommon to hackers and the approach used by remailers is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely (such as revoking the account) all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently. See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''. _____ <3.5> What is `anonymous posting'? Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic capricious or risky local circumstances logging).  Make sure to test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many sites `autorespond' to test messages possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting'' before proceeding. Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information. This practice not uncommon to hackers is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators and similar consequences can ensue. See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''. _____ <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet? As noted many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community and these services should be used with great caution.  To summarize the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined unreliable and not completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses. - Others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered. - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common. - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem  possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with the use of passwords. - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers. Source code is being distributed tested and refined for these systems but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The field is not likely to improve considerably without  official endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least problematic approach and the most traditional to Usenet is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files. _____ <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet? New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity.  For example the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts thereby threatening its privacy can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation) would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing. However remailers run by corrupt operators are possible. The future of anonymous services on the internet is at this time highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had in the past. For example as part of new group creation the charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. Nevertheless the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics anonymous services are in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or instead of expansion cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of Usenet. * * * This is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ obtained via anonymous FTP to pit-manager@mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy/ or newsgroups news.answers sci.answers alt.answers every 21 days.

For more information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu. MISCELLANEOUS ============= _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''? With digital encryption and authentication technologies the possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may be one approach.  The issues of cryptography privacy and anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum (~Dec.1992). An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text: :: command: help user@host where `user@host' is your email address. _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''? These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker but most internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead a ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'. _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''? From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list: > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy > must create it for themselves and not expect governments > corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers > envelopes closed doors and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or > their opinions. See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below. See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks. _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools? Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology.  For example it is possible to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images typically the most 'noisy'. In addition when such an item is posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup) virtually untraceable  communication can take place between sender and receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following commands in the subject line: subscribe unsubscribe help _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'? `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them.  For example a company may not make public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems.  Or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ for alt.security. Some remarks of John Perry Barlow cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation directed to NSA agents at the First International Symposium on National Security & National Competitiveness held in McLean Virginia  Dec. 1 1992: > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into > an environment where any information which is at all interesting > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view > but you may differ... _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'? RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to query a remote user's login name after connection to a local communication socket (a connection of this type is established during FTP and TELNET sessions for example).  The standard is not widely supported perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a trend toward greater authentication mechanisms. _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy? Remailing/Posting ----------------- - Stable secure protected officially sanctioned and permitted publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs. - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET postings. - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining encrypted addresses etc.) - Standards for anonymous email addressing embedding files and remailer site chaining. General ------- - Recognition of anonymity cryptography and related privacy shields as legitimate useful desirable and crucial by the general public and their governments. - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies by systems designers into hardware software and standards implemented `securely' `seamlessly' and `transparently'. - General shift of use dependence and reliance to means other than wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement agencies. - Publicity retraction and dissolution of laws and government agencies opposed to privacy replaced by structures dedicated to strengthening and protecting it. ISSUES ====== _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)? From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement: > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital electronic > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an > electronic frontier. > > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like > newspapers books and telephones the new digital media do not > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as > the law struggles to define its application in a context where > fundamental notions of speech property and place take > profoundly new forms.

EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor founder of Lotus software and John Barlow lyricist for the Grateful Dead rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector Online) electronically send requests to effnews-request@eff.org. In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated November 5 1991  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12): > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create > a consumer-oriented public information network. Please let me or > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating > a reasonably priced widely available network in which > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on > structuring the information and communications networks of the > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the > information services industry. ftp.eff.org =========== /pub/eff/about-eff --- A file of basic information about EFF including goals mission achievements and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto Cambridge Washington DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation against the FBI The NSA NIST the Secret Service and other other U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation on issues such as Operation Sundevil the FBI wiretap proposal NSA's interference in crypography the breakup of the 2600 raid in Arlington Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on Congress state legislators and public utility commissions to testify on privacy information policy computer security and caller identification. CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available via FTP Gopher WAIS and email at cpsr.org currently comprising the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For more information anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/. (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions here.) _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case? In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery. (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04): > `Operation Sundevil' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May > 81990 concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card > abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success. > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America terrifying > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some > 24000 floppy disks and confronted harried Justice Department > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of > jurisdictions. Massive `show-trials' never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of Austin Texas on March 1 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine: > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional > warrant agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared > for publication private electronic mail and several computers > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only > innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place. > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system. FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1 1993: > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. > > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago who was in > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1 > 1990 that led to the lawsuit stoically endured Spark's rebuke > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of > computers since the crackdown began in 1990 this is the first > case to challenge the practice. > > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never > suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and > the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine > that the company was a publisher. Indeed agents testified that > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the > special Secret Service school on computer crime. > > How long would it have taken you Mr. Foley to find out what > Steve Jackson Games did what it was? asked Sparks. An hour? > > Was there any reason why on March 2 you could not return to > Steve Jackson Games a copy in floppy disk form of everything > taken? > > Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding tax-paying citizen > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect? > > Did it ever occur to you Mr. Foley that seizing this material > could harm Steve Jackson economically? > > Foley replied No sir but the judge offered his own answer. > > You actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go > out and hire a lawyer and sue you. > > More than $200000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

Notes ===== - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues are wholly unresolved. - So far all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP software (see the question on cryptography). - Encryption aspects (message text destination address replies) vary between sites. - Multiple chaining alias unlinking and address encryption are mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time. _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity? Users ----- - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others. - Do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others. - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on Usenet  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups. - If posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations. Remember simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic. - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt' hierarchy is preferred. - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e. references etc.) Remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle. - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself. - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege. - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity. - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation. Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead. - Be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating his hardware all for your convenience. Operators --------- - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring. Describe your background interest and security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz-faire? - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember your users trust you to protect them. - In the site introductory note give clear examples  of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g. warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke the account 'out' the user contact local administrator etc.) - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware. Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under ``(in)stability of anonymity''. - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running? What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is your commitment to it? - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item. Consult a lawyer about your liability. - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator consult those who do and are. - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If possible query group readers. - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header. - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations. Readers ------- - Do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its volume is heavy or increasing). - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence. - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy harassment extortion etc. - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally. - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself. - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or `conceivable' need exists. References ---------- See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity: > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous. _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings? James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>: > Try putting this in your kill file: > >   /Anon/h:j >   /Anonymous/h:j > > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't > kill followups. Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering. _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers? Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication such as talk.abortion and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises) but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through servers like there's no tomorrow.'' Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in researching the idea Karl Kleinpaste <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the server to new more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier across all.  This was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus against it. K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints and used this in three cases. Nevertheless after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server. ``Even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was created.'' In ~Nov 1992 Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail posting and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests. J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy). Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial. For example in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb 1993  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a New York news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity reverberating through many newsgroups. The original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated'' suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story (albeit crudely) free of personal risk from perceived association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors. Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news operators J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13000 users in its initial three months of operation forwards ~3000 messages a day and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned. Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several times at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5 hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the service's administration. In response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly. Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by ``cypherpunks'' J. Helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is currently in the process of code development and testing. He is planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple email aliases alias allocation control public-key encryption etc. A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec. 1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far.  However it was running on a public access account and he had to shut it down after only several weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the software to the public domain. Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on government abuses has received wide and focused attention and group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing easy-to-read documentation on posting anonymization and encryption.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key-escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system) the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: --   the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens; --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (information superhighways) will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message? A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is? A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product? A:   The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry? A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip? A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices. Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition.  Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques. Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware? A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products."

Quite literally the party is found guilty of holding the court in contempt. Now the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if certain threatening conditions are met. Once the key is gone there is no question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell the key is no longer there to be produced. Obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes (however extenuated) I think that this charge would be a hard nut to make. Perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up? -=*=-    -=*=-     -=*=-     -=*=-    -=*=- Vincent A.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key-escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system) the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: --   the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens; --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (information superhighways) will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message? A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is? A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product? A:   The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry? A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip? A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices. Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition.  Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques. Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware? A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products. -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday 25 Astron S.R. 1993 17:01"

As it says in both sci.crypt FAQs there's no way we are going to achieve the same level of comfort with Clipper that we finally have with DES if we can't actually get our hands on the bits and watch them flow around.  Even the best experts aren't going to think of everything: look how long it took Biham and Shamir to get a handle on just how good DES is... and for all we know there's still more to learn. -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday 25 Astron S.R. 1993 17:10"

In short the new technology can: 1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper. It cannot: 1) Protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations. 2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who handle them etc. 3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication. > Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government >      agencies to listen in on phone conversations? > A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with >      no new authorities to access the content of the private >      conversations of Americans.

Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system) the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: --   the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens; --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (information superhighways) will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message? A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is? A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product? A:   The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry? A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip? A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices. Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition.  Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques. Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware? A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products."

"2","April 16 1993 INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology. However EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called Clipper Chip is an 80-bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products. This proposal raises a number of serious concerns . First the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards. Second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent expert scrutiny. Third while the use of the use of a split-key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer. In sum the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However the Clipper Chip solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the discussion even begins. DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL: ESCROW The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device however not the person using it. Upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve) and one non-governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet. CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public. The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago. GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER In order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI Secret Service VP Al Gore and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing a number of people asked this question though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors? COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately however the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised but they terms have yet to be specified. FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry Berman Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

"2","Note:     The following was released by the White House today in conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip encryption technology. FACT SHEET PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT The President has approved a directive on Public Encryption Management.  The directive provides for the following: Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access. Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age. Despite its benefits new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves doing so will require new innovative approaches. In the area of communications encryption the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted information I hereby direct the following action to be taken: INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS The Attorney General of the United States or her representative shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. KEY-ESCROW The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications. PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES The Secretary of Commerce in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications.  Further the Attorney General shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase."

"2","Though some may argue about the nose of the camel it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy-to-break inverters. Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files let's focus on this. One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it. Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some I find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most Americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones. ------- Reading between the lines I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs. Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week and that system has worked pretty well. From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order. ------ In discussing this let's try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. -- David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted."

Presumably the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy of the key and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from both agents. However if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation of the other agent a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a brute force attack.  If an agency (for example the NSA) were to hold one of the two key-halves then I don't imagine they really need the other half of the key to start listening in.

"2","How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without being able to decode the traffic? i.e. In order to accuse me of using an unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank. I can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique used but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis.

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore any use of RSA other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law is similarly unlawful.

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communications link as opposed to storage where the keys have to be retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the data. The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman use it for a while and then destroy it. Once it's gone there's no getting it back and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation. To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle you have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone. This is nice and simple but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices. A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed.

"2","Okay let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call. I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes to listen in they only receive gobbledly-gook because the secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. That leads me to conjecture that: 1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country. The part about registering your keys is just bogus. or 2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this. Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to town. In either case I think we need to look at this a bit deeper.'jbl)mW:wxlD2"

"2","As of yet there has been no description of the general principles behind the Clipper proposal. For example is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person). Further the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system but it does make you think. Of course this is easily fixable by giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the real 80-bit key. Philip"

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key-escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system) the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: --   the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens; --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (information superhighways) will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message? A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is? A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product? A:   The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry? A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip? A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices. Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition.  Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques. Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware? A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products."
"2","This may be a stupid question but how does the government know which keys to ask for? Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones faxes modems etc. and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number? Will there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification (the National Health Care ID perhaps) be required when purchasing a Clipper-equipted phone? Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records but this information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave relay station). This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications encryption key.  Will it be something that is derived from information exchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by an eavesdropper? -- Bear Giles bear@fsl.noaa.gov"
"2","The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from them doing more than this. This is a voluntary program and thus harder for us to object to on the surface. Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for most phone companies. You see with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share they will rule. And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police. Well some people will buy these phones but they will only work with other proprietary phones so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap only the Mob will buy them. And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones because the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police.

"2","I'm quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating `acceptable' speech and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure. I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty. >While encryption >technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the >unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used >by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals. It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't it's a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless.) Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong cryptography (including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums) we have a sustainable equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom. >For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our >private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the >tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of >protecting Americans. For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting Americans. >Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important >role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act >quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding >its use.

It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights. The administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp. on this issue.  The government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it. >Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological >     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be >     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more >     powerful encryption devices? No such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent to a veiled threat which I don't appreciate.  This kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism.

The U.S. comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that. Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.

"2","Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject in this post) the name Clipper Chip seems very confusable with the Clipper chip of Intergraph. Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor Clipper was a 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations notably those from Intergraph the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National Semiconductor several years back. When I first saw Clipper Chip in the announcement I immediately thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know. This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue but then I'm not a lawyer.

This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. If the clipper doesn't impose any unfortunate performance side-effects there's no reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted traffic.

If Brad's analysis is correct it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed back door.  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips. (It would be nice from the point of view of personal privacy if Brad turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper privacy is still possible.

"2","My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret : The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.   There will be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this chip like it or not. If the alrogithm is public and the code is as secure (absent the access to escrowed keys) as represented an enterprising sort would make compatible crypto chips for which no key had been escrowed.  This is likely what the release was refering to when they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the security of the escrow system. rob boudrie"

Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is the ACLU and the other is the EFF.

Indeed as pointed out since the current systems even the current digital systems are very easy to decode -- right now anybody with an old TV can hear them -- for most people this will be viewed as an oh goody step upwards. And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the neighbours with the radios hear right now. It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping is going on right now without warrants because anybody can do it and it's just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.

"2","It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure. It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses. What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses. Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants I assume.  At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip. That's if we go with this scheme which I am not sure I agree with. -- Brad Templeton ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale CA 408/296-0366"

It would be stupid to rely on even a Clipperized channel for truly sensitive material but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example even with my strong right to bear arms view of the private right to possess and use strong cryptosystems the system as described provides enough security that I would actually buy a cordless phone and would be much less wary of using cellular phones walkie-talkies and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market voice scrambling I actually don't see a problem with it. If you want more security than it offers use something different.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 days. Contents: * In mathematical terms what is a private-key cryptosystem? * What is an attack? * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically? * Why is the one-time pad secure? * What's a ciphertext-only attack? * What's a known-plaintext attack? * What's a chosen-plaintext attack? * In mathematical terms what can you say about brute-force attacks? * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy? * In mathematical terms what is a private-key cryptosystem? A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of functions E_K indexed by ``keys'' K mapping some set of ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext.  Such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems. * What is an attack? In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state mathematically what this means. Here we go. Fix functions F G and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys. An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an algorithm A with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1...P_n) if we have f = F(P_1...P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1)...E_K(P_n)). Note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector (KP_1...P_n). The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at least p of computing h = H(P_1...P_n) if f = F(P_1...P_n) and g = G(C_1...C_n). Here C_1...C_n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to P_1...P_n. In other words an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions E_K(P_1)...E_K(P_n). An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1 ``two-ciphertext'' if n = 2 and so on. * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically? In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure. Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong!'' In contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong. We say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isn't easy to break. Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid. The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis. * Why is the one-time pad secure? By definition the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings (say byte strings) of some length m and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive or) of K and P. It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad assuming a uniform distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack i.e. an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e. g = G(K + P)). Then because the distribution of K is uniform and independent of P the distribution of K + P must also be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C) over all P and C. Thus a fortiori A is trivial.) On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used for more than one plaintext: i.e. there are nontrivial multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad''; this explains the name ``one-time pad.'' * What's a ciphertext-only attack? In the notation above a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1)...E_K(P_n)) about n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information H(P_1...P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1...P_n) when given G(C_1...C_n) for random C_1...C_n. For example say G(C) = C and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack'' which simply guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which produces one bit of information about P with 100% success using C. If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is a nontrivial attack. * What's a known-plaintext attack? The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1P_2) = P_1 G(C_1C_2) = (C_1C_2) and H(P_1P_2) depending only on P_2. In other words given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption P_1 the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption P_2. Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless: the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages. * What's a chosen-plaintext attack? A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway a chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.'' A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext. There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks: for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext P as TE_K(h(T+R+P)RP) where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew for each message R is a random number and h is a one-way hash function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or. * In mathematical terms what can you say about brute-force attacks? Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some plaintexts P_1...P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1...C_{n-1}. We're also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n we print D_K(C_n). If n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys. * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy? Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed and it's much faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace. We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information'' of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within 2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K where p_K is the probability of key K."

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break. The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli [BER91]. Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South Orem UT 84058) 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will decrypt any WordPerfect Lotus 1-2-3 Quatro-Pro MS Excel and Paradox files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices but if you think your pw key is less than 10 characters (or 10 char) give them a call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files that have a 10 char or less pw key.'' * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher? A repeated-key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on) is called a Vigenere cipher. If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English do the following: 1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences. (See Gaines [GAI44] Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal. If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different key then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key. 2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since English has about 1 bit of real information per byte 2 streams of text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.) If the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods in the hands of an expert if there's only ten times as much text as key. See for example Gaines [GAI44] Sinkov [SIN66]. * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP RIPEM PEM ...] Here's one popular method using the des command: cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail Meanwhile there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through 1424. To join the PEM mailing list contact pem-dev-request@tis.com. There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this writing. There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ as well. PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily) in the USA. RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside the USA. Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time (as far as we know). * Is the UNIX crypt command secure? No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB]. * How do I use compression with encryption? A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method (e.g. XOR with a repeated key). Unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model he'll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output. Note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy. For example the output of UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number'' that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis. This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea; it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption. Compression after encryption is silly. * Is there an unbreakable cipher? Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext. Of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful. Rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid. * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography? Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of 0th through N-1st bits for all N up to the lifetime of the source. A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent.  Ideally it should also be truly random (perhaps generated by a hardware random number source). Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy by not connecting anything to it.  For example cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random string. When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human it must be random.  For example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy. * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)? See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one. Unicity distance like all statistical or information-theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results: namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest. Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than D ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to 8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately D characters have been intercepted. In fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it's too small but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack some cipher messages. However similar information-theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem. Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions. Unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal 1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the possibilities see [KUL68] and [GOO83]. * What is key management and why is it important? One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of course one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling Mossad about its cryptosystems but Mossad probably finds out anyway.) Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic. Key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys. A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the STU III secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation/maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost CIKs. This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem. For public-key systems there are several related issues many having to do with ``whom do you trust?'' * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream? Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures--- but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all. See [KNU81] exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89]. * What is the correct frequency list for English letters? There are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before. You can find the first answer in various books: namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken. The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized. It has changed over time; it is different between different authors. Any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole. The third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as English in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter. In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with reasonably robust answers. So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly. * What is the Enigma? ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by the British during WWII.'' See [WEL82] [DEA85] [KOZ84] [HOD83] [KAH91]. * How do I shuffle cards? Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this you need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that function you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two addresses given) for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )] &arr[n] ) ; modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the error will be very small.  To cover this case one can take ranno()'s modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno() returns a value less than y go back and get another ranno() value. * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM? Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy. As far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard.  If there were such an identification then the CD-ROM could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier.  However in this case the CD-ROM is one of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose. If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data. The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy. * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers? schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

The parts are mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part. The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 days. Contents: * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break? * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A by a C every B by a D and so on through the alphabet. Only someone who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages. A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis. The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext. A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here. The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients. Other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third parties. * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? For an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well written. However these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last 50 years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid-60's. Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one. The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of security. Similar comments apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89]. The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in the development of DES and both books give a thorough analysis of DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks. The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography. * How does one go about cryptanalysis? Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and luck. The best available textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still classified. Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems. * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search. Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches---or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster. Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute-force search is impractical. Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical. For example DES which has been in use for over 10 years now has 2^56 or about 10^17 possible keys. A computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search. Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91]. One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities. * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret. A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above.  The unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably strong. A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests (see for example [CAE90]). A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect. If a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first. However sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system then he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that it's a crap shoot. * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance he might assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn't have a chance. Sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once! Even chosen-plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed. See [KAH67]. * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break? Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system."

It becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main concern of most of us I think. The camel's nose in the tent etc.) And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by the government (the conversations being encrypted who will object to letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically archiving large fractions...).

Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it. You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the readers want to see. * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing comp.org.eff.talk comp.patents sci.math comp.compression et al.; for the benefit of people who don't care about those other topics try to put your postings in the right group. Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either. * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt? ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt. If you have come up with an encryption scheme providing some ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm but this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most sci.crypt readers won't bother with. So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the introductory textbooks. When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at large try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily answered on your own. If you really think your system is secure and you want to get some reassurance from experts you might try posting full details of your system including working code and a solid theoretical explanation to sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated in some areas.) If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted. You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance noted cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough experience then most likely any experts who look at your system will be able to find a flaw. If this happens it's your responsibility to consider the flaw and learn from it rather than just add one more layer of complication and come back for another round. A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope of this FAQ. Among professionals a common rule of thumb is that if you want to design a cryptosystem you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst."

A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition/multiplication and linear transformation. (A ``block cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes say---all at once then goes on to the next block.) The notion of product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84] DES [NBS77] SP-networks [KAM78] LOKI [BRO90] FEAL [SHI84] PES [LAI90] Khufu and Khafre [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER DES LOKI and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers. The following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers: cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds LUCIFER          128               128                16 DES               64                56                16 LOKI              64                64                16 FEAL              64               128            2^x x >= 5 PES               64               128                 8 * What makes a product cipher secure? Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher ``looks highly random''. For example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing'' function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion. The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as S-boxes. For example LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes and DES has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria for the S-boxes of DES which apply to S-boxes in general may be found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86]. * What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers? Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks. Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then for any fixed K the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}. The collection of all these permutations P_K where K ranges over all possible keys is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate a large subset of S_{2^N}. Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations i.e. all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.) Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N} given a sufficient number of rounds. The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys K1 K2 there does not exist a third key K3 such that E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**) which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys K1 K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If for every K1 K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then we say that E is a group. This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was extensively studied by Sherman Kaliski and Rivest [SHE88]. In their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93]. * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher? Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K appears to be a random element of S_{2^N} the symmetric group. Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time. That is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing. Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions. * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size? There are four standard modes of operation (and numerous non-standard ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S. Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81 published in 1980.  See the question about ECB below for more details. Although they are defined for the DES block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher. * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication? One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key. See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message authentication using DES. * What exactly is DES? DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data using a 56-bit key. It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)]. FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS. DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. * What is triple DES? Triple DES is a product cipher which like DES operates on 64-bit data blocks.  There are several forms each of which uses the DES cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys some use three. The DES modes of operation may also be used with triple-DES. Some people refer to E(K1D(K2E(K1x))) as triple-DES. This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985 Financial Institution Key Management and is intended for use in encrypting DES keys and IVs for Automated Key Distribution.  Its formal name is Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key Pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE. That standard says (section 7.2.1): Key encrypting keys may be a single DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed (e.g. the data protected by the key(s) has a long security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key. Others use the term triple-DES for E(K1D(K2E(K3x))) or E(K1E(K2E(K3x))). One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form E(K1 TRAN( E(K2 TRAN( E(K3 COMPRESS( x )))))) where each DES instance has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part.) * What is differential cryptanalysis? Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by Biham and Shamir [BIH91] but Coppersmith has remarked that the S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago. This method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably FEAL [BI91a]. Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts Y Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X X' satisfy a known difference D = X+X' where + is componentwise XOR. In the basic Biham-Shamir attack 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs. For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts. The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling observations on the algorithm. Most importantly if the key schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES. Further the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack. Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991) ``I would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.'' * How was NSA involved in the design of DES? According to Kinnucan [KIN78] Tuchman a member of the group that developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying ``We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA.... `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms' explains Tuchman.'' On the other hand a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States Select Committee on Intelligence'' printed in the IEEE Communications Magazine p53-55 1978 states: ``In the development of DES NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.'' Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA. The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman presented above. * Is DES available in software? Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY]; Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK]. A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87]. FIPS 46-1 says The algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ... Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this standard.  Despite this software implementations abound and are used by government agencies. * Is DES available in hardware? The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors. We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products. Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES encryption/decryption device for use on standard digital 64Kbps PCM telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is 214-450-0400. You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom marketing.'' Christian Franke franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de says: ``1. Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet with 32 Bit interface. We use this one because it was the only one available when we started the project. No problems !  2. Pijnenburg PCC100: 20Mbit/s according to Data Sheet. Address: PIJNENBURG B.V. Boxtelswweg 26 NL-5261 NE Vught The Netherlands.  3. INFOSYS DES Chip (Germany): S-Boxes must be loaded by software. So you can modify the Algorithm. Sorry I don't have the data sheet handy.

If you require custom DES or Public Key ICs then Timestep Engineering developed Newbridge's crypto chips and ICs for other commercial and educational establishments. They can be reached at (613) 820-0024. * Can DES be used to protect classified information? DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says: This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and 2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act of 1947 as amended or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended. * What are ECB CBC CFB and OFB encryption? These are methods for using block ciphers such as DES to encrypt messages files and blocks of data known as modes of operation. Four modes of operation are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2) and also in ANSI X3.106-1983. FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets the unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1. FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks. The four DES modes of operation are: Electronic Code Book  (ECB) Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB) and K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB). These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation. Some symbols: P[n]	The n'th block of plaintext input to encryption output from decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode. C[n]	The n'th block of ciphertext output from encryption input to decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode. E(m)	The DES encryption function performed on 64-bit block m using the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key. D(m)	The DES decryption function performed on 64-bit block m using the same key schedule as in E(m) except that the 16 keys in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m). IV	A 64-bit initialization vector a secret value which along with the key is shared by both encryptor and decryptor. I[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable used in some modes. R[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable used in some modes. LSB(mk) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m. e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1) MSB(mk) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m. e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1) = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage. Electronic Code Book (ECB): P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long. Encryption:			Decryption: C[n] = E(P[n])		P[n] = D(C[n]) Cipher Block Chaining (CBC): P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long. Encryption:			Decryption: C[0] = E(P[0]^IV)		P[0] = D(C[0])^IV (n>0)	  C[n] = E(P[n]^C[n-1])		P[n] = D(C[n])^C[n-1] k-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB): P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long 1 <= k <= 64. Encryption:			Decryption: I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1] (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n])k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n])k) (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n] Note that for k==64 this reduces to: I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV (n>0)	  I[n] = C[n-1]			I[n] = C[n-1] (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n]) (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n] CFB notes: Since I[n] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the previous operation the E() function can be performed in parallel with the reception of the text with which it is used. k-bit Output FeedBack (OFB): P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long 1 <= k <= 64. Encryption:			Decryption: I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1] (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n])k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n])k) (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n] Note that for k==64 this reduces to: I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV (n>0)	  I[n] = R[n-1]			I[n] = R[n-1] (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n]) (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n] OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.  Since I[n] is independent of P and C the E() function can be performed in advance of the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used. Additional notes on DES modes of operation: ECB and CBC use E() to encrypt and D() to decrypt but the feedback modes use E() to both encrypt and decrypt.  This disproves the erroneous claim that systems which feature E() but not D() cannot be used for data confidentiality and therefore are not subject to export controls."

Contents: * What is public-key cryptography? * What's RSA? * Is RSA secure? * How fast can people factor numbers? * What about other public-key cryptosystems? * What is public-key cryptography? In a classic cryptosystem we have encryption functions E_K and decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext P. In a public-key cryptosystem E_K can be easily computed from some ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published so that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed from X then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages. That's the essence of public-key cryptography published by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. In a classic cryptosystem if you want your friends to be able to send secret messages to you you have to make sure nobody other than them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem you just publish X and you don't have to worry about spies. This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography applications of public-key cryptography other applications of the mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography and so on. * What's RSA? RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest Shamir and Adleman.  For full details there is a FAQ available by ftp at RSA.COM. Here's a small example. Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples (pqed) with p a 256-bit prime number q a 258-bit prime number and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq D_K(C) = C^d mod pq. Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pqe)---but as far as anyone knows there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair (pqe). So whoever generates K can publish (pqe). Anyone can send a secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages. * Is RSA secure? Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q. See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all for that matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but as Hendrik W. Lenstra Jr. says ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist and theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative results.'' * How fast can people factor numbers? It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes using about three weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine; each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers n but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in any case. An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple polynomial quadratic sieve'' which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100 and 150 digits depending on the implementations. Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are developed then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from factorization but one can't predict the future. (Before the number field sieve was found many people conjectured that the quadratic sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.) * What about other public-key cryptosystems? We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe. But there are lots of other public-key systems around many of which are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography consult the books and journal articles listed in part 10."
"2","Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part07 Last-modified: 1993/4/15 FAQ for sci.crypt part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions This is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part. The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 days. Contents: * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public private secret shared etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru? * What is a one-way hash function? A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't determine any usable information about a message with that hash not even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the same hash. A one-way hash function can be private or public just like an encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash function like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message and sign the hash which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the signature can do the same thing. Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function. * What is the difference between public private secret shared etc.? There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which isn't published we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption functions D so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have hashing functions H and verification functions V such that V(MX) = 1 if and only if X = H(M). A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private decryption. Checksums such as the application mentioned in the previous question have public hashing and public verification. Digital signature functions have private hashing and public verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message but everyone can verify that the hash is correct. Obviously when an algorithm depends on a private key it's meant to be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key isn't published so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend rather than ``for your eyes only'' are you suddenly doing ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No. * What are MD4 and MD5? MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest. Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is available from [FTPMD]. Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a though some people refer to it as MD5. * What is Snefru? Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function the newest in the family. Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from [FTPSF]."

The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 days. Contents: * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript? * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's and has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national security almost all information about the NSA is classified. Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography: ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors. Without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10 years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology. There have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities. Open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals. But can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers? One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen' but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which we are aware) have been so few and so mild.'' * What are the US export regulations? In a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce authorized by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department authorized by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule of thumb BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent requirements but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA. The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail; if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the ITAR. * What is TEMPEST? TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation (e.g. from a CRT) at quite a distance and with little effort. Needless to say encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext is available this way. * What are the Beale Ciphers and are they a hoax? (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for corrections.) The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in Bedford County Virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure. Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2; it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved; many documents have been tried as the key to B1. Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure: The Beale Cypher Association P.O. Box 975 Beaver Falls PA 15010 You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the line: send index in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions. (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.) Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI and found some unexpected strings including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP. Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this string couldn't appear by chance but feels there must be an explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this string. * What is the American Cryptogram Association and how do I get in touch? The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography with an emphasis on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in English and other languages are simple substitution Playfair Vigenere bifid Bazeries grille homophonic and cryptarithm. Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America; less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent to ACA Treasurer 18789 West Hickory St. Mundelein IL 60060. * Is RSA patented? Yes. The patent number is 4405829 filed 12/14/77 granted 9/20/83. For further discussion of this patent whether it should have been granted algorithm patents in general and related legal and moral issues see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as ``should RSA be patented?'' which often flooded sci.crypt and other technical newsgroups into a more appropriate forum. * What about the Voynich manuscript? nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list is: <voynich-request@rand.org> the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself of course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's The Codebreakers gives a good introduction."

Then I heard that folks were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this on reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress skip 10K) takes a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of solutions that launches the MD5 and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes use the MD5. This way I could have guaranteed good bits and a deterministic upper bound on login time and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds. -Bennett bet@sbi.com"

I could be wrong but I've seen no >mention of session keys being the escrowed entities. True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key as I understand it to it *could* be made effectively impossible to record. Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today. But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to listen to those tapes? can they? >worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper >to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main >concern of most of us I think. The camel's nose in the tent etc.) Yes that is a major concern but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now. Hard to believe but true. This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so called Digital Telephony proposal according to rumours.

It gives us almost nothing of value threatens to take away a lot and does it with a sincere smile on its face and the nice friendly word Management. FACT SHEET PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT The first thing it doesn't say is We're giving you stronger encryption. what it says is the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key. Similarly it didn't say We're making encryption is commercially available. because encryption *is* already commercially available including forms the NSA may not be able to break like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money. The next thing it didn't say is We're making encryption legal because of course encryption *has always been* legal and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was: In making this decision I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this. Another thing it didn't say is We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping because of course there's a budget crisis and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was: The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications.  Further the Attorney General shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance means.) -- #				Pray for peace;      Bill # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ #	              No I'm *from* New Jersey I only *work* in cyberspace.... # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461"
"2","Interestingly enough in designing the escrow we may want to use some rather unusual technology such as sealed boxes of paper or destructive read memory rather than typical computer databases which is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys. The greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read. Of course then it's hard to backup.  However I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup. An audit trail that reveals when data has been access that *can't* be erased by the humans involved is also necessary. -- Brad Templeton ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale CA 408/296-0366"

No it's not acceptable if it's part of your login process. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of pseudo-random information do the right thing and pass it through a cryptographic hash function not a compressor. Aside from the fact that it will run faster it will give better results (think of a cryptographic hash as a function that distills randomness). Something along the lines of etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5 should do the trick. -t gives you timestamps and the lack of -u makes sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K.

"2","A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp. agrep 2.0.4 -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool source code project available from: cs.arizona.edu in directory agrep agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the similarity of matches in the data. For example say you make up a password/phrase of qimwe7l. Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some crack program to brute-force search for it? You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none one or two errors no matches.  Good so far.  But agrep -3 qimwe7l bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern qimwe7l is too close to the pattern imsel (part of himself and a host of others) to be of any cryptographic value as a key. An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like teh for the.  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.) And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example For example say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book Neuromancer in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of 1 I will find all those people who think the title was Necromancer or other common typos.  Why miss anything? Also the program can look for up to 30000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name terrorists names special Tagalog or religious words etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories. You can even search for ciphertext by using say 30000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y. You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA National Security Agency NSecAg No Such Agency National Scrabble Association N*S*A etc. You can also specify fixed areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct you might say: agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition substitution deletion) in the number area.  You can also weight the relative cost for substiutions additions or deletion errors.  For example when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination you might know that some kinds of damage cause the A nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c errors. A steganographic use (I even used agrep -2 <steg>eograp E just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext... Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the hits into a useful form.  For example agrep -d ^From 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)' says output the entire mail record delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase' 'Zimmerman' or 'NSA'. And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.

"2","I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter I've created alt.privacy.clipper since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now. I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly if you're not an absolutist your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one repository is shall we say overly pliable a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect the subkeys even more. Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter they could do that only with session keys and have no back door at all.  In that case the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''. We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap but with a digitally-signed record of the time phone number etc of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant. I can suggest other variations too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long. I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too.  (I've heard rumors over the years that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door. The cryptographic protocol though is another matter.  I see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there are a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad."
"2","This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything evil in and of itself but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom democracy and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks. The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things: 1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time and it only just now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time. 2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time but wasn't able to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the administration felt that even escrowed secret-algorithm and for all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be made widely available.)

The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this but it's hard to say. The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know? I'm guessing symmetric but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?) If it's asymmetric what about PKP's patents which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

From the limited details released so far It seems that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in their data base? This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S. As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible. Bill Smythe"

I disagree if for no other reason than that there are already other standards in place.  Besides even if they restrict encryption on the NREN who cares?  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway.

So I am posting it here so others can read it check it out and comment on it and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things. I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article but if accurate I find it extremely disturbing especially in light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy (I understand it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license or to register a car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards wiretap proposals and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs any possible benefits IMO. BTW reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been promoting in an even more disturbing form. That said with no further comment the article follows: ------------ Begin included article --------- Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717. --------------------------------------------------- THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                           April 16 1993 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key-escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system) the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: --   the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens; --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (information superhighways) will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A:   No.  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message? A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is? A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product? A:   The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry? A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q:   Who provides the Clipper Chip? A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices. Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.  There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition.  Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques. Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware? A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products. ----------- End included article ----------- -- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle WA If all else fails try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat WISDOM: Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about the former.              - Albert Einstien"

Umm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''. The SDNS protocols for example make explicit provision for multiple encryption systems as does PEM.  (And I'd love to see how they'd mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....) Mind you I'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them which certainly casts doubt on your choice of words."
"2","Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business or professional body in a position to establish a standard and provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission systems. RSA might be in position to do it if they had active cooperation of a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones. Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out because they all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them. If we as professionals in crypto organizations EFF etc. were to put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a crypto standard for transmission and getting our companies to implement it we might avoid government control. Otherwise I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They are strong enough and we may be foolish enough to push through the Clipper Chip. Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I for one would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones. If not this we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented in either SW or HW and publish it then push to make it the defacto standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.

I for one : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones. Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard and it will become the market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed etc.) (There are also unclear issues about how hard or how illegal it will be to make workalikes which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.) Meanwhile I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much at $125 or so and the general issue of software patents...) we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid say $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002 or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much I'm sure the actual terms could be different spread out over several years whatever. To me it's a small price to pay.) Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys sending copies of keys to large databases and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms is *NOT* strong crypto! Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said potential...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months). The RSA algorithms are at least public have been analyzed and attacked for years and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors). I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system. Of course we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists child pornographers and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.) I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of MailSafe!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

"2","One presumes the system could work as follows: a) Blank clips are manufactured by Mykotronx and VLSI.  The number produced is carefully audited and they are shipped to the first escrow house. It programs the chips with its half the key and prints out a paper slip with the key half and non-secret chip serial number.   The reams of paper are filed in locked boxes in the vault a fuse is burnt in the chip so that the key is now unreadable. The chip then goes to the next escrow house where the same thing is done.  This continues through N escrow houses perhaps could be more than 2. The last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker. And yes this has to be a public key system or it would be almost impossible to handle.  It might not be RSA but that does not mean that PKP doesn't get paid.

I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.) My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble. Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the Clipper system is easily justified Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever. How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair be it for drug dealing or whatever would just buy still available non-clipper systems. Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato. Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.

I really wonder. To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton: The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461 April 17 1993 Sir and/or Madam: I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life. It is apparent to me that those who drafted the Clipper Chip Proposal (which is incidentally gaining notoriety as the Big Brother Proposal) are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destined for standardization is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from experts without full disclosure is plain ignorance. In addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such as DES when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrows might be. I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the Clipper Chip Proposal knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti lize the Big Brother Chip. Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like harmony right to encryption and voluntary. It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is I can't believe it's happening here.

They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption. I probably shouldn't say this but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

I don't know but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone. Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption. How could the back door keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key or some such. Another possibility as was suggested here earlier is that the chips simply broadcast the session key encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.) Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a dual key property that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip. It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.

"2","In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals I'd love to see a UNIX-based encryption scheme that: 1) Kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say all the files in your home directory) 2) Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a modem line. It seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not among other things. I'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system. Does such a system exist?  If it were made easy-to-use and readily available I think it would be a Good Thing(tm).

What follows is my opinion. It is not asserted to be the truth so no flames please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies. I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and governments to break. I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about the bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms). I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure. I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese. This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the Sun OpenWindows 3 mailtool which handles (non-MIME) attachments and the like. Since I don't use mailtool I had to manually save it cut & paste and then uudecode the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message. If he had sent me the sentence in plain text the e-mail would have been around 250 bytes and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at most.  Instead it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of (my) time and bandwidth as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still the most efficient method of transmission given the same transport mechanism. I shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their Usenet articles as audio files instead of plain text!  Meltdown of the Net predicted! Film at Eleven! Back to Mono!

"2","The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all. But lets ignore that for the moment. The fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using encryption? Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as Public Keys) can the government stop me from using an encryption process? If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers (depending upon which causes more damage and to whom). However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please who cares about the clipper chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line is insecure PERIOD. I don't care if they encrypt it 10 ways from sunday if I didn't do the encrypting I don't trust it. This is the attitude that everyone else should have. Instead of worrying about a clipper chip simply connect your handset to your computer and feed the voice single through process encrypt and transmit over the phone. The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse. Can't work you say? No Standard you say? Obviously you have never uses PGP. Anyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is kidding themselves. Only you can protect your own freedoms. One final thought addressed to EFF: 1.Do you support the implementation of ANY form of encryption where the encryption key must be revealed? 2.If you do why? If not why? 3.What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either support or stop this proposal? 4.If you do not support this proposal what alternatives do you offer?

"2","It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them too. OK suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant just like the old days.  But unlike the old days they now need to (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of the key. Now what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics while potentially good leads disappear lives and property are lost statutes of limitations run out etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?] There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with and it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government with a databank of the necessary size and data traffic of the projected volume there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of these kinds of problems will be open for public or expert scrutiny?] Furthermore the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a key resulting in lawsuits financial settlements and political embarassment.  So the Feds implement it this way: (b) some federal agency gets the keys performs the tap and turns the results over to the NY State Police. But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now not only do we have the keys as a political chit we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again the State Police lose. I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain.

Following precedent in other areas the government is likely to put a tax on encryption technology.  Once the tax is imposed it becomes a federal matter and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or FBI tossing grenades into your house.  (The BATF appears to be the logical agency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol tobacco and firearms is similary based on taxes.) Look at the FCC: they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive bands that are supposed to be private.  This has nothing to do with any desire to prevent harmful interference.

I am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things seem evident to me things which this Clinton Clipper do not address. The all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory it almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority and remember power DOES corrupt. I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop using Clipper as a precident). There was a hint of that in the proposal remember.  That said please bear with me I am not very articulate so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you. >Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The >telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule >today. As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen if this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in several other areas it is certain to be used here.  Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable and Clinton and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through).  How come those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders?  They cannot quietely IMPLIMENT it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone. Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust past or future?  To be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE not 'unlikely' or 'difficult'. >But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the >judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext >without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain >cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to >listen to those tapes? can they? So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved after the last case was finished) or other means (master key backdoor easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which given to a judge would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the Feds have a workaround somehow BET on it.  Does anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key'?  I sure don't. This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past eavesdropping was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights that puts people first.  The question is put people first to WHERE? With the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there DOESN'T exist a 'master key' for use by NSA etc (so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific court order)?   Remember the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY. Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After awhile they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down didn't it? And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance! I see one ending up being under say Treasury the other under Justice :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important concern but given past government behavior and the other problems... >>worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper >>to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption.

It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the argumet well if you got nothing to hide...  Fine. Then using that argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government safeguards are pretty meaningless if they want to do/get something. Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish bad precidents please.  The price could be hell to pay later. >This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would >fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so >called Digital Telephony proposal according to rumours.  However the >meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext >on telco systems and that requires a bit of work. People would fight laws forbidding more NOW but in say two years because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some 'drastic action' just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it. If the Clinton Clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version (with a 'master key' provision) or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there... :-) And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known? I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret... Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure but good enough for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full description (not a PR non-statement) of just what good enough means? I think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not very.  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution (which the people not the governments of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause' instead we should be trying to repair the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes but too many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one.  A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having too many rights (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime etc). BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton believe this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the Constitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any if it isn't too late allready. >-- >Brad Templeton ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale CA 408/296-0366 -- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle WA If all else fails try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat WISDOM: Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about the former.              - Albert Einstien"

"2","I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details on how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The implications of some details are fascinating. ------- Date: Sat 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From: Martin Hellman <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: (a long list of recipients) Subject: Clipper Chip Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) announcing the Clipper Chip crypto device. Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details. I was told the info was public so here it is (the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know if I have anything wrong): The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in Silicon. Each chip will have two secret 80-bit keys. One will be the same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them but I will call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. When a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and K2 thereby allowing access to the unit key UK. In addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E{ E[M; K] E[K; UK] serial number;  SK} When a court order obtains K1 and K2 and thence K the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to E[M; K] E[K; UK] serial number in the above message. They then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which they have a court order. If so they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M. I am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority. While no explanation is needed the following story adds some color: In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around I spoke with Gerald Gunther the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story: When Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right after Watergate) he was visited by an FBI agent asking for the wiretap authorizations. When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear: No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps (or worse yet divulging of personal keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell. Martin Hellman ---- Date: Sun 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT From: Martin Hellman <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: smb@research.att.com Subject: Re: Clipper Chip It is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt if you also post this message with it in which: 1. I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions. By this posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to respond to. (I already spend too much time answering too much e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities.) 2. I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning. She met with the person from NSA that I talked with by phone so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point: Where I said the transmitted info is  E{ E[M; K] E[K; UK] serial number;  SK} she says the message is not double encrypted. The system key (or family key as she was told it is called) only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key. This is not a major difference but I thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention. It makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead."

As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government. Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum which is after all a drug. Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow and the FBI gets their pet wiretap without leaving the office scheme. There is a coup which happens every day all around the world. Within hours everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible. Without the tools being in place a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed. Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith. >>-Tim May whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime >                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >	Isn't this just a little melodramatic? I'm a political dissident. As such I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world. All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it? If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick. Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny. I for one am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere. -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire laissez passer. Le monde va de lui meme."

"2","Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says: There is a global key G plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three keys: G its own U_C and the user's K_P. The government as a whole knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P)C)  E_{K_P}(M). That's it. The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M the receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C. The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key escrow'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted? ---Dan"

Just for the hell of it let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing or telling. Now what?

The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.

Just about the only circumstances in which I could think that they would be interested in their political views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force lets try thinking. In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls he was chief spook remember. Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply ask their chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be nice boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms. Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed?

"2","There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip. The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them. A Mr. Deely an NSA official said There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group. For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers. Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved. For example in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local law-enforcement people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high. The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing probable cause) is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right. I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality. I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression. To most of the American public the word hacker has rightly or wrongly come to mean high tech adolescent vandal. It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act. The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years maybe NSA should evaluate another approach. EFF who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved. Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more. And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela vous concerne cheri?"
"2","I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked--how does the Clipper chip exchange keys?  If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key size?  (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal with p set to a constant value?) Presumably the real scheme is something like: 1.  Exchange/verify public keys. 2.  Send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key. 3.

If the other party can decrypt it doesn't that mean that someone else could also?

This seems like a fundamental question to me but I have very little experience with cryptosystems other than DES.

"2","Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991. Possible actions to take in response: 1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list and more. 2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist even if you are one. 3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides. 4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues. 4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying. 5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it. 6)  Publicize deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP PGP key servers etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes. 7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan and articulate how we want it modified. -Philip Zimmermann"

Many file formats can be written with gaps in them to hide other data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden by dispersing it amongst the legitimate data.  The hidden data would only show up with the right key(s) and a file with hidden data would be indistinguishable from one without.  So only the correct key(s) would reveal the presence of an illegal document. If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have the uncompressor and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish do I have the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to escrow all our data file formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals colors and catch phrases?

I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now. The problem is that with any security scheme of this kind you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine. As originally described it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that for (say) $100000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES for all the complaints about a 56-bit key would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.) How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan Chrysler or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? Gee Mr Jones I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help... >>I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some >>Swiss or anybody Japanese. Indeed if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However the system as a whole isn't resistant to practical cryptanalysis.  In _The Puzzle Palace_ Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.

The algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar government equivalent to military) has been let for this proprietary design that the Feds say that NSA developed.

Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security there must be some sort of key exchange either using a public-key encryption scheme or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call. Now it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere right?  So probably there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme of course.)  Presumably if you don't use your designated key you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips. It might be useful to have a modified chip which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair or some other key pair and verification scheme.  Unfortunately this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communications.... --John Kelsey >I hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first >ones are released..."

"2","Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative. For example how about a scheme using RSA and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip except that instead of key-registration the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent and assuming you've committed no crimes you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?). This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals but it couldn't be done in secrecy and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys. (Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct me but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement capabilities.) Any comments? --John Kelsey"

Anyway I think it would be a great idea to develop such a product perhaps in the underground as it would otherwise probably become illegal pretty quickly here... It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream and an RS232 on the other side. You'd plug your phone into it plug the RS232 into your computer and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream. With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream it should work. Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone. At the very highest price you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't). The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics I'm afraid. However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking] G"

Mr. Read said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that as soon as his feet touch the water he will leap away.

It's not surprising at all but not because of the reason you give. It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of money behind this program and it will support it.

Agreed. No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public release of a crypto-system if they didn't already have the technical means or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the whole point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her communications will be kept safe while James Bond at the NSA can if need be have full decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll be quite a heist if they can pull it off. I thought that the US Government were going to release the algorithm to a panel of carefully chosen experts who would then study it deeply and report their findings? Exactly who will these people be?

That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure (and I mean secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (if? Ha! optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes on the former (almost nobody) - which is clearly an improvement - and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter (guaranteed). Yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen?

"2","Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note courtesy of Dorothy Denning.  Again this is reposted with permission. Two requests -- first note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such that neither can be produced alone.  Thus the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key and another generates the second.  *That* is ominous. Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture nor are they carefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden meanings (as opposed to say the official announcements of Clipper). Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read I don't think you can impugn his integrity. Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.  If you think something doesn't make sense it's almost certainly because you don't understand their goals. --Steve Bellovin ----- Date: Sun 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT From: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip To: (a long list of folks) I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI so let me add a few comments to Marty's message: The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 in DES. In addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method (e.g. public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the AT&T telephone security devices which will have the new chip the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol. encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E{ E[M; K] E[K; UK] serial number;  SK} My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the family key) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I will also check it out but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait. The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the serial number N as follows.  Let N1 N2 and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.

Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions. Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's criteria I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions I've received so far include SRI Rand Mitre the national labs (Sandia LANL Los Alamos) Treasury GAO. When a court order obtains K1 and K2 and thence K the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow.] My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box which will have been keyed with K. for the wiretap authorizations. When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear: No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps No single person does at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound of paperwork an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the Attorney General for final approval.

Instead of reading between the lines try to think a little bit. OK if that's way too difficult to you here are some hints. Indeed the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on the local police if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie that your mom is telling you on the phone. So guess what they will do? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some facilitations?

"2","Misinterpretation though it should be a crime in itself is what United States lawyers use to make their bread and butter. In Manchester CT a few years ago a small company wanted to run a game system galled LaserGames similar in many aspects to Photon (tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these things was shooting galleries which is what the lawyers for the opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two words from this law completely out of context and ruled that LaserGames could not operate in Manchester. Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in their shooting galleries and not light beams. Clearly from context LaserGames got shafted but if the two words are applied their denial of operating permission was justified. If I had the text of the law I'd post it but I'm afraid I don't remember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the two words stuck well though. :	John Dormer :	jad@expert.cc.purdue.edu"
"2","I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems. The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z contains 77 pages and can be retrieved from ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180) from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters. ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem called the representation problem of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously. Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem. Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore the basic cash system can be extended to checks multi-show cash and divisibility while retaining its computational efficiency. ==================================================================== Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system! I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless if you have any questions please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can.

That would make most people happy and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange the official chips would only work with other official chips.  In other words secrecy of SK makes physically identical clone versions impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be necessary. Of course revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK --- since all units share this key compromising it may be a big deal. Personally I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one secret 80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security. Of course compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system is compromised but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true with a secret algorithm. Incidentally what's to keep a secret algorithm from using the secret SK as the main key with UK being only marginally important.

I understand believe it or not and there are any number of kinds of conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider using this scheme for.  On the other hand I don't see Clipper as providing a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler nothing more. There is still plenty of market for real crypto. > As for its better than the status quo well first of all you can > get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today -- and they work > well.

Example: We're a networking software vendor with a large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM or even simple DES in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to compete in international information systems markets. Sure you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in the USA.  I on the other hand want strong crypto (PKCS for example) to be the *default* for electronic mail worldwide.  I want priests to be able to hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in confidence over email or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I want to be able to sign contracts transact business and so on electronically. This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on crytographic systems especially beyond the borders of the USA. Clipper is irrelevant and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put more restrictions into place on the theory that it is good enough for anyone who has nothing to hide.

"2","( Below is my response to Dr. Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments are invited. - Paul ) In alt.privacy.clipper Steve Bellovin posted your message to him which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies as escrow agencies. I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue however that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all. As a private citizen I would feel much more secure in my person and papers knowing that an organization committed to individual civil liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported funded or overtly controlled by the government. Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned I have the following comments: - SRI Rand Mitre and national labs: I agree that they have great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_ information since in any case requiring disclosure there's likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly *wrongful* disclosure. - GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of their fidelity and ability. - *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a better choice. Ever since last fall's trial balloon was posted in sci.crypt your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law. I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always* act properly. However there have been enough cases where _sworn agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper. The name of the encryption algorithm is Skipjack. Martin Hellman had written and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E{ E[M; K] E[K; UK] serial number;  SK} To which I responded: My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the family key) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this? I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However Skipjack being a single-key system there is of course not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK. The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the serial number N as follows.  Let N1 N2 and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys. Compute the 64-bit block R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1 R2 and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded. The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire programming session to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired). The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1 N2 and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value). The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

"2","If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves I would not trust Mitre either.  Mitre does lots of work for NSA at least in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information) and I assume in other less open programs. There are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and Development Corporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for Defense Analysis.  Now if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that I am neutral about for purposes of this posting) it would be in a position to exert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand.  It could just say If you don't cooperate with us we'll place all our evaluation contracts with Aerospace and IDA. I am not saying that people at NSA Mitre Aerospace or IDA are dishonest folk.  But since they are people and people occasionally go bad the system works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be independent really are.

"2","Hmm followup on my own posting... Well who cares. First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us: The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is) the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever* and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's) and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2] serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper. Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated using a seed of 160 Bit's. Now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ]  there are some weak points in this scheme which might be exploited by several parties. As far as I know about the generation of K1K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true random-sources for the generation of the K1K2 can be bought for not to much money. Then the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each which have to be xored together to give the K1K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution but I guess politics will not work that way. Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there I have no idea who is allowed to tap and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis! What do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ECB mode and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^) And now a last point for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages which shold not be overseen! Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am talking about!!!

Instead it looks like that >ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment. I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed. Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property. It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more. WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take responsibility for ourselves our personal welfare and our actions. __  Paul J.

Note the use of the word business in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only business use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it and revealing or often selling the info. These people are of course in this proposal the people who will have the keys. The criminals also use lawers courts the CIA white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard yet of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side abuse by law enforcers is well documented even by govt agencies.

Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word ensure.

I can hardly imagine what the result would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported this plan instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton administration either but the Clinton administration has embraced it and brought it to fruition. Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy and even seem to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two you're supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their histories) regardless of whether you personally support that reduction.

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...) Basic Scenario: I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal private keys during the authentication sequence. Questions: Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any information useful for a search give me any protection as far as being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..) It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am assisting in entrapment (the users would send thier key anyway and are not being enticed into doing something they would not otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used? Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval? Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated... jim -- Jim McCoy                |  UT Unix Sysadmin Tiger Team mccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  #include <disclaimer.h> j-mccoy@nwu.edu          |  pgp key available via finger or upon request"

"2","In previous postings by Hellman Bellovin etal it was reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in 64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be derived from RSA Diffy-Hellman etc. is used to encrypt plaintext M and is then used to form a three part message. This three part message consists of E[M; K] K encrypted with some other key and the chip serial number.  This three part message is then encrypted by still another key. My question is: What is a message? For example say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure communications link. Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the session? If the header is sent at the beginning of the session how do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip? Is a facility clearance required to manufacture? Any ideas?"

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another Richard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant future acutally).  With that in mind then I take it you also would not object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just like Clinton Cripple is a decision not a proposal) sprung on us to start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house which could be activated without your knowlege.  They would be well concealed so you wouldn't know the location to prevent you from covering the lens opening.  After all nothing you're doing would be of the slightest interest to a government official right?  So you surely should not object to such a proposal... Not the best anology but the principle is pretty close - the ability to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort without your knowlege protected by entirely by government safeguards.  You can still draw your curtains so you can still have your privacy from everyone else (except Big Brother)!!  After all we need this for protection from drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the STATE')... and you don't really have a right to unbreakable privacy anyway sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION puts it... I find it curious they use the word unbreakable when the term really should be difficult to break without proper authorization (which the Government most certainly has at their disposal right?  They wouldn't want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY would they?)...  Nawww not for the People Clinton.... Can you while my mind is on it give us one good reason that the algorithm should be a secret algorithm unless this encryption scheme either is a joke or contains features like a 'master key' or other back door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was really even moderately secure and the government really meant to require the proper court order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher the traffic what is the need to keep the algorithm secret?  Seems I hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm to remain a secret to be effective it is not a worthwhile scheme... is this just idle talk or is the Administration bullshitting everyone? With GREAT skepticism and many doubts on our Administrations intentions... And WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in mind for e-mail and datafile security.  The press release does say that this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged citizens.  Perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term - 'citizens' somehow does not seem appropriate... that implies a free people 'subjects' better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers.

You can use anything you want > RIGHT NOW. The point is to maintain that right. The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone scrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally my MP has responded to my questions on that issue and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption and `dodgy' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station. The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end but cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls the transmission is decrypted at the base-station passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant. But maybe the Clipper system is secure and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well Judge it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all so naturally we'll stop listening in'...

"2","I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies the chip is so much garbage and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys. If I were to manufacture such a chip as part of my marketing strategy I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact. (doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative. I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative. I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community but lots of money. I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal. I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.

Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the door but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment. Perhaps that worked in California in the 60's but as I understand the law landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space rented by a third party provided the lease is not in default etc. (I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key when shown a search warrant since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified). At this point the question becomes: did the user rent the disk space her encrypted file occupies?  If she did it _should_ fall under the same body of case law that applies to apartments storage lockers etc.  (As to whether any court would recognize this fact....)

"2","The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications. Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16. The document below is the result of that effort. Dorothy Denning --------------- THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning April 19 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16 the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the Clipper Chip together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key. CHIP STRUCTURE The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called Skipjack.  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second. Each chip includes the following components: the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30-bit serial number U an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e. digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values: E[M; K] the encrypted message stream and E[E[K; U] + N; F] a law enforcement block. The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family key F. CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility) which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx. At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers. To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 producing a 64-bit block R1: R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . Similarly N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed: R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies. As a sequence of values for U1 U2 and U are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind. The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies. The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the NSA CIA FBI or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government. LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on information provided by NSA NIST and the FBI.  Permission to distribute this document is granted."
"2","I would think that you could reduce the defense of using non-clipper based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression (IE free speech).  That you have to right to express whatever you want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do not impinge on the rights of others. Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that particular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another means of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of continuous waveforms. Also it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  Encryption _Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations (apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked with ISO and the Metric System SAE etc.  Independent entities or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far more qualified to set standards than any One government agency. Consider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked like if it was decided by the government. I hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses.

"2","Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption. Currently when you send an encrypted message an opponent can usually tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you are using [because that information is usually in the clear]. With clipper most opponents will only know that you are sending clipper-text they won't know that your clipper-text is itself encoded. Only those few opponents who get your clipper-keys will know that your message is double encrypted. ... kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box.

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate you can bet that the Administration will have made it very clear to the vendors that it would very much be in their best interests to institute a voluntary policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment to anyone other than Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement or individuals and corporations who have been been determined by the Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis for an effective system. Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control bills/laws the Administration is pushing for or otherwise supporting. The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases only the items or technology in question are different. I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people not the people controlling the government that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... we know best....

Ok so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the conventional key and the serial number and encrypted conventional key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus as the whole concept of one key that millions of people use which can't be changed doesn't seem reasonable) family key. Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line. Mind you I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme so the decryption chip sees the restored proper bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong? I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip sends that information out many times in slightly different ways making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent. -- Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted If your theory predicts different outcomes depending on whether you use discrete mathematics or continuous mathematics then you've got the wrong theory.		- Bruce MacLennan"

"2","Here is a disturbing thought. Now we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen but thats naive.) Well lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact I believe the serial number is smaller but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes. Admittely they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point with or without collusion by the agencies those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that can't is a prayer not a word that in this instance connotes realism. With two exabyte tapes in your pocket you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah you need the master key two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places. Come to think of it even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views consider foreign intelligence services. You know the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.) Presumably foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing. Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases. We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips. I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever but they can try to delay things as long as possible. Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization really do believe that this scheme might give people some security even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all. -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire laissez passer.

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that the people is a term of art refering to an individual right and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example. I quote: ... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the Constitution is ordained and established by 'the people of the the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people to keep and bear Arms .... - Supreme Court of the U.S.  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990). Furthermore in the Miller decision they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However that does not change the interpretation. Furthermore it appears that others disagree with you as well vis: The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history concept and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi- cation indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner. - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate 97th Congress Second Session ( February 1982 ) You might rightfully ask well then what does that first bit about militias mean? Well militia in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed the U.S. Code still defines militia as all armed men over the age of 17). The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time. - Supreme Court of the United States  U.S. v. Miller (1939). The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people rather than the other way around. No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government. - Thomas Jefferson Proposal Virginia Constitution June 1776 1 Thomas Jefferson Papers 334 (C. J. Boyd Ed. 1950). And what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith 1787 in Jefferson On Democracy 20 S. Padover ed. 1939). Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the United States. - Noah Webster An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford 1888). You may disagree with the second amendment and wish that it be repealed but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have changed and that it should no longer be present but you can't imagine it away. I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already. However none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get it out of here.

If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors. Indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good system right now. A standard codec chip a chip to do vocoding a DES chip a V32bis integrated modem module and a small processor to do glue work are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they can be. Yes cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government. You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying this is good because it gives people privacy note that we didn't need them to give us privacy the capability is available using commercial hardware right now. Indeed were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for the NSA and company cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it is they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for them I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now. They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a clipper chip what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize for having traded in your birthright. And what did we buy with our birthright?

Simple -- if you have a choice between: 1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy behavoir or 2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under the control of the user which would you choose?

A thirty bit serial number. And we are told the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys. To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 producing a 64-bit block R1: R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . Similarly N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed: R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies. Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1 S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective master keys (along with F) the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However more interestingly we know for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door? I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin. Even if S1 and S2 change periodically the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security. If S1 and S2 do not change even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and soon foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late. As a sequence of values for U1 U2 and U are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind. None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of destroying the laptop appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth doing this in a vault rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us. The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies. What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them. -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire laissez passer.

I don't know how many folks noticed it but Dorothy Trust Me Denning gave a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when she said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any part of the key. Now why is that?  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack.  (But we will never know).  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they couldn't compromise.  Ergo NSA is now capable of compromising (probably with brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of Skipjack.  Look at the specs.

Hmm here are a couple: 1) If the algorithm becomes known it will be easy to produce pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and privacy because their keys are only in their users' hands. 2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher it needs some way to agree on a session key. The released information says that any protocol may be used (e.g. DH). From a theoretical point of view this is probably true. However from a practical point of view those chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if it is good old RSA?

"2","[Apologies for not posting to alt.clipper or whatever but it seems it may not be in the newsfeed here.] There may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view horrible from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret. First note that the experts will only look at details and of just the algorithm: In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. Why not the chip design?  Well here's the possiblity:  in addition to encryption the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip once widespread might effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for voice- grepping the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons thereof). I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life for them. And if this is indeed the case think of the possible public outcry should it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity: ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16 1993 Washington DC COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced Public Encryption Management initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA) the super- secret military intelligence agency had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built. According to NIST the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies including NSA NIST the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards. CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called digital signature standard (DSS) a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had in fact developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS. David Sobel CPSR Legal Counsel called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications as reflected in today's official statement  a step in the right direction.  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process. CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

"2","This is the file BIGNUMS.TXT from ripem.msu.edu last updated April 1993. In response to Email requests I have assembled this list of large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard. Most of these are C function libraries available in source form. For your convenience I have placed copies of some of these on ripem.msu.edu (35.8.1.178).  They are available for anonymous FTP in the directory pub/bignum. However what I have may not be the most current version in all cases. Here they are in no particular order: mp Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your compiler.  Provides + - * / gcd exponentiation sqrt.  Comes with SunOS NeXT Mach BBN Mach 1000 and probably a few others.  See man mp. Object code only of course. PARI Henri Cohen et al. Universite Bordeaux I Paris FRANCE Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines. Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020 semi-optimized code for SPARC and apparently rather slow generic C version.  Does both integers and reals. Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars. Contains a number of advanced functions some of which I've never heard of.  (Weber's function?) Has a factorization function primality test & other related stuff. Plenty of TEX documentation. Public domain but you can't distribute modified versions. Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu.  There seem to be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to: Filename:  pari-1.35a.tar.Z Arithmetic in Global Fields  (Arith) Kevin R. Coombes David R. Grant Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or polynomials over finite fields.  Includes basic + - * / and a few others like gcd.  Source code in C. Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license. Includes man pages and TEX documentation. Filename:  arith.tar.Z Arbitrary Precision Math Library Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos CA C package which supports basic + - * /.  Provides for radix points (i.e. non-integers).  Not as polished as the others here. Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988. Filename:  apml.tar.Z BigNum J. Vuillemin INRIA FRANCE and others. Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL) A portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer package. C code with generic C kernel plus assembly kernels for MC680x0 Intel i960 MIPS NS32032 Pyramid and of course VAX. This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type. Implements + - * / mod plus logical operations OR AND XOR. Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available. Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com. You will receive 5 shell archives.  Give your postal address and you will also receive printed documentation from France. Package includes TEX documentation. Publicly available for non-commercial use. I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL doesn't like others to distribute it.  However BIGNUM *is* distributed as part of ecpp (see below). Lenstra's package Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C. Includes + - * / exponentiation mod primality testing sqrt random number generator and a few others.  The package was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I have actually used.  It works well and is very portable. I haven't done any benchmarks against the others but the code looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist. Unlike the other packages here this one requires you to allocate storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge. Arjen has placed the code in the public domain. Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z lenstra_3.1 Arjen Lenstra  Bellcore An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned off as an option). Has a few new routines too.  lenstra_3.1 contains minor bugfixes to the previously-available lenstra_2 and lenstra_3. Filename:  lenstra_3.1.c bmp  (Brent's Multiple Precision?) R. P. Brent 1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating & fixed point arithmetic.  Includes most of the mathematical functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library. This code is an ACM algorithm number 524. To obtain send a mail message to  netlib@ornl.gov containing the line send mp.f from bmp or better yet perhaps just start with help. SPX Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo DEC This is a huge prototype public key authentication system based on RSA.  I mention it here because those who have heard of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France. You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2). Use it only for testing as it may expire on a certain date. (I don't know whether this has expired yet.) amp  (Antti's Multiple Precision?) Antti Louko   alo@kampi.hut.fi Multiple precision integer package in C.  Includes + - * / % pow mod 1/x mod y random sqrt gcd.  Available for non-commercial use.  The package includes share-secret a public key system based on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. This is normally part of the well-known des-dist.tar.Z but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with cryptographic export laws and have named the result: Filename:  amp.tar.Z gennum Per Bothner   U of Wisconsin-Madison C++ routines and classes to do generic arithmetic both integer and rational. Formerly available on sevenlayer.cs.wis.edu.  However it seems to have disappeared.  Sorry. MIRACL (By someone in Dublin Ireland) Integer and fractional multiple precision package.

(See ads in Byte Magazine or Dr. Dobbs.) precision Dave Barrett  barrettd@tigger.colorado.edu Multiple precision integer package in C with +-*/ sqrt rand mod pow log.  Simple vector support.  Does dynamic allocation of memory. Free as long as you don't sell it or any program that uses it. Filename:  precision.tar.Z UBASIC Prof. Yuji Kida Rikkyo University Nishi-Ikebukuro 3 Tokyo 171 Japan kida@rkmath.rikkyo.ac.jp Multiple-precision version of the BASIC programming language for MS-DOS.  Includes floating point.  Said (by Keith Briggs) to be pretty fast.  Object only I think.  ervin@morekypr.bitnet says:  This is the best package that I know of for fast arithmetic.  Has a version optimized for 386 machines.  Includes routines to do MPQS the fastest currently known general factoring algorithm.  An additional file is at both sites to allow MPQS to use hard drives so that it can factor up to 80 digits.  Many number theoretical functions are included in UBASIC.  It allows over 2500 digits of precision. Available via anonymous FTP from shape.mps.ohio-state.edu or simtel20.army.mil or wuarchive.wustl.edu. calc_v22 Unknown MS-DOS C-like language that allows infinite precision. Nice intrinsic functions.  ervin@morekypr.bitnet reports problems when changing precision on the fly. See simtel20 or wuarchive. briggs_arith Keith Briggs (kbriggs@mundoe.maths.mu.oz.au) Turbo Pascal 5 source for routines that do multiple-precision + - * / sqrt gcd factoring rand for integers; also includes + - * / and rand for rational numbers.

Filename: bignum-1.2 GNU Multiple Precision GNU (Free Software Foundation) multiple precision package. I haven't looked at it yet.  This is current as of April 1992 but there may be a more recent version by the time you read this.  This package is very widely available on FTP sites.

"2","Secrecy in Clipper Chip The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message. Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else differential analysis). Postulate if you will a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold: 1) Transmit Channel The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the system key 2) Recieve Channel The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number is necessary for local operation). This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key you could lie about the serial number but risk detection of the lie. IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number. Makes you wonder whats being hidden here?   Seems  like the secrecy is to prevent you from lying about who you are."
"2","What are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms? I know DES is 56 bits (tripple DES is 112 bits) and IDEA is 128 bits.  Is there anything made in the US that has 128 bit keys?  Anything anywhere that has larger keys?  I've heard that RC2 can be scaled to arbitrarily large keys but is this actually implemented anywhere? Finally can anyone even concieve of a time/place where 128 bit keys aren't sufficient?

So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town? Note: I think Cylink is great and if my boss would double my salary I'd buy a bunch of their stuff :). One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems. This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme and easier to deploy.  This is of course either a bug or a feature depending on how you look at it :). > Indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good > system right now.

"2","If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created. Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed. Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means. Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars) it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments. Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies. In other words Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and persistent threat to the general public. On the other hand if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network the communication will at least stand out as being unusual and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation. Finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse. Brad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet pyramid}!optilink!brad Petaluma CA"

In order for the applicable law enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from escrow the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text as part of the link establishment protocol. Whoever owns the program that assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key depository. In other words the FBI may need a court-ordered release of escrowed keys but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured. There is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys. While relations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained there is also a long history of trading favors. This will re-establish the NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without court orders.

"2","Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal how much of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over $1000 as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture Clipper seems to be more of the same rather than a new direction. Yes technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote more widespread use- but at present the man on the street is not going to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone especially when the guy on the other end probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something? The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air- tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.

Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy? All they know is that the keys are not enough but not why. 2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series. (This part is really scary.  Since the expectation is that all chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and S2 and the serial number getting the keys for one of a batch may give access to all.) 3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one of these phones presumably there will be an automatically negotiated key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the conversation to know what was said I use it as a known plaintext to recover the backdoor represented by the header but I know what the header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse if the phones in a series have related keys I can buy a phone/chip from the same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys either elegantly by talking to myself or by brute force analysis of the actual chip then apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target keys.) Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones. Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide much better security. -- Robert I.

Let's assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial 1 million chips.  That's 10^12 trials per second or about 38000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build a machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution. IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you? Hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at that speed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case for Skipjack too though there's no way of knowing just yet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's technology.  Modern chips can do a lot more. NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA (I doubt it for the former; I have no idea for the latter though it does seem to be a strong cryptosystem).  But it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search."

Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances are that the victim will not notice anything especially if it is done professionally. > Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate > with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from > key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means. No because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations. True they'll blame the wrong guys but nevertheless one cannot say something like The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus' when the Feds are listening even if they cannot identify who the speaker is. No the criminals will just use some secure encryption. The new proposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper. To me it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other strong encryption devices.

You see this country has this thing called a constitution.

"2","From: Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu> The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this but it's hard to say. I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption front end on it. There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely a digital chip.  The back end will come later but I'm *positive* it won't be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them. The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones. (Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true bwahahaha! ;-) ) G"

"2","One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things and with good reason. When I was a systems programmer it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize without doing the work to help fix the problem. Then I took a stint as an auditor and I found out the real reason. Auditors don't like to recommend solutions because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say Well you told us this way would be OK.  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job. Taking the case at hand suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that perhaps through some error on ACLU's part a key half gets away that shouldn't and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff which is not an easy position to be in. There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked when payroll checks were printed they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock) and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks. I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday and someone wants to do them again today he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest. As always my opinions are my own. Lynn Grant Grant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL"

"2","I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the proposed wiretap (or Clipper) chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation.  That is ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry and their customers to support this wiretap technology? A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology. Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for: - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware people etc. cost per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed law enforcement blocks? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year? Put another way the question I'm asking is what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?

As a commercial IP software vendor it really is my professional opinion that the NREN at this point is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had been deployed five years ago it would have been a major development.  Now however it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet and an attempt to revive the lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the NSFnet completely and the Internet would continue chugging along without a hiccup (aside from a few universities). Long-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be under federal sponsorship or regulation at least in the USA.  The success of the CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.  While our dear VP has been promoting his data superhighway the private sector has been building it without the NSFnet's restrictions.

"2","The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door. What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number? To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 producing a 64-bit block R1: R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . Similarly N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed: R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies. What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated. Or should I say the need to _access_ the Escrow houses to decrypt the data. The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion of protection and small-town cops won't be let in on the secret so they will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses but the fact is __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit keys from the encrypted serial number!__  'Nuff Said."

Actually I've been following her remarks for some time with interest. I'm also a member of academia and her remarks have nothing but elevate her respectability in my eyes.

While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order there is still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning only the FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer which seems to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level. The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political viewpoints. olson@umbc.edu"

I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles I've seen arguing for increased government intervention and management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually means more high paying jobs for academics as advisors).  Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way. Despicable yes; career limiting well the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be used against drug dealers child pornographers and terrorists well it must be good. :p -- Truth is hard to find and harder to obscure."

This assumes that the Feds are tapping Clipper phones belonging to ordinary citizens (getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under discussion).  To be sure I wouldn't put it past them -- but raising the possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the Feds to either 'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using Clipper exposes the user to an additional criminal threat. <g> > No the criminals will just use some secure encryption.

Second this isn't a problem of economics.  This is a problem of the incremental accumulation of police-state powers by our government. How exactly do you put a price on the loss of freedom of a society? Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people killed by the gov.  The pain and suffering cases for those tortured. The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy and all the secondary effects of diseases diet etc.  Plus the inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it becomes corrupt etc. Do us a favor.

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained. Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members potential terrorists radicals etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year. Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why wouldn't it happen? Ken Shirriff				shirriff@sprite.Berkeley.EDU"
"2","Read this through once or twice.  Then replace prince with government or president as appropriate and read it again. [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_ by N. Macchiavelli as translated by Daniel Donno.] In order to keep their lands secure some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow. To begin with there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed whenever he found them disarmed he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal while those who are already loyal remain so and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages. When you disarm your subjects however you offend them by showing that either from cowardliness or from lack of faith you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed you would have to resort to mercenaries whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good however they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies and doubtful subjects.  Therefore as I have said a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects and history is full of examples proving that this is so. But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these as time and occasion permit he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain. ... And since the subject demands it I will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the reason is not natural affection for him but rather dissatisfaction with the former government he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly for it will be impossible to please them.  If he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government and hence were his enemies than to keep the favor of those who out of dissatisfaction with the former rule helped him to replace it."

Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of work to be done in a straight brute-force attack where you try every single possible key until one works.  Processing and storage requirements for this kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively impossible.  However there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for example) proportional to say 2**sqrt(n) or some such.

[...] (the date I have for this is 1-26-93) note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..  I guess this statement doesen't contradict what you said though. --- cut here --- WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh start President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation of Police Commisioners convention in Washington. In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War ``would make everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical purposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasized his view that ``regardless of what has been tried or who has tried it or how long they've been trying it this is Day One to me.'' The audience at the convention whose theme is ``How do we spell fiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E'' interrupted Clinton frequently with applause. Clinton's program presented in the speech follows the outline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level Drug Czar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did however cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement methods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth not bare gums'' Clinton said.  In particular his administration will place strict controls on data formats and protocols and require the registration of so-called ``cryptographic keys'' in the hope of denying drug dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground economic activity such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.'' Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won ``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last November everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of urgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates of legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at making noise'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people cast their ballots it only proved what I knew all along -- that the advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''"

The original article has reappeared so: The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. Hmm telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on ordinary landlines. The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications links. OK it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will be applied to but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's misfortunes). Yes Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable as at present.  Nope I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio links. OK it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone lines' but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos. My apologies if I'm wrong particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it clear that I'm wrong and I missed it but as far as I can see it was full of obfuscation and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise (IMHO).

Read it again yourself then re-apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself as well.  The first clause is not a condition it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS MILITIA OR NOT that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution it is a right presumed to exist by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with block limit) that right.  Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.  All rights etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about). Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and you I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate. If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are some things in there that Big Brother types like Biden etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit. I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple Gun Control People Control and Control Control and the whole nasty mess. Please tell us how this person is in error won't you?

NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns --------- Begin included article ------- THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT by J. Neil Schulman If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang you'd ring up Carl Sagan right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ? That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of American Usage and Style: The Consensus. A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise. Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952 Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for Editor and Publisher a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field. He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage American Usage and Style: The Consensus has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981 and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award. That sounds like an expert to me. After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested I sent the following letter: I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and extract the intent from the text. The text of the Second Amendment is 'A well-regulated Militia being necessary for the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.' The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence 'A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State' is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.' I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary. My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment then concluded: I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because as a citizen I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results I ask that you do this because of that importance. After several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment gun control or any other political subject Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity): [Copperud:] The words 'A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26 1991 constitutes a present participle rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective modifying 'militia' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right' verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia. In reply to your numbered questions: [Schulman:] (1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'? [Copperud:] (1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people. [Schulman:] (2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'? [Copperud:] (2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia. [Schulman:] (3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free State and if that condition is not existing is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed' null and void? [Copperud:] (3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence. [Schulman:] (4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence? [Copperud:] (4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia. [Schulman:] (5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped' 'well-organized' 'well-drilled' 'well-educated' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'? [Copperud:] (5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military. [Schulman:] (6) (If at all possible I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written 200 years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated. [Copperud:] To the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today it might be put: Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.' [Schulman:] As a 'scientific control' on this analysis I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence A well-schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and read Books shall not be infringed.' My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be (1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and (2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example registered voters with a high-school diploma? [Copperud:] (1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure. (2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation. Professor Copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter: With well-known human curiosity I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion. So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right. As I write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power. And here in the United States elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Constitution. And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights stands by and does nothing. it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ? Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives our fortuned and our sacred honor ?

I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant. We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools' and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools' and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT. The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights privacy and overall freedom are concerned the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years. Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing. For example a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as. Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?) with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice? While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe if they have a legal cause they can get the keys from the suspect just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything get the warrants THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect. This Clinton Cripple along with its natural extensions will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure and the safeguards and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.

This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about. Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a counterfeit one if the serial number contains a checksum. Chances are the government has thought of this and just anyone won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a fake clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level. While not perfect it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation. Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here for example have already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little chance of getting a clearance. Of course it's not impossible that someone do this but probably extremely difficult.

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their product the manufacturer (actually better yet some trusted pair of escrow agencies) has to have the key. Most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our cars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number) and I have no doubt that if presented with a court order they'd surrender copies to the government. Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks they've installed and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for strong cryptography through a distinct organization. The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism which is only one step removed from the old crypto-wielding child molester argument.  An EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the connection to child pornography and the like. Similarly LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In light of say the Gnu Manifesto this means that in a public debate it stands to be labelled as communist anarchist hackers radical etc. I don't know about CPSR but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political baggage. Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing group but its charter should then be distinct independent and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not what are you going to do about it? Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction: gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial the woman CAN plead the fifth as to the location of the child--this is routine.  A computer crime prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense where a suit by a party injured by hackers would not.  If I am accused for example of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material however it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a crime in the technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is say I do both (naughty boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution.

I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post but that's what I get from posting at 1 am... The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants legit escrowed keys etc. may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level. I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops.  It would be a strong incentive as Vesselin points out for more police agencies to go rogue and try to get keys through more efficient (but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said: Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message? A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a ^^^^^^^^^^ court order to do the wiretap in the first place. ^^^^^^^^^^^ The clear implication is that there are legal authorizations other than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies in which keys are traded.  Furthermore the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There are a few laws that I know of that limit citizens' rights to access police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law. Throw in private detectives who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've retired from intelligence agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material. Don't think it'll happen? Well consider e.g. the Michigan State Police generally a very professional organization which for years kept Red Files on thousands of suspected commies knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where say a US-China People's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the meeting place well the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well.) Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many) there will be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest of enforcing sensible laws saving lives and protecting property. Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers facing what (to them) will be a moral dilemma. Clipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our police forces? +========================================================================+ |  dwight tuinstra             best:  tuinstra@sandman.ece.clarkson.edu  | |                         tolerable:  tuinstrd@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   | |                                                                        | |        Homo sapiens: planetary cancer??  ...

"2","grady@netcom.com suggests using a common but restricted-distribution private key to allow public key system encrypted postings. In theory that will work fine as long as the privae key remains secure. In practice it would be a good idea to check to see if that would be a violation of some net rule practice custom etc. I don't say it would be just that it would be a good idea to check. This is not like rot13 where everybody can have the key trivially. It would also be a good idea to check to see if such posts would be forwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work. Of course there'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over facilities entirely under the control of the members. Probably there would also be no problem with a mailing list approach. It might even  be fun for some. -- David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted."

I think with really large keyspaces like this you need to alter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of several blocks and check the disctribution of the contents.

I'm sure each of us can think of agencies without such a history. Price Waterhouse has kept the secret of the Academy Awards for many years even in the face of an aggressive press. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until publication. Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop forecasts from leaking prematurely.

[...] I don't claim to be a crypto analyist... there isn't a whole lot of good literature on the subject and the best people don't seem to publish their work :)  but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute force (sorry to have implied that in my previous post).  The history of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and bang from there. I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would make publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted... it just isn't in their charter.  Remember DES came from IBM not NSA and when first published was given a useful life of 20 years... I think we are well past that point now :( Remember based on the size of the NSA budget they spend a lot more on the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on R&D.  I have to imagine their stuff is real interesting... A friend who once worked for them (he is dead now) said he always enjoyed monitoring SAC's (Strategic Air Command) crypto traffic :)  and I rather suspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  (Or was it the military got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them ;) [BTW folks NSA wasn't being given the keys.

In fact if the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap chip I would have been happy.

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26 1993) ............................................................................ THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on cryptology held at Santa Barbara and is sponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy the Computer Science Department of the University of California Santa Barbara and Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees at the conference and formal proceedings will be published at a later date. In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the program committee there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to demonstrate hardware software and other items of cryptographic interest. If you wish to demonstrate such items you are urged to contact the General Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition there will be a beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included in the room and board charge and extra tickets may be purchased. ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the dormitories so those bringing small children will need to make separate arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. However participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire a parking permit. TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the Santa Barbara airport which is served by several airlines including American America West Delta United and US Air. Free shuttle bus service will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented in Santa Barbara and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles north of Los Angeles airport and 350 miles south of San Francisco. REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties but attendance at the workshop is limited and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late registrations subject to a late registration fee may be accepted if space is available but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register fill out the attached registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in full before July 9 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first come first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9 1993. The conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals >from dinner on Sunday to lunch on Thursday. Technical sessions will run >from Monday morning to Thursday at noon. A very limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends should be sent to the General Chair before June 4 1993. ............................................................................

CRYPTO '93  -  Hotel Information ............................................................................ For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories the following is a partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to stay off campus are responsible for making their own reservations and early reservations are advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara but that a car will probably be required to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject to change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels directly. However mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and in several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate which can be significantly less than the normal rates. We are not able to block rooms in these hotels so please make reservations as early as possible.

Just as we have seen in the past with <blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones <we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for <stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.

And since Clinton is also going full-bore to deny unconnected citizens the means to defend themselves (we will protect you ... 911 is good enough for you...) by perverting or trashing the Second Amendment the targeted individuals will be GUARANTEED easy prey.  What is a few bodies compared to the greater good of the Fed being able to defeat a citizen's security with impunity?  You don't think there doesn't exist a means by which the NSA can do their usual eavesdropping scanning for keywords with OR WITHOUT a court order or any 'keys' do you? If so I got some great Florida real estate you might be interested in... Perhaps the idea of escrowed keys is meant to divert the discussion to how they will be safeguarded and away from the basic fact that the government is systematically taking away our right to privacy to be secure for the means of self-defense and just about every other right spelled out in the Bill of Rights? Nawwww - they are the GOVERNMENT!  Trust us... <In other words Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a <current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and <persistent threat to the general public. What is more important to the government?  Law Enforcement (people control) or the safety of the general public?  The gun control issue should answer that one - look at how good that works in making cities safer:  The places that are the worst in that regard are also the places with the 'best' gun control.  Government is NOT about public good it is about CONTROL. Never forget that.

I don't know what's worse - the waste of money or the fact that (in SPITE of all Clinton's rhetoric to the contrary) this is a feeble attempt by a large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currently useless jobs. Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government. This doesn't look very dietetic to me! As I said before in this group: drug dealing and terrorism both tend to be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to regulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to other countries to communicate their plans and will still carry them out here and/or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem. They try to invent a new problem by saying we need encryption. I guess it's a good thing Bill Gates isn't a 4-star general or we would all need our own copies of MS-DOS too right?

This is true for the mass market but not for those who need strong crypto and are willing to pay the price. After all one can buy strong crypto today if one is willing to spend enough. Thus the concern is not economic. The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold the government will outlaw other systems and something voluntary will become the only system available. That is a political not an economic issue. As a separate matter you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure crypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent that except via Clipper but cheap secure crypto for everyone is a political discussion not an economic one and the whole point of Clipper is to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate communications and tapping the crooks. -- David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted."

But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.) The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR SK for the escrowed key and A and B for two random bit strings hand SK+A+B SK+A and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern for example 3 of 4 such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit. -- Robert I.

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish but there are certainly exceptions.  If you write a paper which includes sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon it is classified.  As I understand the law nuclear weapons design is _automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you are then not allowed to read your own paper. A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are about to run into you can be fined even though you might argue that you broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge is interfering with a police officer which is quite similar what you would be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip.

In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system? The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer armed with his warrant attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn. How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync. >Q:   Will the devices be exportable?

This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated either here or in the uk.telecom group that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not but this would make a good test case.

Patents exist to encourage communications and develop the state of the art. While there aren't classified patents there are patent secrecy orders. Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio and apply for a patent. The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested gives them a copy of your application and you get a nice note back saying your patent application has now been classified for national security reasons and you're no longer allowed to make and sell it. I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s. It was probably some analog scrambler and would have probably violated FCC rules anyway but it did get classified. Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and then file a patent application.  Since it's been published they can't gain anything by classifying it though you can't get patents in most countries other than the US where patent laws are different. Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus You can't sell that widget because there's a classified patent on it.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip then try flipping random key bits and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary on average from a 1-bit key change or input change. If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again though I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught. Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves which you have to XOR together to recover the program... Seriously there are I think problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them. That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e. one you can't explain to a Senator...). > Anyway its looking like the > keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA > can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number. I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure. I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant but I just reread Denning's technical information post and it doesn't say anything one way or the other. --Steve Bellovin"

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA and is an endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent but fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former in the long term unless you have the latter. One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird cross between a libertarian and an establishment tool is that I end up taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when the government fails to protect the interests of the people because in my lifetime it never has--therefore I have no expectation that it will. As a result I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government to be fair.  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem. What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal so much the better.  If it is not but does not violate my (very strong) sense of personal ethics I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its citizens except by accident is utter folly.  Even Jefferson one of the major architects of the American system of government figured that in a couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it would be time dismantle it and try again by revolution if necessary.  I agree and while I don't go around trying to spark one I'll certainly participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics. I've already written off politics. And yes this may get me in trouble some day.

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want less quality cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This requires a DSP or ASICs though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could probably do it in real-time because it has the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other DSP things. If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000 8-bit samples a second) which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1 compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps which is just about V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah but it should work. Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need sampling hardware which is no problem on a new Mac an Amiga.  Or a PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap - you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't sample and play backq at the same time making a two-way conversation a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be required. The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware but other than that I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is so I can't estimate how fast a PC you'd need. -- Not all men who drink are poets.

Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse engineering and all of that let me just point out that there already exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming -- this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device (again ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped the backups were all bad and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses. Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-) So on this point at least there's not so much worry. But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself likely to be secure methinks. -- Robert Bickford      A Hacker is any person who derives joy from rab@well.sf.ca.us    discovering ways to circumvent limitations. rab'86 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- I recognize that a class of criminals and juvenile delinquents has taken to calling themselves 'hackers' but I consider them irrelevant to the true meaning of the word; just as the Mafia calls themselves 'businessmen' but nobody pays that fact any attention.            rab'90 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-"

The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second. [...] F an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30-bit serial number U an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip The key K and message stream M (i.e. digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values: E[M; K] the encrypted message stream and E[E[K; U] + N; F] a law enforcement block. Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output: E[M;K] = 64 bits E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits E[ E[K;U] N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning? All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output? Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block or also to the wiretap block?  Or if the wiretap block is only transmitted at the beginning does it get incorporated into everything through feedback modes but not during ECB mode? 3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself? Does the block have to be present at all? Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U] so it's limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets it recognize a valid E[K;U].) In that case can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT wiretap block presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention? (The chip won't do it so you postprocess the output.) Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key; paranoid people can use someone else's serial number. On the other hand if I could think of that solution so easily presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it like use message encryption that's really E[M; KUN] ?

There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here). Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator.  Minutes followup comments to other participants and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted. Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group late and who might like to easily read earlier posts; second traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled; three a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet. And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip then try flipping random key bits and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary on average from a 1-bit key change or input change. If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again though I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught. Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47 and not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits wouldn't turn up anything interesting. Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb. The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb but I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which was well-hidden but would still make an exhaustive key search take far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that the real keysize can be verified externally. Andy Latto andyl@harlequin.com"

"2","As promised I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them). Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers. His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons several of which are: - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced. - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all. This stuck them as strange until now... Also I spoke with Art Melnick their cryptographer he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip: - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code. - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency of the government. - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm is vulnerable over time to an attacker. - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers or changing the keys themselves. - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed engineered that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip. Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little: - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is secure. - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm. The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret until the patent was issued but I was told that it will incorporate the following: - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given but Mr. Melnick stated Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.) - It is a symmetric cipher just like IDEA and DES. - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA). - The key length was not given to me but Mr. Melnick states that it is _adujustable_ and is More than adequate for security. - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form and can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use. - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the hardware chip. - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced enough which probably won't happen]). - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted data into blocks. This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know what the block header is. This program operates at all supported RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm. - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!! Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them they can be reached at..

Note: I am *not* a cable freak so I might have completely misunderstood what you said.  Also my math is frequently noted for being wrong so you'll better check the calculations yourself. I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and one stopbit and no protocol overhead the effective number of bytes per second is 1.44K. Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in stereo so that you can send 1440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz which should be too low especially if you think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore your D/A converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been cut off at 720 Hz but will instead alias in all the higher frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome that problem.) On the other hand speech should be easily compressible.  For example you could form power spectra or you could simply band-pass filter and then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor and compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical sounds not speech. Have fun. -- Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de> sig closed for inventory.  Please leave your pickaxe outside.

But what about second sources for pin-compatible non-Clipper algorithm chips that also have escrowed keys?  If a reputable firm produces a chip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper chip in my phone and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated and trusted then what's the problem? The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization with sufficient resources (can you say billions of cocaine dollars?) so those drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the cracks.  We law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens naturally will not have this recourse.  But claiming that the algorithm can't be released to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain deceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on the necessary headers and whatnot so the bad guys could build chips using a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys. Or they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at K-mart every week and play Swap-the-Clipper-Chip with their cellular phone every day. Michael T.

The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons of course but I certainly can't think of any honest ones. Next you assume we can trust the escrow houses. But the last time I checked EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure corruption and even fabrication of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying Yeah but NOW we're serious so you can trust us.  Bullcrypt. And finally although you didn't state it explicitly you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score. Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers right?  As others have pointed out the current proposal will if deployed render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford and be sufficiently motivated to purchase this expensive inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete? The other flaw of course is that making something voluntary today ensures that it will be voluntary in the future.

One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less) I am not going to care much about US confidentiality am I?

It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked don't open me.  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions. >Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by >cracking the system outside the USA.

Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines) but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture. However as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs then the inclusion of such techniques seems credible. Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name Clipper for this device. :) -- Ian Farquhar                      Phone : + 61 2 805-9400 Office of Computing Services      Fax   : + 61 2 805-7433 Macquarie University  NSW  2109   Also  : + 61 2 805-7420 Australia                         EMail : ifarqhar@laurel.ocs.mq.edu.au."

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there it won't be long before someone decaps it and after a bit of work has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do but then again it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with and given a description of the input output control and supply lines figure out the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.

"2","Having read the various Clipper announcements on the net over the last few days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip its uses government plots etc I have the following questions. 1) What does the Clipper chip actually implement? Just the Skipjack cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a chip to chip communications protocol? If it does implement a communications protocol can it be used as just a crypt chip also. 2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained? 3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions? 4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system? 5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does not appear to require that the Family key be a secret. Why is it a secret? What happens when the family key becomes well known? If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult does the Law enforcement message contain any random information?

Remember I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real >sense--if I did I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it. I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true as far as it goes.  However the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap terrorists and drug dealers is to restrict stronger techniques. Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption weak encryption or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*. The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography and only by this restriction.  Clipper appears to be no more than a sop given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon .50 caliber maybe.  Who wants to have such a thing legal?  Well people know even less about cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need. >That's not for Clinton (or anyone under him) to say though.

What they say is opinion but what they do is what matters and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it. >Amanda Walker PGP 2 key by finger or e-mail Eli   ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu"

But how do you propose we take government back?  They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release to see what the entity 'clipper' was and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH SEE IF I AM WRONG. The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking it back.

"2","Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation. THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised April 21 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16 the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the Clipper Chip together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key. CHIP CONTENTS The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called Skipjack.  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second. Each chip includes the following components: the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change) U an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip The chips are programmed by Mykotronx Inc. which calls them the MYK-78.  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron. ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method. Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values: E[M; K] the encrypted message stream and E[E[K; U] + N; F] a law enforcement field  which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed. The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key: D[E[M; K]; K] = M . CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility) which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx. At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus the unit keys are a function of 160 secret random bits where each agent knows only 80. To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 producing a 64-bit block R1: R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . Similarly N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed: R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies. As a sequence of values for U1 U2 and U are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts. The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind. The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies. The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the NSA CIA FBI or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government. LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g. via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents who return (e.g. also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder. CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION A successor to the Clipper Chip called Capstone by the government and MYK-80 by Mykotronx has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22 and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

"2","Exactly. But I'll add another observation: if the chip does become a standard the algorithm won't _remain_ secret. Leaving the government with the only remaining option: to make use of un-escrowed keys illegal. Which won't begin to bother the terrorists and child abusers the government is so fond of referring to. Note that the Federalist papers stress _one_ reason for the right of citizens to bear arms: to defend themselves _against_ the army. _Our_ army. IMHO the _primary_ purpose of private crypto is defend ourselves _against_ the government. The odd terrorist I'm not worried about; the goverment damages my quality of life every day.

Excellent point and there's a related point I'd like to make. They'll have to back up these databases themselves won't they? How many tape copies will there be and how secure will the tapes be?  If they store them off-site it wouldn't be too hard to hijack them in transit.  If they're all kept on-site one good bomb attack by some group intent on freeing us from the threat of government snooping will take care of the problem once and for all.  I can see it now -- Hi we're from the government and we um misplaced our copy of your key.  Could you mail us a copy?"

"2","After reading the debate over the Clipper I have a few things to add. First most of the people I know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That after all IS the bottom line. Second if I look at all the people I know who use any form of encryption at all and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies I can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this because people make mistakes by nature and the US government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. Third since most of the people I know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip. That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So I can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip. Fourth when it comes to criminal abuse sure there are many stupid people out there. And yes some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and I would assume start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. If nothing else were avalible none of this would be an issue. However the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything else. If it works they use it. This is not going to change either. I do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is if anything the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user. The bottom line here is that people will use what works and unavoidibly I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy. The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping Pandora's Box has been opened) and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness to this that I've found utterly stunning and the Clipper Chip along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree.

"2","From Denning: the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30-bit serial number U an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip E[M; K] the encrypted message stream and E[E[K; U] + N; F] a law enforcement block. Where the session key is K and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F. Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else differential analysis). Postulate if you will a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold: 1) Transmit Channel The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key 2) Receive Channel The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the law enforcement block is necessary for local operation - checksums sequence control etc.). This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U U1U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F and because they could recover it themselves The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F]. The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened. What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks? One way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M as well as spoofing the law enforcement block. The goal is to use a secure communications scheme without redress to detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required for proper operation. It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K); The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all they are high security encryption systems right? Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones or once the number of units is high enough stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice from a point of privacy if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream. Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme. ****************************************************************************** If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission. The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints. The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them but hey there's supposed to be millions of these things right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock? ***************************************************************************** The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated."

If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission block reflecting the law enforcement block it better not fall on 64 bit block boundaries.  If it were a recognizeable datum you could lie with it too. I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK-80.  I remember reading that Intel had an approved random noise source on silicon hence the ability to put it Inside.

"2","My earlier argument that Clipper will encourage state and local cops to commit criminal acts is largely moot now that we've learned that the FBI will perform the actual tap.  [It will encourage the *FBI* to commit (even more) criminal acts but that's not the point here.] But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now and the projected future. From these figures estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected. Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more Clipper-tapping stations and how rapidly they could be built and installed ... ie get the plus or minus epsilon for the near future. Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know these things. And despite all the technical details [BTW thanks to those who've been providing them!] we still don't know 1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme). 2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?) 3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete. +========================================================================+ |  dwight tuinstra             best:  tuinstra@sandman.ece.clarkson.edu  | |                         tolerable:  tuinstrd@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   | |                                                                        | |        Homo sapiens: planetary cancer??  ...

Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever or tries it to turn them into voice-output ?

I'm a single person but I react differently on different groups (admittedly in part because I'm a contrarian you always shouts but on the other hand...). On top of that I _loath_ certainty and have taken public positions in the past for no reason other than to challenge conventional wisdom. I wish them luck in figuring out who I am based on that information.

"2","Just a little nitpicking. Wasn't it the government that required a standard railway gauge ? Didn't that improve things ? Please don't misunderstand. I'm utter suspicious of this Clipper chip. Why hold the design TOP SECRET ? Was this a work around the law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the government is public domain. ( e.g. NIH Class Library etc. ) DES has its designs published all over the place and it is considered fairly strong ( although could be stronger ). - Ants"
"2","I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) factor. If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the Feds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from superior competition. Comments?"

My MDC cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream cipher the current implementation uses MD5) uses a key of up to 2048 bits (that is you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire 2048-bit range or you can use the entire 2048 bits).

[...] Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2? By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in one session. This would not btw enable anybody else to retrieve the keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (NU) pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure i.e. they have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)

Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses drinks and lighting divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the private sector anyway.

Still I wonder.  That there are only 60 bits of key information should in principle be detectable.

Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history. That's not very good odds. Somebody once said something like: Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder. Let's try to avoid killing things eh?  There's enough blood shed in the world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars etc. I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here and there's no difficulty in picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can lock in on one and average the others out. The signals are weird in any case with varying polarisations and all sorts of interactions with the building. Just moving a folded dipole around is also highly effective as a (randomised) means of switching from one monitor to another Ross"

First of all the chip doesn't do that.  It runs at 16 megabits/second which is far beyond what you need for voice.  It's obviously intended for data as well and on high-speed lines at that. Second -- what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone? I don't care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they'll have 5 years from now.  They can't update every Clipper chip that's out there. Third -- if they did do this preprocessing in the chip it would probably have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  If nothing else that would hurt the acceptability of the product.  The V.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly- massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix and you're completely out of the ballpark."

"2",": From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff) : Message-ID: <1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu> : It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications : would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future : probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained. I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones record calls without listening to them and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least not in the near term.) In other words near as I can tell the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts. Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future start surveilance start archiving data trump up some probable cause decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand and the investigation gets a boost from data that sadly won't ever be presented to a jury. While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes read Lacey and his Friends a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey this is nothing new we already have cameras in banks and teller machines don't we? And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But see there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane. And hey nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me* no need to be self-conscious. After all if you're not doing anything illegal... Funny though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams which includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands they are normally disabled since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted here I felt it was time to clear things up.  So EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with Clipper. I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987 and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography security and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand. The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is not a source for information it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet. While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice (albeit unfriendly to some) and any effect of disabling it again was unintentional. -John Wack"

Standard voice circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the US. Therefore you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality. If you're willing to give up some quality you need only 2:1.

It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned the most difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it the average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If there is a perceived need for cellular encryption then the companies will provide one.  Most likely a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their own or buy a cheaper one.

Also hope they get sued over re-using the name Clipper. -- ---------------------------------------Cyberspace:-------------------------- | David T.

"2","Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch it seems clear that one of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the Judicial Branch.  I suggest the Supreme Court or regionally the Courts of Appeal.  More specifically the offices of their Clerks. Courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations.  Some of these records are confidential.  So the concept of a court holding information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal precedents.  The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be.  So judicial control of keys is appropriate. For the other half of the key I suggest a unit of Congress the General Accounting Office.  The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keeping tabs on the Executive Branch and has an excellent reputation.  It's controlled strictly by Congress; the Executive Branch has no authority over it. With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches we might have a chance of this system working honestly.  If of course a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before they reach the repositories. This should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the whole Clipper concept.  But if we have to have it splitting control across all three branches of government might make it work. John Nagle"

"2","I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be wrong.....) from THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised April 21 1993 . . . The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called Skipjack.  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second. Each chip includes the following components: the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change) U an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip . . . ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method. Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values: E[M; K] the encrypted message stream and E[E[K; U] + N; F] a law enforcement field  which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed. ------------------ suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip but did not know F then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder. Now suppose that I know F (either legitimately or not) If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation or I know U for a party in the conversation) I may now be able to determine U for the other party. If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field since I could make my own with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too. Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys or for that matter that the published method is in fact used perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system. Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some panel of experts is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F forget grinding chips bribery and blackmail work just fine. So am I wrong? Or are these problems. jon"

This has to be a dictionary attack.  No other attack makes sense. This means that whoever encrypted the file just typed some password which was a single dictionary word and then Russell tried all the words in the dictionary.  This isn't too implausible especially if he was smart and clipped the first plaintext block off the ciphertext (if the first block doesn't decrypt then obviously the others won't either). Assuming one attempt a second it takes seven hours to try all the words in /usr/dict/words.   Not real tough. If you want DES to be secure you have to use RANDOM KEYS.

As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb you can figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods. (The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end those that sell thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones are in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the cost of the phone by approx $100 or about 25% - 30%. I don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this. -tony >>usual disclaimer<<"

Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect directly to a modem. The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence is not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used and its possible that might be noticed but could be edited from the netlist. I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a design done in two layer metalization yet finding a third layer under the microscope. The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm operating protocols the agency having physical control of the devices the silicon implementation.

"2","WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE? by Robin Hanson Draft April 21 1993 SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part in three thousand to be cost-effective. BACKGROUND Until now phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over time law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigations.  However powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo by making possible truly private communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphones at either end. In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap phone conversations the U.S. government announced on April 16 1993 that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip to be placed in future phones instead of the total privacy chips which have been under private development.  The same day AT&T announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone products. Each chip would be created under government supervision when it would be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info in a special law enforcement block.  Law enforcement officers with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen in on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone. To date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it has claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not inspire confidence on this point [1]. However this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation.  That is which is a cheaper way for society to investigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps or give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways? Or to put it another way would police agencies be willing to pay for each wiretap if they had to pay their share of the full social cost of forcing phones to support wiretaps? To start to answer this question we might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current benefits are easier to estimate we begin there. WIRETAP BENEFITS 1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available [2].  In that year 872 wiretap installations were requested and no requests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained with the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year 1486 arrests came from wiretaps in previous years and 55% of arrests led to convictions. 76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers email etc.) 60% were regarding drug offenses and 40% were requested by federal authorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487 calls 22% of them incriminating among 131 people and cost an average of $45125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations reporting costs) mostly for labor. Thus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps to obtain about 4000 arrests at $10000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at least four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one gets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the total 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police expenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone access lines in the country [3] we get about 23 cents spent per year per phone line or about two cents a month. In general we deter a given class of criminals through a combination of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted and some expected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to wiretap a particular suspect's phone police might instead use hidden microphones or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime. If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be on average twice as expensive as wiretaps then the annual social benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level of two cents a month per phone line. WIRETAP COSTS Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying ears of neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and domestic.  Even so the need to support wiretaps would add many additional costs to build and maintain our communication system. Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions increasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must be used to add encryption keys to chips while securely distributing these keys to special agencies which must be funded and monitored. The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor whose design is to remain secret and are manufactured through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart. (Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in lots of 10000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none of these extra costs. Perhaps most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to be represented encrypted and exchanged in our future phones.  It is widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise in procuring products and standards though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private standards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate some say they pay twice as much while others might say only 10% more. Currently a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of U.S. phone companies [3] which comes out to about $60 per month per access line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per month we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even as much as one part in 3000 then wiretaps are not cost effective! And this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones wouldn't have encryption chips for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same so this argument still applies. CONCLUSION Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the phone system and the value of wiretaps we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps. When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to attach clips to phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable. But when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof is clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs would really be less than the benefits. If consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate a compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a rate of say five cents per month a tax payable to police agencies nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.

The Motorola Codex preliminary V.Fast modem (which you can by right now) does 24.4 kbps (raw) over standard phone lines.  28.8 kbps is what is usually claimed for the final v.fast but you can't go out and buy that right now the standard isn't done yet. Again voice can be compressed quite well down to 4000 or 8000 bps depending on how good you want it to be but that requires a DSP or a special ASIC to do in real-time. -- I think I am!

A little perspective might be in order. The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. Law enforcement has to present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of authorizations. Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor recorded by the government and for that to happen they have to: a) Have a pretty good reason with evidence; b) Use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons.

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples 8k samples/sec) into 4800 baud. However DSP is hairy and I have yet to see actual proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to spare but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy -- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code without having beaten on it for a very very long time first.

It would be nice to know that they are not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the U.S. government. While we are at it the chip design(s) should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  There is no proof that the chip won't squeel and role over for someone with the proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link. The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Also how does one verify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout or masks? The silicon should be examined as well the design in hand (a clean room publicly defined clipper chip) can be merged with another design later or changed between completion and mask out.  There is little proof that what you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip. Put the (verified) masks in escrow and use them for chip production use a third escrow party for programming the chips. The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm operating protocols the agency having physical control of the devices the silicon implementation.  If the  government is so trustworthy why escrow anything?"

The government decided to discourage them. Really none of this stuff is especially hard. All you need for a true private phone is an ISDN codec a vocoder (either a chip or software) an encryptor (a chip is fine but software is more than fast enough) a V.32 or V.32bis modem module and maybe a microcontroller to run the whole thing. Its easy to do its cheap. And any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit from the boys in the dark suits from Washington just like Qualcomm did. I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their products are too expensive. However no law yet stops one from building really private phones in spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new crime bill and in connection with the Clipper/Skipjack Big Brother chip.

Have the feds shut down the people making Sound Blaster? What about Apple and NeXT? Apple NeXT Sun and others make systems that can handle CD-quality audio in and out and can perform arbitrary transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network or modem. Perhaps there's a market for a portable vocoder. Not a crypto device simply an RS232<->voice converter. Make it capable of recording speech and playing it back simultaneously. It has applications for multimedia computing for the handicapped Internet Talk Radio IRC etc etc etc.  It wouldn't be a cryptographic device at all - but I suppose someone could have it hooked to a 486 laptop with a V.32bis modem and some crypto software. I'd market the thing with an API for text-to-speech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech samples. And of course I'd publish the interface to it so other folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing. mjr."
"2","I just joined this group recently and really do not know much about cryptography but a couple things came to mind while reading through the posts. 1.  Is the Clipper chip going to be exported?  If not how will people communicate with other countries?  Will they have to do that in un-crypt-mode.  Will other encryption techniques be legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when going overseas but not within the states? 2.  I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted PIN based on the time/date.  The host system has the algorithm built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user. Is there some form of encryption technology that would create keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  The systems would then allow a window of time around this instant where the key would work. I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather than just keys.  But for smaller scale things it might work. Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that are issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week (for instance).  If further surveilance was needed they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another key.  This would make it useless for local police to database keys they have used. I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need to be able to decypher the message.  But any thoughts on the subject? Thanks Tauren Mills Tauren Mills tauren@rigel.cs.pdx.edu"

Right.  People here believe the government is listening in on everything.  Sure.  If you can't provide an answer change the assumptions to something you can deal with. It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything it's a matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in. Say if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a mall the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search and acquires your name.

By almost I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack.  The chosen plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run if I understand the situation correctly.  This is certainly a break under the meaning of the Act but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch. The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and observe the results.  I wish him joy of it and choose not to try that attack. I am not defending the system and in fact am offended by the ideas of escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard. However I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons since that weakens the case against it. I said (in my private e-mail): >> It's not clear that the experts will be told F.

No it's quite different.  The government would have no percentage in choosing F to be a weak key since it's not to their advantage to have anybody else know it.  The experts could thus assume that F is no worse than anything else during their analysis.  Totally different situation from unknown S-boxes.

"2","Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece New Encryption to sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company Secured Communications Technologies Inc and on encryption algorithm NEA. I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot of ground.  Some of the information in the posting requires some clarification and I would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci.crypt. SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our two main products at this time are a PC based secure communications program called SECOM and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM. SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link between two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines.  It supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen chat.  It has its own proprietary communications protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All though it is a packetized link the data stream appears to be continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden. When SECOM was initially developed it was implemented to use DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export approval for the product because it was perceived that the overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing opportunity. We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general export approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason for this was never explicitly stated it seems to have something to do with secret government to government agreements which are still in effect. In any event the decision was made to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This was the reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born. At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  The preliminary work of patenting it has begun and the plan is to make it public once the patent process is complete.  All though one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing secret I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is necessary to let people shoot at it over an extended period of time to prove its worth. In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA it was necessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of the program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a finished product to submit. Let me state unequivocally that there is NO back door to the program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications Technologies is a closely held private company and NSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved. From a practical business standpoint we are interested in selling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a back door to the encryption if found out could destroy our credibility and our business. With the encryption algorithm approved for export we set out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption products and systems.  We were able to identify several common threads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm cast in silicon and certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirements that we identified. We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In a press release today our president Dr. Stephen Bryen stated: It seems as if the government has an unlimited source of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security Agency which is not supposed to be involved in domestic spying can fund the development of a commercial chip intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying activities. If they had asked me to put a back door in NEA I would have told them to g__ f____ed. Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES RSA IDEA Diffy-Hellman PGP RC2 RC4 or whatever?  I don't know and probably never will."

A friend of mine worked for an electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold equipment to the Japanese. One day the Japanese started showing up with discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the products. This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend the computer systems admin came up with a solution. He started sending the data out double-block-encrypted with DES. Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented the president of the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to knock it off. The president gave in since his company did a considerable business with the federal government. Now if the government wasn't monitoring the communications how would they even know that the encryption system was installed? Further since encryp- tion isn't illegal and DES certainly isn't what is the basis of the government's cease-and-desist demand? The spooks do whatever they think is necessary with or without the blessings of the law. I'll say no thanks to Clipper or anything else the government produces.

A circut court judge in Illinois once said When dealing with a government that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means to parry this attack on personal privacy. (Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar detectors....) The point remains.  More and more I see the government slowly washing away privacy.  Even unwittingly.  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth?  Do you think I will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they can keep track of what I'm saying?  Even if there is no evidence of my guilt?  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  I'm tired of it.  There is (IMHO) no compromise with an administration that seeks to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy. More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to the public and I am sickened.  I am revolted.  I am repulsed. 90% perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration. This saddens and frightens me. I am a conserveative believe it or not.  A law and order conserveative. But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the intelligence of the American people.  Tell them it's going to keep them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you put cameras in their home. Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly totalatarian moves. >Somebody once said something like: Armed Violence is meant only to be >used in response to an armed attack.

Robin's calculation is interesting and important even if it's off by an order of magnitude (for example). Even if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO the protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much higher than the 1 part in 3 thousand...it depends on the exact details of the phone call length protocol etc. (shorter calls get a proportionately greater hit).

Interesting.  Tell us what happens if I were to say OK I want to have something else.  If the law enforcement wants my traffic they can record it then get a search warrant and get the keys FROM ME just like they would the keys to a stout private safe etc. (Lets say I suspect that there is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level with no warrant say for NSA scanning for keywords etc. and the government has abused great power in the past...).

You are surely not going to say the people are not to know until it is too late... This IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE isn't it?  That is the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSES want to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here... You see I am kind of nervous because in the last month or so I have seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom from Govt eavesdropping) and the ability to defend ourselves against violent attack (no 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk' they arrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had to depend on 911...).   You see with all that talk about National smart ID cards limiting of encryption to 'government approved' denial of means to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now) it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would take is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions... and with no effective data protection and with the people suitably disarmed there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it now would there?  All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ... drugs and of course that catch word 'terrorists'.  What is wrong with good OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case?  They don't want to have to be burdened to leave the office it seems... Please read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US Constitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish policy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind isn't it?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote it? Reassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda the Administration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret then springing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE to me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were NOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little bit curious don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not vote for come election time... Yes I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this because I recall it was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could have been the SAME thing it was so close) a few months ago...  I also recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be really didn't care (or were not told or both). From what I see Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't want the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don't think I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext. Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious trade-secret data especially if millions depended on that security. Given enough money one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked judge and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou they wouldn't be hard to find.  So we end up with only criminals terrorists and the Government with real security and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know the first two if they are serious ain't going to use this thing for THEIR communications.  I bet the government won't either (except perhaps to order a pizza). Tell us will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity someone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an unconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door raid and confiscation of all one's equipment as 'terrorist tools' using civil forfeiture so there will be no inconvenient need to PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen? I have yet another question are we going to see articles in all the public magazines consisting of soothing text telling us how great this is how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion of privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to let us 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I am correct here? Please answer these questions.  As citizens of the United States we hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have out of the goodness of their hearts... Funny thing though - with all these proposals I don't feel ONE BIT safer from drug dealers terrorists or a common street thug.

"2","The clipper chip's User key is formed by: R1 = E[D[E[N1;S1];S2];S1] R2 = E[D[E[N2;S1];S2];S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3;S1];S2];S1] Why is the triple-encrytion used?  Is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch?  (If so why use 80 bit keys?)  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm it's not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess S1S2. Why are N1 N2 and N3 formed as they are?  It would be facinating to see the Skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way. Where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form N1N2N3 come from?  Are they changed from chip to chip or session to session?  (Even if they're published in the NY Times if SkipJack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks when using triple- encryption then there's no break in security.  But why allow that kind of weird format?  If those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits then maybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack if it exists can't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production run of these chips....) Does Dorothy Denning read this group?  If not is someone on the group forwarding questions like these to her or Martin Hellman or anyone else who's seen more details about the chip? --John Kelsey"
"2","The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust issue.  Even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits) I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they are feeding into the system."

The Evil Empire is gone.  The NSA is not.  They will do something to fill their time and justify their budgets.

Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test new features around.  Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version) was unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received a request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now there is almost no way that some automatic scanner could have found this since they wouldn't have known about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the message tried to unscramble it found they couldn't get past the PEM armour part and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop.  Luckily the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their networks :-). In case people think email scanning doesn't take place I can assure you that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government agencies (or at least not that I know of) but by local administrators who for reasons of their own have decided to monitor all communications (I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/ terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).  There have been several occasions when I've got people into trouble simply by including the traditional NSA bait in a message (I don't try it any more now :-).  A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of the UK town of Scunthorpe (hint: look for words embedded in it).

It is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation here thanks to our pet computers.  This is not true.  David Kahn's The Codebreakers a history of cryptography makes two things obvious: 1.	Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals and has been going on for thousands of years.  [Teen-age slang and cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous creation.] 2.	The systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as (and sometimes more secure than) those used by military and diplomatic users *of that time* (although they seem very simple and insecure today). [e.g. In places the Bible used a more complex simple substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches but before Caesar.] I commend Kahn's book to all who might be interested. -- - <<Disclaimer: All opinions expressed are my own of course.>> - Carl Ellison                                        cme@sw.stratus.com - Stratus Computer Inc.

You should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence your congresscritters; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest rung of the opinion ladder. If you want to write (and I think you should!) take the time to really *write* a letter.  Things to emphasize: - It's been said that Usenet is available to the 'technical elite' i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi- ties.  Emphasize that you are part of the group that will be making/developing/using Clinton's 'data superhighway.' - Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing and data communications. (if this is the case; don't call your- self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   This will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  Don't turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the technical sides of the issue. - Don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  Remember your letter will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may even be a college student; if they don't understand it your views won't even make the 'running total' sheets. - Be concise; don't ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place. Cite references if necessary but only use accepted references like academic journals.  My neighbor Jim is *not* a real refer- ence.  8) - Unfortunately very few Congresscritters *really* understand electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access to Compuserve America Online or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so offer them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them *will* give your opinions more credence. - In addition to sending mail to your representatives send mail to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing with the issue.  If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor. --Wes ps> I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the more traditional media but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record in the analogy department.  8) -- Rachel Elizabeth Morgan  --  4/13/93 7:00 am    | Oh yeah I can be reached as 9 pounds 4 ounces (despite coming 3 weeks early) |     morgan@engr.uky.edu |----------------------------- To netters who gave constant encouragement and prayer - thanks for everything!"

There is one point I'd like to make that most people seem to have forgotten. That is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST of governmental authority and control. All those checks & balances is because they realize that you should distrust those in power. What everyone seems to have forgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the right to bear arms. It's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself against other citizens but to prevent the government from taking away your only means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government. Its hard to oppress your citizenry when its armed against you. I am not a fanatic I'm a retired Naval officer.

Congress may pass a law setting up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. Some future congress may change that law. Suppose pre-nazi Germany had a clipper system. Do you think the escrow agencies would have told Hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid court order? In effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance.

This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser not a weakness in DES.  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper that came out about 2.5 years ago in both Computer Communications Review and Usenix.  For that matter it was loudly discussed on the Kerberos mailing list even earlier. The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES and everything to do with bad password selection. I'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks possible on DES.  I'm quite dubious that private research labs know them.  And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well established; see for example the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the July '91 Cryptologia.  You're not going to do it in an hour with only ``rather powerful DES hardware''.  I'll leave the arithmetic as an exercise for the reader.  On average you'll need to do 2^55 trials. Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs and for how many such engines are used."
"2","I came. I lurked. I read the FAQ. Now having purchased the recommended books and having taken to heart the advice that one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst I would like to correspond with people interested in cryptology. I am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in Booch's OOD with Applications. I hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking them.  I would like to start with simple Ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to David Kahn's book. Of course I would be interested in general discussions and math also. I hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the men in the suits I've been hearing so much about. Unfortunately as a product of the American education system I only know English. Looking forward to any and all responses.

"2","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Gasp! I've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here (slow reader I guess) and I really have to put out a few comments too.  First let me flame the famous Dave S. : He's obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him some slack. :^} The joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job guys!  I've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years now Clinton's actions so far have really helped.  But because of government action taken against various other groups I have developed a 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list. The S-boxes are the critical component and since I chose 32 out of 57 based on the key cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a different set of s-boxes I know it's only a vector but it sure makes random search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug use/sales.  It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org *but* you will be watched. It really is important to write a letter to every official you personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by the cripple chip.  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get *enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real and the IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we *are* seeing some changes. It's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the implimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselin points out this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be again depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns and law abiding citizens don't and criminals like me have marijuana and law abiding subjects don't criminals like me will have secure crypto while law abiding robots don't.  PGP is nice but as time goes on we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will. Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He's my favorite dude. 500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are* and tried to explain that to princes who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted (I've got The Prince at home so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do with conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy* it.  Failing that you must appoint locals to high positions and accept the people's customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression a people will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive government.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before* Thomas Jefferson. There were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic is watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords like marijauana cryptography NSA;  certain individuals who are known subversives etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if you know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen it's pretty easy to go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the less you're noticed the better your chances of developing an organization which can diseminate truth to the masses. Which gets me to the thread about a public encrypted conference. That's just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an infiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing.  It will be fun for teenagers and college students but for the real world it's pretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where you get your marijuana. Guns drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in government who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in alt.drugs Live free or don't.  Machiavelli pointed out that's just how most people actually live inspite of appearences to the contrary. It's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as Intergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the U.S. was founded on but the government is full of idiotic robots called bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might think.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be hurt by this the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom. de Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government. And given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne National Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.

Maybe so but it's quite common. There are millions of Macintosh users who have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs. Many have modems connected. How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen? Answer: 1. Because you trust Apple; 2. Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would destroy Apple's credibility forever. Then there's also 3) Because it's NOT SECRET.  If I want to I CAN go look at Apple's copyrighted ROMs in a Mac so they're not keeping any secrets. You don't even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope you just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it means. (Motorola object code isn't all *that* obscure!) Yes it's copyrighted so I can't go selling copies or using the copy myself but I CAN see it and disassemble it. 4) They're not asking me to trust their honesty.  They're asking me to trust the quality of their assembly language programming :-) but I can see for myself what the performance price and crashes/day are.

Qualcomm wants to sell to nice lucrative overseas markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them don't do encryption if you ever hope to export this technology.  The reason that CDMA doesn't have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door. It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms Regulations all over again. Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas and the government told them they wouldn't be allowed to export so he's only blowing the same smoke you are :-) Sure they probably could have made a US version and a non-crypto export version and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to develop an overseas crypto ROM but that's getting pretty expensive. No Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes money--that's capitalism comrade. Well some people like capitalism and others prefer free enterprise; they're different!

If you think it's so easy why are you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it? Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do; writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill. Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you don't have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff. Once the 586/Pentium becomes widespread or the next generation of sound boards has DSPs on it I suspect we'll see it happen.

"2","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Meeting of the UK Cryptoprivacy Association - ------------------------------------------- Saturday 8 May 1993 1500 To be held at the offices of: FOREST 4th floor 2 Grosvenor Gardens London  SW1W 0DH This is located at the corner of Hobart Place a couple of blocks west of Victoria Station and almost directly across from the dark green cabbie shelter. If you have trouble finding the place please call the office on 071-823-6550.  Or call me (Russell Whitaker) on my pager 081-812-2661 and leave an informative message with the telephone number where you can be reached; I will return the call almost immediately. Discussion will range from the usual general topics such as the use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data to specific topics such as recent moves by the U.S. government to restrict choice in data privacy (reference recent discussion on Usenet groups e.g. sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp). All are invited.  Particularly welcome are members of the newly-formed UK CommUnity group ... the local EFF-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks. Those who plan to attend should email me and let me know. Please. All attendees are requested to bring diskettes - preferably MS-DOS - with their PGP 2.+ public keys.  As is usual at these gatherings several of us will bring our laptops and will sign public keys subject to the usual caveats (reference the documentation for PGP 2.2 specifically files PGPDOC1.DOC and PGPDOC2.DOC). If you do not already have a copy of PGP 2.2 (MS-DOS) and would like to have a copy of this public domain program please bring a formatted medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy PC diskette; you will be provided a copy of the program. Of course you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from one of the various archive sites.  I suggest trying Demon Internet Systems which carries the full range of PGP (Phil Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy) implementations: directory /pub/pgp at gate.demon.co.uk. Meetings are of indeterminate time.  Those who are interested are invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly determined pub afterwards. Please note: - ------------ In the past few months interested people have emailed me requesting FAQs and special information mailings.  I regret that except in very unusual cases (e.g. working press) I cannot in a timely manner respond to these requests.  I will however - and for the first time - do a writeup of this meeting which I will post in various places. What I *am* willing to supply is general information on our activities for the maintainers of existing FAQs such as that for alt.privacy.  FAQ maintainers can contact me at whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk Russell Earl Whitaker                   whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk Communications Editor                                 AMiX: RWhitaker EXTROPY: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought Board member Extropy Institute (ExI) ================ PGP 2.2 public key available ======================= -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: 2.2 iQCVAgUBK9bG/ITj7/vxxWtPAQG0/AQAmPQKQl7KNB43DyniRyuDu5tixStXd2F7 k5CiWNwN/u9ExZfptPgajwY91dsafX0H53RV5+lT8OSnvIx35QMmgBmPQOJCGnGj ZUJ2eGiSvfuLtAmgMQtSLtJh5x/VXmUIl8SJHzrffIz3SjnKcENTzrQnGc7UdIQ6 x85InstiJzU= =Y9GS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

One very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field. It is not used at all by the encryption algorithm. It seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be otherwise compatible but would send out a bogus law enforcement field. This might render the device unusable with normal devices if there's some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field but it could certainly be used with other such modified devices. Of course this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the algorithm but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system. -- Wilt thou seal up avenues of ill?

This article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com) My thanks to the people who responded both on usenet and from Oracle Corp. The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$ included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to use table views to refine the granularity of access control. One important security consideration in networked installations is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's or limit access of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv option) while relying on host security for local processes. Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the Oracle environment. Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access to your oracle database files through the host operating system s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords. As security risks go the above scenario is pretty low severity. Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break the passwords however s/he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism's and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix) provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not guessable. As with all computer security the most important defense is to educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual (both available from ftp archive servers) and UNIX(R) System Security (Curry David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992) Forrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.com Boston Scientific Corp.

Well they can't listen in on much of mine since I already use cryptography for much of my electronic mail and will start using it for my telephony as soon as practical. However allow me to tell a parable. There was once a far away land called Ruritania and in Ruritania there was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in Ruritainia were transparent. Now in the days when people had lived in mud huts this had not been a problem but now high-tech wood technology had been developed and in the new age of wood everyone in Ruritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now until this point no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on someone's home but the new technology made this tempting. This being a civilized country however warrants were required to use binoculars and watch someone in their home. The police taking advantage of this would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going on. Occassionally they would use binoculars without a warrant but everyone pretended that this didn't happen. One day a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely private. Indignant the state decided to try to require that all homes have video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. After all they said with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability -- they are just keeping the old one. A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the lives of the police easy that the police had survived all through the mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will and that Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was expedient was permitted. For instance in a neighboring country it had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to solve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its expedience. Indeed why have warrants at all he asked if we are interested only in expedience? A famous paint technologist Dorothy Quisling intervened however. She noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards and the law was passed. Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths while speaking to each other thus preventing the police from reading their lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented the police said. After all it was preventing them from conducting their lawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never before been allowed to listen in on people's homes but Dorothy Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and mutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused of being in favor of mutilating children but then again no one wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked so a compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old lip reading technology but it was too late -- the microphones were installed everwhere. However it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent citizens from hiding information from the authorities because some of them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not understand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at all times only in Ruritanian and for good measure to require that they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. After all Dorothy Quisling pointed out they might be using the opportunity to speak in private to mask terrorist activities!  Terrorism struck terror into everyone's hearts and they rejoiced at the brulliance of this new law. Meanwhile the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania of which all Ruritanians were proud. Why he asked are we obligated to sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police easier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in crime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state! However the wise man made the mistake of saying this as the law required in Ruritanian clearly and distinctly and near a microphone.  Soon the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived and took him off and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture was after all far more efficient than the old methods and had been recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene thoughts about tomatoes which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the major problems of the new age of plenty and joy. -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire laissez passer.

HOWEVER every US citizen has a general export license allowing export of lots of things including constitutionally protected speech. This has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some things which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without first obtaining a license. > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only > way to find out is to apply for a license. Nope talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  But in general the government has to have a very good national security case to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to publish.  (Yes I worded that the way I did intentionally.  It is a lot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact. Espionage is probably the only exception.) > Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send > to Canada if YOU have such a license and what is legal to send > if you don't.

Pass a law stating that if within a year of performaing a wiretap on someone a police agency hasn't managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for lost privacy. Of course there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of Clipper and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind an attempt to enforce it as a standard.

RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm developed by Ron Rivest \cite{rfc-md5} maps a message to a 128-bit message digest. Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a second.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved} secure MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps to a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$ operations and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision. Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's internal compression function which maps a 512-bit message block $x$ and a 128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output state. They show how to find a message block $x$ and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same output state: $f(xs_1)$ = $f(xs_2)$. Their well-thought approach exploits structural properties of the collision function to find a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations much less than one would expect. Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of MD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion'') a pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed a real collision since it involves two different messages would almost always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $f(x_1s_1) = f(x_2s_2)$ but the pseudocollisions have the same message blocks. Moreover the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would generally be unrelated but the pseudocollisions' input states are the same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the special pseudocollisions a limitation they readily admit. It is reasonable therefore to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in MD5 the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions and not anything approaching real collisions. Further research of course will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and other message-digest algorithms with the eventual hope that such algorithms can in some sense be proved secure. \bibliographystyle{plain} \begin{thebibliography}{1} \bibitem{den-boer-md5} Bert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers. \newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}. \newblock In {\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93} 1993. \newblock Preprint. \bibitem{rfc-md5} R.L.

"2","In article <strnlghtC5yBKA.Dp5@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid and the fact that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate. It's an important issue especially if one of the escrow agents decides they'd rather stop offering the service. I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government then the contract for providing escrow service would include some termination clause like returning the keys. >   The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. >   This makes the funding separate from government. But who's the user paying the fees here and what's the service? If the user is the government then the funding's not separate from the government. If the user is the buyer what's the service? Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need and won't buy their service! Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail! If the user is the manufacturer does the user have a choice about buying? The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it which is fine - I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key! Face it the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want. The only people who want it are the government not the users. What you're really talking about is either the government paying for the service up front or per-year either from general taxes or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips or on an indirect tax (forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.) I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from your serial number especially if the escrow is a government agency. Here in New Jersey we have lots of people willing to provide that sort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective. If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium there are people who will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee. Something could scratch the paint after all. And what a shame if your Clipper key got out! -- #				Pray for peace;      Bill # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ #	              No I'm *from* New Jersey I only *work* in cyberspace.... # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461"

Someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have continued access to our communications they already have it.  The problem is that yes the do have access and probably more than we realize.  The government wants exclusive access to communications intercept here in the united states cutting out other access detrimental to the national security (tm). I also doubt that a certain3 letter agency that originated the encryption algorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the escrow system to continue their intercept effort.

Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) ) This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this if the administration realised would probably scare them shitless. Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast* allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised we use tcp/ip streams and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags) As for me I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.

It is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. The announcement was silent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has been obtained (by the authorities by divorce lawyers by the Mafia by the FBI by lost or stolen backup tapes by the NSA etc.). all previous conversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated but knowing the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the security. No doubt more details will emerge.) So the loss of a key whether one is guilty or innocent may mean a lot more than merely replacing the phone. Sort of like saying to someone Oh I copied your diary. But I'll buy you a new one. And the system if made mandatory (as I expect) will make such storing of conversations much easier I fear. For one thing the transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone listening a kind of Caller ID and Callee ID on a grand scale. Also the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the privacy of the calls as they perceive them all to be useless encrypted junk. (This is a bit of a reach I know suggesting that the Clipper will make security more lax...).

The system may not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units but it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys from escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's coercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone. I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument. The original title perhaps should have been Distinction between legal and illegal cipher systems considered harmful but Clipper considered harmful is not inaccurate and is more eye-catching in the current context. Assumptions: 1.  Clipper is made available. 2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal (either on radio systems or on any common carrier system).  These laws also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum (or other medium) characterize signals validate Clipper wrappers detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers and make such detection a cause for further action. 3.  For escrowed keys to be useful some specific Clipper chip must be associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database. An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a red flag. 4.  To reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offers Clipper will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof and much less spoofable than today's cellphones. 5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that Clipper cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because each one has a unique unit key. 6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews) and because they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be detected they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise a red flag putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under immediate suspicion. 7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack discover family key F and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip. By #2 #3 #4 and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper phone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips around the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is associated with someone else. A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure communications at least for some limited time T if they buy beg borrow or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted communications might have been recorded and thus be retrievable later but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroying or abandoning the phone before T elapses. It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper phone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone else's bill and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion. This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion and collusion. Coercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk but also sometimes a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from a car parked in front of a store a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen from someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to arise in stolen Clipper phones with phones coming from risk-inured poor criminals and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage. The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of freshly coerced phones. There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminals and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper phone service for someone else's use. Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal cellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to their stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone and have its keys obtained from escrow. Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations but it cannot reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption unless it knows all unit keys which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces upon specific wiretap-like order. Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk recordings as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper chip is fractured. If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se then you can charge the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be using someone else's phone) but you'll have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow. The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more not less secure than they were before Clipper came along. I therefore consider Clipper harmful because: 1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government. 2.  If other ciphers are proscribed it engenders new types of direct criminal threat to the honest public. 3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to hide their use of some other cipher making it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress. 4.  If other ciphers are proscribed lazy investigators and prosecutors are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key escrow is claimed to help against. 5.  If other ciphers are proscribed the stage is set for witch hunting of illegal cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher machine...

"2","something that no one has discussed yet (or I missed it): The FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the court order was handed. Only at this point they can access the line and detect the serial number N. What happens next does the FBI simply asks for the keys for N and since a warrant was issued for the line the FBI simply gets it? What if multiple phones are used from the same house the FBI just asks for N1 N2 etc.? Exactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some other serial number X was also used over the wirtapped line and get the keys for X? Either a second court order (for the specific serial/key) is required (and I have seen no indication of this) or the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any time so the escrow key holders are a total fake. An unrelated issue: if and when all phones always use the clipper chip how are call-transfers going to take place?! Michael Golan mg@cs.princeton.edu"

"2","The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust issue.  Even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits) I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they are feeding into the system. S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they're not compromisable why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip. Nope it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access - the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use and ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything* on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours.

A society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever present.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia. As a matter of  principle  we  are  working  to  enact  formal legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on technical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the law requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g. require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power and invade privacy. As a  matter  of  practicality  I  do  not  think  your  system offers much hope for privacy.    First the trend toward universal identifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions. At best  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most would opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would never use or benefit from it. Finally where there's a  will there's  a  way. If  government wants to link data bases it  will  by  law require  the  disclosure of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it for data bases which the government wants to link.      Since corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one another they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted will use fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes used by their customers to other firms. The solution remains law policy and consensus about limits on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual autonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such consensus. Sincerely Yours /Sig/ Jerry J. Berman Chief Legislative Counsel & Direrector ACLU Privacy Technology Project cc: John Shattuck"

I can't answer all our questions in detail but I can take a stab at them. The form the operations that compute R1 R2 and R3 is of course the famous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with DES.  It's much stronger than a single encryption and has an effective key length of 160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first standardized a simple double encryption would not have the same strength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less the beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of very high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit that description. Why n_1 n_2 and n_3?  Well you need different plaintext values.  I have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess they're constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible. A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change -- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns and there might conceivably be a weakness.  So the n_i values are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming distance. In any event I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i from the U_i let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U they don't need to find S_i.  But even if they do they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In theory they should never even see those values even with a warrant.) The real question I think is why use this scheme at all as opposed to a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is *much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA NIST the ACLU the EFF and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number generator and that it passed every test you could think of.  When you come back next week to program some more chips does it still work that well?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been changed out from under you?  Does it still work well the in the presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards selecting 1 bits?  Yes you can run detailed statistical tests on it again but that's hard. Consider on the other hand a software solution.  You bring your own floppies with you you can run cryptographic checksums etc.  It's a lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged in other words. (Yes I can think of ways to cheat software too.  I think that they're a lot harder.) There are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer with one significant exception is yes.  I really do think that NSA and NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that their real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping under certain carefully-controlled circumstances with a minimum risk of abuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip on a programming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should be loaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don't claim my answer is obvious though I found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions section of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the scheme) I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and due process.  What would you do differently?  In answering this question please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap *some* domestic users is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue I present below.  Right here I'm discussing *just* the technical aspects.  And no I don't by any means claim that just because something can be done it should be.) The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually going to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't mean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the shipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests so that the escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry guys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have bought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no answer to this question and at the moment I don't see a way of answering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer to the final question below. The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law. I think that the answer is no but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reasons that I explained at great length on the net in the Elder Days and that I don't have the energy to repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some laws are necessary so long as they respect the essential rights of individuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our system -- the right to issue search warrants and while that power has certainly been abused it's also been used quite properly and fairly in other cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- but again it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians to answer of course since Clipper is completely alien to much of the rest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government a group I'm much more distant from.) --Steve Bellovin"

Don Alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to comp.risks.  I'll present my variant on it instead since I feel it's a bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the protocol that's followed for reading traffic.  Briefly the cops get a wiretap warrant and record the call.  They then notice the encryption and the disclosure header.  It along with a copy of their warrant is sent to the FBI or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The F-holder decrypts the header and sends the serial number N and the encrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They in turn use U1 and U2 to recover K and send that to the local police. Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the cops nor the FBI ever see U so they can't read other traffic.  Every request must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The cops and the FBI together can't cheat since they don't have U.  (I regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the system.  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.)  The escrow agents can't read the conversation since they don't have it; all they have is N and U[K].  And the police don't even see N. It's harder to see how to block decryption of old warrantless wiretaps.  There is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrow agents that the call is current.  But that's not nearly as strong. There are approaches I can see that might work involving sequences of data on an unalterable medium complete with cryptographic protection against insertion onto a new medium.  But I don't have anything yet that isn't too complex for comfort or too hard to install in the real world.  The NSA might have an answer; they may or may not be smarter than me but I've been working on this for a week and they've had years."
"2","Brad Yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a phone-clipper relationship. It doesn't wash. Recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect's phone calls. They do what they do now--figure out which lines to tap. They then record the stuff. If it's Clipper they read the law enforcement block extract the serial number and get the keys using the court order. No new difficulties (such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone line) are introduced that wouldn't have existed absent clipper. If the crooks were going to use a pay phone (say) they could have done so without clipper. If the government figures out they're so doing they listen in and if it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys. If the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line there's no problem. The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used just that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. They get the serial number get the keys and they are in business. No clipper chip to person association is ever needed. David -- David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted."

"2","I think it very unlikely there are back doors in clipper for two reasons: 1. The government doesn't need them if it can get the key (and yes I assume that the official government obeys court orders etc.--and that the design of the chip and its approval were official); 2. It would defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for American business that couldn't be read by our economic adversaries.

One thing I'm a bit puzzled by:  Why aren't they doing this with a public key scheme of some sort?  You could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor for each chip.  Then escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies.  Set the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys.

What would you do differently?  In answering this >question please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both >strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap >*some* domestic users is necessary. I'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument.  In my view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is secret leading to suspicion that there is a back door.  Without complete disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled no matter how many trusted experts are allowed to look at it in isolation. Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The only concern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build Clipperphones without registering the keys.  Assume F can really be kept secret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate that they both know F.  For example the initiating phone picks a number Q and sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F] and the initiator sends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a random 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial numbers of subsequent challenges.  This way Clipperphones will talk only to other Clipperphones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own proprietary Skipjack phone but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that they won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow. What's wrong with this picture?  It depends of F staying secret and on Skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis but the Government appears to believe in both of these.  Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has some flaw I imagine there's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't. smb says: >The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good >idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.

"2","There is a description of something called a fair crypto system in the May 1993 issue of BYTE p. 134 attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali. The way it works is as follows: You generate your private key S and break it up into pieces s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S. You give each piece s1 s2 etc. to a different escrow agency. The agencies each compute g^sn mod p and forward the result to the public key telephone book keeper. The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p reduces the result to mod p and this will be the user's public key. Now if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies and the user could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted the result would be something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system. I still don't think key escrow is a good idea for both philosophical and security reasons but I do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good faith or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected for spinelessness in the face of official requests."

Yeah but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested mistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law enforcement agency *does* make a chip::person association? I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records (e.g. encode the serial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit card info voila.) At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or whatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person likely is in your house etc.) plus or minus some shenanigans of course. But I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id recording the conversation then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes up as owner of that id (mistakenly maybe you sold the phone at a garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) They might only know who one side of the conversation is for example. Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such databases loses two points. First law enforcement agencies can of course do this. Second they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any money for it. The IRS for example does do this anyhow. They just don't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess. Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like mastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.) I know an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen I could hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during a dispute I had with them (to intimidate me actually not much of a dispute I didn't particularly disagree but for some reason this fellow wanted to play tough guy with me I hope he's better now.)

As I read the current wiretap law it would not be legal now.  On the other hand assuming a legislative change recording but not decrypting Clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme Court using the same reasoning (or the lack thereof...) by which they permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers. Incidentally if we use that as our model the Court will likely not uphold selective recording.  (On the other hand I don't think they've thrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet.  Must be that exception to the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of Rights.) A lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how Clippertaps (or Tipperclaps for encrypted music?) are used.  Don Alvarez showed in the latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from reading traffic after their warrant expires. That is -- the cops send the LEF to the F-holder.  The F-holder strips off F and sends U[K]N to the escrow agents.  They send either U or K to the cops.  (Don says U I say K.)  The cops can't use U in the future because they can't strip off F.  The F-holder never sees U.  In Don's model the escrow agents can't read the traffic because they don't have K; in my model they have K but not the message itself. And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI (the F-holder) are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules.  The net result is that by involving the F-holder and the escrow agents on every tap we can avoid extending permission to tap."

David While I disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government I think you have a good idea here. There is danger that with funding coming from asset forfeitures the government could continue to promulgate a bad product in spite of poor acceptance.

My interpretation of Denning's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300- chip programming session.  I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some people have envisioned. My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the S1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkable way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers used to generate the keys.  Since we have to trust the escrow companies anyway it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from random seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm for key-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an agent could challenge the procedure ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed and run his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is what is actually being put onto the floppies. And yes there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could be hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each time.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by the trusted escrow agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be recovered.  Heck each chip could be recorded with the same U ignoring what was on the floppy. Hal Finney"

The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from Friedman: No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes from someone who has already broken a very hard one. Historically Friedman has been right.  It's really hard to develop a good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer the precursor to DES turns out to have been fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries at public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Most if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were broken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption have been disappointing; the classic A survey of data insecurity packages in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the popular security packages of the late 1980s. A new proprietary algorithm?  No way. If the US is permitting general export of this thing it has to be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently there's a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be no problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms (I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported. I can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out. John Nagle p.s.

Read >Bamford's THE PUZZLE PALACE. I did.  You're mistaken.  NSA's communications intelligence mission is strictly against foreign governments.  Here's an excerpt from the enabling charter (24 Oct 52 Truman) that should clarify this.  The charter was declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public.  Mind you I don't know that they never collect anything they're not supposed to... but spying on US citizens isn't in their charter. b. The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency (NSA) shall be to provide an effective  unified organization and control of the communications  intelligence activities of the United States  conducted against foreign  governments to provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures pertaining thereto.   As  used in  this directive  the terms communications intelligence  or COMINT shall be construed to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such communications by other  than intended recipients  but shall exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of finished intelligence. They're also tasked with protecting the US's communications but I haven't seen the specific enabling memo on that.  I assume that's the role under which Skipjack was developed.

This is *definitely* worth >working on folks.  And shorten works in well under real-time. I don't think that this should be worked on just in the context of cryptography. That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts of people. What's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone quality speech<->RS232 converter. Imagine if you will a little box that takes data on its serial port and puts out sound and takes sound and codes it to signals on its serial port. Full duplex. Now this device is not a cryptographic device. It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever you want to call it. It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications for: a) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples) b) speech recording for electronic messaging c) building voicemail systems d) internet talk radio e) internet relay chat Of course some of the electronic messaging in item b might be encrypted possibly realtime but that's the user's decision. One would need 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout to switch over and some code on say a 486 laptop. I'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive internet talk radio could be done. Ideally though it should be a general purpose device. It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody should be able to balk at its widespread use. Obviously to make it easy for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware. It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple of folks about building such a thing before this whole clipper thing started. I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are able to make sample units given incentive and some time. I'd envisioned finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund development of a public domain board layout and parts set that could be published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD packages and in PostScript. Anyone interested? I'll start a provisional mailing list. Let me know if you want on. mjr."

Okay it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all. During the Vietnam war there were a great many citizens opposed to it who considered themselves perfectly law abiding although Mr. Nixon and his lackeys thought otherwise. The Federal government had no compunction about adding people who are otherwise decent law abiding and upstanding but disagree with us to your nice little list. Do you think this could never happen again? Note that I am not speculating about what the government could do but discussing the sort of observation - including but not limited to phone tapping - that the government put its citizens under during a time of national tension. Your naivete is still appalling BTW. I mean read what you posted again. How are we to differentiate between Good People and Bad People? Answer: A priori we can't; we have to assume. Now which way do we assume? Do we assume a priori that a citizen is law-abiding or rather a potential CommunistDrugLordChildAbuserCultMessiah?

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform real-time full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today's modems. This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate) encrypts it with DES then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device.  The compressed encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s (!). My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity (audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember though that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved. The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young's DES implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

Brown Secretary Department of Commerce 14th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington DC 20236 Dear Secretary Brown: As you know I have long been interested in the privacy and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption standard based upon clipper chip technology have raised a number of related issues.  The international competitiveness of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is a key factor that the government should consider when addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the nation moves forward in developing the national communications and information infrastructure security of telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of users. The hacker community can compromise the integrity of telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the network.  The people and businesses that use the nation's telecommunications network and the personal computers linked through it increasingly are demanding that information be protected against unauthorized access alteration and theft. I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean that to remain competitive internationally U.S. companies would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. government customers and another for private commercial users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis of this issue please respond to the following questions: 1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA NIST or the vendor?  If so please identify such entities and the nature of testing performed.  If not please describe any plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how such experts will be chosen. 2. Under the Administration's plan what entities will be the holders of the keys to decrypt scrambled data?  What procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to designate such key holders? 3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the Administration contain a trap door or back door which could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to crack the code? 4. It is clear that over time changes in technologies used for communications will require new techniques and additional equipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid advancement of telecommunications technology? 5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place on the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard in their equipment? 6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the clipper chip technology on U.S. exports of computer and telecommunications hardware and software products? I would appreciate your response by no later than close- of-business Wednesday April 28 1993.

"2","I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper level routines into a single data link. The upper levels won't know about this and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at the initial link establishment). I figure that I can do this with DES and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Is using a Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key acceptable in other words what are the pro's and con's of such a setup? Are there any important issues to watch out for (aside from filtering out unacceptable keys)? And in order to achieve this I guess I will need to use 64bit math routines (for probable prime number calculation exponentiation etc) so could someone point me towards a good package (this is strictly non-commercial).

Why don't we move down even further toward the masses by setting this up on an IBM PC clone(probably needs to be a 386 or a 486) with a sound blaster and a V.32bis modem.  Those components are very widely available.  I don't know if the PC has enough horsepower to encrypt the data at realtime but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will work at any sampling rate from 4KHz to 23 KHz.

I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any problem. Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The description turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one. We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely expensive as the military Tempest kit but which was well enough shielded to stop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype it works and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero. In the absence of open standards a monitor which really is `low radiation' (and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the pretty blue sticker on the box).

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  For example the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian Federal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes a report describing it and some of the legislative history including concerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically charged with running the National Computer Security Center  -- to quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private sector use.'' It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this but I'm pretty sure it's legal.  (Btw -- when it comes to development of cryptosystems there may be two choices.  Either NSA helped develop it in which case maybe they can crack it maybe not but probably no one else can; or NSA didn't help in which case they probably can crack it and maybe others as well...)"

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words it essentially turns the output block into a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode however only the one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block and all that follow it will be decrypted properly. It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely. - Todd"

I have >not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been >reported but I could have easily missed it. Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality of other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seen have been weasel-words (more plans in the future etc) but nothing that could be taken as a NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed).  I have heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has language that either requires escrow of keys or that will regard all systems 'unapproved' for public use like strong cryptosystems not trivially broken by the Govt or without escrowed keys which one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by folks with 'special' connections or government agencies) as either 'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY but by added Civil Forfeiture powers and clever wording EFFECTIVELY outlawed for all intents and purposes. Now for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care hit 'n' now. Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY outlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example a crowbar hammers screwdrivers and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much at the whim of the authorities based primarily on the individual possessing them in the car etc. not being in a trade that makes routine use of these tools.  In a like manner one who has no 'legitimate need' (gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems and is caught using them might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'. In other words if one is not working for a corporation with extremely sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong security or a government agency and securing only work-related data not personal data one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd. A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as a 'legitimate NEED': Why do you want such strong security especially from 'legitimate law enforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE HMMMM? I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at random or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of 'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about this... (mega ':-('s) One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an argument used in the abortion debate):  You do NOT have a right to have security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break' (as suggested in the Clipper Press Release). This in a nutshell is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only for crypto systems as in this case but for the precident it will set laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both safe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately owned safes and so on.  WHY NOT?)... I cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those 'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily declared unconstitutional if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A simple policy decision just like so many of the gun regulations are mainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents would go something like: We are gonna seize your home your computers your car your bank account (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes unless you have a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your acquisition transport and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers tools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism ya unnerstand... no decent American Subject would be against these noble causes.... Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying your HOME COMPUTERS CAR BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing SOMEHOW - they housed transported and funded these 'terrorist tools'. Only a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>. Therefore the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT apply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>. If you wish to deposit a BOND hire some attorneys and go to court to PROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools' and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools') go ahead we have no problem with that!  'Course with your bank assets seized no car computer or home (probably no job too) and your less-than-limitless resources you might run into some minor practical difficulties <grin>.... THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been used to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on the property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in that dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for dealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk to bust another day and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets... Ob Disclaimer (of course)... Ok note that I am not a lawyer and can only base these speculations on what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture cases and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone or who do not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where they are denied either meaningful police protection AND the means to be able to even pretend to defend themselves as is quite common back East like NJ MA NYC Wa DC or out West in CA).  These people have the choice of cowering under the government boot or cowering under threats of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case... All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain or behind the Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't take a lot to check to see if that is correct. Depends on whether the filler is a constant (makes checking easy but susceptible to replay) or variable (e.g. timer counter random) which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the inquisitors to know if they've missed messages or gotten them out of sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about. It is still easy to conceal super-encryption at least until the inquisitors get ahold of the K key which can take a while presumably not in near-real-time.

If it isn't at one of the receiptants location forget encryption at all.  You have blown any security you thought you might have had. Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are military (or equivalent like CIA and other embassy personnel) so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal - it's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade and the secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors because they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.) That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob; most people don't use sound-proof vaults and may use bridges in their PBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance or value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges). If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones the conferencing aspects don't change.  But there may be a market niche for trusted conference-bridge providers though I suppose the inquisitors would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges just in case a Bad Guy might use the service. -- #				Pray for peace;      Bill # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ #	              No I'm *from* New Jersey I only *work* in cyberspace.... # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461"

"2","Sorry my news reader doesn't seem to know how to copy a subject header. This tracks the thread why people don't need strong crypto..... The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expressly forbids *thinking* about building nuclear devices.  While I was in grad school a friend of mine got a security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine. He found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the local engineering library (Madison Wisconsin).  So the lawyers sent him all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in the article was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a local underground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been precensored by the feds that's what this was all about) so the judge declared the case moot. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court.  From my discussions with several people familiar with the case only 2 other times has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out. For all intents and purposes the government *does* have precidence for declaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I was working on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works and I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enough to classify so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from Canada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping cross sections but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed to present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an open journal without problems. When the going gets wierd the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whatever they want whenever they feel like it and they will make up rules to let themselves get away with it.  Since the mass media can't tell the difference between a joke and the real thing (like ranch appocolypse for the Waco massacre) don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss of freedom.  The government *can* make strong crypto illegal.  SO WHAT? Since the government does not obey any of its own rules why should we?

OK Steve here's a sketch of an alternative that I believe addresses most of the objections to the Clipper scheme. Notation: +	concatenation ^	exclusive or E(MK)	message M encrypted by key K D(MK)	message M decrypted by key K H(M)	hash (digest/signature) of message M Important Values: U0[X]		local chip unit key from escrow agency X U1[X]		remote chip unit key from escrow agency X N[0]		serial number of the local chip N[1]		serial number of the remote chip A		number of escrow agencies K[0]K[1]	session keys agreed upon external to this protocol F		family key need not be secret Protocol: Choose K0[1]...K0[A] such that K[0] = K0[1]^...^K0[A] Remote chip does same for K[1]K1[1]...K1[A]. Compute the following: L0[1] = E(K0[1] U0[1]) ... L0[A] = E(K0[A] U0[A]) L[0] = N[0] + E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A] F) Remote chip does the same for L1[1]...L1[A]L[1] Send L[0] to remote chip and receive L[1] from remote chip Compute: KE[0] = H(K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A] + K[1] + D(L[1] F) KD[0] = H(K[1] + D(L[1] F) + K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A] Note that D(L[1] F) = N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A] Remote chip does the same for KE[1] and KD[1] User data is encrypted (decrypted) with keys KE[0] KE[1] (KD[0] KD[1]) Assumptions: No trap doors in E() D() and H(). H() is not invertible. Algorithms for E() D() and H() are secret. Otherwise a software implementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip. The chip only supports the following operation: 1)  Return N[0] 2)  Load K0[x] 3)  Return E(K0[x] U0[x]) 4)  Return E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A] F) 5)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A] F) return N[1]L1[1]...L1[A] 6)  Load K[1] 7)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A] F) compute KE[0] KD[0] 8)  Given M return E(M KE[0]) 9)  Given M return D(M KD[0]) Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying the chip (U[1]...U[A]FN[0]). U[1]...U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip. (Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it's possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.) The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies. Notes: For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0] E(K0[Y] U0[Y]) N[1] E(K1[Y] U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y] K1[Y]. LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies to record that both chips were tapped. LEA's only get the session key not the key to all conversations of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a conversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements. Observation: In order for any secure by tap-able communication scheme to work the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is revealed communications by those that know the secret can be made un-tap-able. Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm and the master (family) key. Relative size and complexity suggests that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the scheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm. rsbx ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Raymond S.

Yes but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message is encrypted by the Clipper so that the wrapper would be fine the phone's serial number and the session key would be in the law-enforcement field etc. but the message wouldn't be readable even if the particular Clipper's key were obtained from the escrow agents.

I was under the impression (from reading Denning's description of the Clipper's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for encrypting the message text but that each chip uses it's own key for encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field.

Why? Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily availble. Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret he was bullshitting you. Now it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of the Kerberos protocol. For instance using a weak RNG to generate keys might cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the other kind who's name I can't remember). However this is not what was claimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES which is not known to exist in the open literature. Don't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be.

My understanding of the current process that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed by retiree volunteers who match the message against message profiles and check the message count.

If that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify or refute this? Yes that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic it's just listening to any available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques you know to separate out the interesting stuff. The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of signal so they're easy to detect and if you do your sync carefully you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse. In both cases it's especially nice because it gets you the data the user is looking at rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is paging out to disk etc. With newer quieter equipment there isn't as much signal and it's harder to isolate the fun parts.

My thought Airline pilots lately have been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's instruments.  If this can be hyped up manufacturers may start building laptops with even lower emmisions.

"2","Gentlefolk It seems to me that the Step 1 of taking a warrant to the telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (don't you love animal metaphors). With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip (E(N;F) is not syntactically different than N) all they have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of today's target and use the serial number to identify the session they want and get the chip number of the other end of the conversation. Even without the key this is great for traffic analysis. I can think of several ways to learn the right serial number. It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your alligator clips erect). This is particularly handy if you have S1 and S2. BTW did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial number?

Unlike me he thinks that our friends in the US enjoy the same freedom that we do and he has not seen the slow but steady erosion to the south of us. We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any time they actually go after somebody just because they don't like his or her attitude it's national news (It also often blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed Zundel case which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme Court not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under). Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we have agencies and some of them have teeth. They also have the War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop fighting each other long enough to do any really effective suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that our Police Commissions have teeth as I learned when I had to fend off a bent cop. It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order while the nation founded on Peace Order and Good Government is getting in-your-face liberty.

"2","Hmmm.... CELP takes up about 12.6 MIPS for full duplex and has been implemented on about a million DSP chips... the 56001 card in my PC only cost about $700 and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop. The Analog Devices 21020 board that we're looking at now cost about $500 (academic price). I don't think hardware is something to worry about... if you get it working people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow. What we need here is a good implementation of CELP (the government code is absolute crap I got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours) and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit frames every 30msec... I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS). As part of the project I'm working on now we're trying to get CELP up and running in realtime full duplex mode... I gotta find the source to pgp and see how tough it would be to integrate the en/decryption parts into the code. I'll play with it.

"2","In order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography policies are acceptable we must set forth a list of basic requirements. I would propose the following as a starting point: 1. The algorithm must be publicly known and must have a record of surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses. 2. The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the advertised algorithm is in fact the one that is being used. 3. The key must be quickly changeable by the user and must be of a sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search possible now or in the reasonably near future. Note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key escrow system; the May 1993 issue of Byte describes an example of an encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be escrowed in order to have one's public key listed by a central distributor."

I'd use a secret (nope obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the 30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy replaced the L.E. block by random data. And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting faulty plaintext you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own safety ;-(. The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol. So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks than those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the algorithms (and protocols) remain secret. Personally I doubt they will. -- Detlef Lannert       DC3EK       E-Mail: tsos@rz.uni-duesseldorf.de PGP 2.2 key via server or finger lannert@clio.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de I am Psmith. - Oh you're Smith are you? - With a preliminary P.

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words it essentially turns the output block into a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode however only the one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block and all that follow it will be decrypted properly. It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely. - Todd -------------------------------------------------------------------- From: pausch@saaf.se (Paul Schlyter) In article <ad.735831059@cat> you write: >Hello > >how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors?

How much data per bit will be lost in average (I assume you still have the correct key)? It depends on the mode you're using DES in. Electronic Code Book (ECB) takes a block of 64 input bits and produces 64 output bits so if any bits are changed the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad. I forget which feedback mode is which. In all of them the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks. With some modes the system self-synchronizes so errors are repaired in a few blocks.  With other modes once one block is bad all later blocks will be bad too. There's also the framing problem.  If you have a bit change the block that it's in changes and maybe later blocks also change. But if you have bits lost or bits added (64 bits in 63 or 65 bits out) everything is confused after that. -------------------------------------------------------------------- From: Marcus J Ranum <mjr@TIS.COM> depends on the mode you're using. cfb for example synchronises pretty fast. figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the next one. mjr. -------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Experience is what you get if you don't get what you want...

Big deal. If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a legitimate wiretap order you just listen in on the line for 10 minutes get the serial number and then take the order and go to the escrow agencies. If you notice the criminal is now using a different phone instrument take your still-valid wiretap order to the escrow agency with the new serial number. (This provides opportunities for abuse by law enforcement but thats not what we are discussing right now.) I oppose Clipper but the mechanics here are simple and easy to understand. The whole rest of your article is based on a large series of false premises all predicated on the notion that this simple act is somehow impossible.

"2","The *security* of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys. The ability to tap is an inherent *insecurity* which depends fundamentally on the secrecy of the algorithm.  To spell it out because so many people seem to miss the point if the algorithm were published anyone could create a chip which would work correctly with the Skipjack chips but which would not have its key registered. I believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the government maintaining a secret of some kind.  For example the secret could be the private keys of the escrow agencies; their digital signatures would be required before a key could be used.  In this case the NSA/NIST/whoever has decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier/cheaper/more secure than other possible protocols. -- Kian-Tat Lim (ktl@wag.caltech.edu GEnie: K.LIM1) Materials & Molecular Simulation Center Caltech Henry Spencer left-of-| Margaret * Puckette signature fan"

"2","May I suggest that any any proposed cipher system having less entropy than the user's key and message can have an embedded subliminal channel as big as the difference in entropies between the entropy of the user input (message) and the entropy of the output? For example take plain DES.  The unsuspecting user inputs a string PLAINTEXT to be enciphered. He cranks the algorithm which has been hacked by George Quisling and comes out with j*3H4902d. Nine char in and nine chars out.  Right? The unsepecting user ships the ciphertext to be decrpyted and the message PLAINTEXT is produced.  Everything fine right?  Nope. Imagine the algorithm did a LZ compression on PLAINTEXT before DESing. (Compressing is down to four characters with more entropy: 9#wj The opponent now pads the message with his own message also compressed *3dk@ before applying DES to the concatenated compressed pairs.  When decrpyted the first compressed message is stripped off and declared sent.  Unbeknowst to the receiver the opponents accomplice collects the remaining message in the bit bucket and uncompresses to KILL NOW. And to prevent all such subliminal or covert storage channels you would need to have maximal entropy all the time -- which is a priori impossible because (for example) a stereotypical message might be replaced by one bit in the output reserving the rest of the output bits for the long covert message. In other words if you opponent get to muck with the algorithm -- you either have got to muck with it LAST or concede his possible embedding of covert channels. In other words if you present a message to an opponet with less than maximal entropy then you have given him free bits of storage. -- grady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F"

I speculate from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78 that the algorithm is a classified cryptosystem similar in application to DES but cleared by the NSA for classified traffic that has been in use for a number of years. Myktotronx refers to it as Government Type II encryption which matches the designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called CIPHER2. This would make sense since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem which can act as a pin-compatible substitute for DES.  Combined with a tappable key exchange protocol this would offer exactly what is claimed for Clipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow.  If this is fact the case it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself. Now I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :) it's nonexistent.  However it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES (and which is at least as secure) set up a key escrow scheme for law enforcement and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx who's been around but almost invisible for years. Has anyone else made this sort of connection or am I just hallucinating pink elephants here? :).

Seems to me that encryption ought to be covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning the government shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting one's freedom of speech.  In other words encrypted data---text graphics or other information---is just another form of free speech. For this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use of encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time the government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data in question may be something that isn't protected by the first amendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this the government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing someone into revealing the keys. BTW what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art nowdays.  Have the feds relaxed export restrictions on DES yet?

"2","I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed an interesting omission from the discussion. You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software. The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips and reverse engineer it? I mean take the thing to a chip testing/ analysis facility one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron microcope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips that we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually find the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was. I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities and that the potential is there especially at a university where the security at such a facility is looser for someone to take a clipper apart and analyze it? What can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes?? mark"

Dear Senator/Congressman/President {fill in the blank} I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's Clipper Chip initiative. This proposal to establish a secret government designed cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice encryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret is patently unAmerican. Additionally the press release for this program strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment is avalible the criminals drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott understand my objection to key registration consider the way J. Edgar Hoover blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to? ______________________________________________________________________________ Well heres a letter I didnt spell check it since I dont know how in EMACS so you might want to do that.

Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative publications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand. Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment with the usual trade journals all they ever see is the media (note: media in this context is the popular media - TV radio daily newspapers and such publications as Time Newsweek and all that).  And they all say pretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range of center-left to far Left and generally supportive of pie-in-sky we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seems to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them (as with Clipper for example) or tells the people how to interpret events in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information about them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be clarirvoyant.  For example I would have been unaware of Clipper had I not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET let alone Internet access? For access to better publications the person has to spend time digging. Many folks especially who work long hours have families etc. do not have TIME to go digging and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right just saying that is the way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't TOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the problem. And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service (bureaucrats politicians) that act as if the person without political connections or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if any rights being a resource to be used by those in control for their polticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD and get very nasty when someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors etc tend to fall into those with privilege and tend to not be upset by the current state of affairs.  The fellow in DC who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi for daring to swim in it with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law he pushed to be foisted on everyone else) ends up walking where a less well-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example of one standard for 'us' a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'. Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this but the solution sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is going on or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position where one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite of a journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-than complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the media.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views on the subject and it involved a 'brother' journalist. Isn't it time for our 'objective' media the MAIN SOURCE of info for the average person to start being what they claim to be instead of spin doctors for the Statist elements? >-- >Rahul Dhesi <dhesi@rahul.net> >also:  dhesi@cirrus.com -- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle WA If all else fails try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat WISDOM: Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about the former.              - Albert Einstien"

"2","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Please note that the following speech was made by Chuck Hammill in 1987.  Address all letters to his address given at the end of this document. -- Russell FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA TECHNOLOGY Given at the Future of Freedom Conference November 1987 You   know   technology--and   particularly   computer technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir- cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984 or Terry Gilliam's Brazil  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's slave/citizens on their own side of the border or  the  so- phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on his enemies list.  Or we recognize that for the price  of a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by a  government  policeman and permit him to paw thru our be- longings if it beeps. But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for eavesdropping governments used binoculars and  lip-readers. Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress the evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools. In fact technology represents one of the most  promis- ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen them.  By its very nature  it  favors the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can- not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the merit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time- tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de- scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish? One  of  the  clearest  classic triumphs of technology over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable crossbow.   With it an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if that  target  were  a mounted chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike the longbow which admittedly was more powerful and  could get  off  more shots per unit time the crossbow required no formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required elaborate  visual  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder  of  a  crossbow could simply put the weapon to his shoulder sight along the arrow  itself and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar- get.) Moreover since just about  the  only  mounted  knights likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government soldiers and tax collectors the utility of the  device  was plain:    With it the common rabble could defend themselves not only against one another but against their governmental masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor- piercing  bullet  and consequently kings and priests (the medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol  Tobacco  and Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication respec- tively for its unlawful possession. Looking at later developments we  see  how  technology like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the handgun later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45 called the equalizer.  A frail dance-hall hostess with one in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise- ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  a  man  on horseback  armed with one of these rifles simply cannot be captured.  And as long as his captors  were  relying  upon flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles the quote is doubtless a true one. Updating now to  the  present  the  public-key  cipher (with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv- alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's own possession but it can also permit two strangers to  ex- change   information   over   an   insecure   communications channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line   for   example   or skywriting for that matter)--without ever having previously met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com- puter you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi- cations; soon after that full-color digitized video images. Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete  it will  have  totally demolished government's control over in- formation transfer. I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat- ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is called the RSA algorithm after Rivest Shamir and  Adleman who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact that if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very large  primes  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    Ex- tremely  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100 digits apiece then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen- eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful computer now in existence. The  public part of the key consists of (1) the prod- uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q and (2)  one  fac- tor  call it  x   of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) * (q-1) + 1}.  The private part of the key consists  of  the other factor  y. Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned into an integer--either by using ASCII  or  even  a  simple A=01  B=02  C=03 ...  Z=26 representation.  This integer is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y (modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always yield the original number started with. What makes this a groundbreaking development  and  why it  is  called  public-key  cryptography  is  that I can openly publish the product  pq and the number   x     while keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me an encrypted message namely x a    (mod pq)   but only I can recover the original message  a   by  taking what  they  send raising it to the power  y  and taking the result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet may  still  reliably  ex- change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and disseminated his own  pq  and his  x     while  maintaining the secrecy of his own  y. Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a dig- ital signature to enable one to authenticate the source of a given message.  Normally if I want to send you a message I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod your pq)  and send that. However  if in my message I take the plaintext  a and raise it to my (secret) power  y   take the result  (mod my pq) then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and send this then even after you have normally decrypted the message  it  will still look like garbage.  However if you then raise it to my public power x    and take  the  result (mod  my public pq  ) so you will not only recover the ori- ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but I could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret y). And these are the very concerns by the way that are to- day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of personal  computers.    On the one hand they recognize that American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com- puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so in fact because there are things computers can do  which  will interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre- cisely these students who one generation hence will be going head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning ballistics.    On  the  other hand whatever else a personal computer may be it is also an exquisitely efficient copying machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50000 words  of text  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this weren't threatening enough the computer that  performs  the copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac- cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten- sively than machine guns are in the United States.) Now  the  conservative position is that we should not sell these computers to the Soviets because they could  use them  in weapons systems.  The liberal position is that we should sell them in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and cooperation--and  anyway  if  we don't make the sale there will certainly be some other nation willing to. For my part I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian position should be to give them to the Soviets for free and if  necessary make them take them . . . and if that doesn't work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub- scription of course not taxation . . . I confess that this is not a position that has gained much support among members of  the conventional left-right political spectrum but af- ter all in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters we are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a particular  goal may not look anything like what most people would consider a straight line.    Taking  a  long  enough world-view  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern- ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missiles aimed at Moscow. But  there's  the rub:  A long enough world view does suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and  the simply  stupid  will get what they deserve but what's not immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being killed enslaved or pauperized in the process. When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at- tack freedom they possessed a reasonably  stable  healthy functioning economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now  we  have patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  feed  the  poor while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub- sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in- crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years ago.  When the price went up  we  were  told  the  economy risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase was called the moral equivalent of war and the Feds  swung into  action.    For the first time in American history the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be- came an issue of Federal concern.   Now when the  price  of oil  drops again we risk problems this time because Ameri- can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has lowered via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did what  can we call this except the moral equivalent of civil war--the government against its own people? And classically in international trade can you imag- ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be compelled by the court to raise its prices but also that it be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place? So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there exists  almost  a  black  hole  effect in the evolution of nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free- dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent  the  state warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen in the area of so-called welfare payments.  When those who sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those whose taxes must replenish the trough  then  what  possible choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak- ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go down to the nearest welfare office find just  two  people on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor. So essentially those who love liberty need an edge of some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi- ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  other-directedness  of work  slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world. Recognize  that however immoral such an appeal might be it is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture. If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a cause caring only enough for their personal welfare so as to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy to draw from.  Equally clearly this is just the sort of ap- peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight and say something like Listen follow me as I enunciate my noble cause contribute your money to support the cause give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the cause strive selflessly to bring it about and then (after you  and  your children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu- ally  live under egoism--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if when and as individual libertarians and/or egoists find it profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only then. While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli- tical  action I don't believe that it is the only nor even necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing freedom  in  our time.  Consider that for a fraction of the investment in time money and effort I might expend in  try- ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in- terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them unilaterally. There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to the Eskimoes which very likely most Libertarians  have  al- ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with the saying you might well feel that you've heard  it  often enough already and that it has nothing further to teach us and moreover that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I shall therefore repeat it now: If you give a man a fish the saying runs you feed him for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish you feed him for a lifetime. Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of a  workfare  vs.  welfare  context;  namely that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him how to earn his sustenance not simply how to  beg  for  it. And of course this is true if only because the next time he is hungry there might not be anybody around willing or even able to give him a fish whereas with the information on how to fish he is completely self sufficient. But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order content of the quote and if there were nothing  further  to glean  from  it  I would have wasted your time by citing it again.  After all it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist slant as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac- tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry beggars as we may encounter. But consider: Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish  but  he does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You on the other hand have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things and they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information bartering fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well  the  first thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise that  every  trade  must  have a winner and a loser; the idea that if one person gains it must necessarily be at the expense of another person who loses.  Clearly under  this scenario such is not the case.  Each party has gained some- thing  he  did  not have before and neither has been dimin- ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information (rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  law  of diminishing   returns   the  first  and  second  laws  of thermodynamics--all those laws which constrain our possi- bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's anarchy! Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish contain dangerous tiny bones and sometimes sharp spines he tells us the state has decreed that their  consumption--and even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable  willing adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought to be government property and therefore it is the  function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern- ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener- ously extends to competent adults the benefits it provides to children and to the mentally ill:  namely  a  full-time all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior thought physically risky or morally naughty.  But in  any case  you  stare stupefied while your Eskimo informant re- lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of pos- session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute. Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far- ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion- ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be altruistic  in the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed  or egoistic in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per- haps even other motives.) But since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to your cause you're not about to mount a military campaign or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade. However it is here that technology--and in  particular  in- formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a hundredfold.    I say literally because for a fraction of the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to smuggling in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar- geted government like present-day America at least permits open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re- stricted  then that should suffice.  But if the government attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well  then you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id- eological  adversaries or even trying to win over the unde- cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  Freedom  in  an Unfree World that the success of any endeavor is in general inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua- sion is necessary to its fulfilment. If  you  look  at  history you cannot deny that it has been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington Lincoln  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . . Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped by  people with names like Edison Curie Marconi Tesla and Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per- vasive and not nearly so bloody. And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en- slave plunder or constrain us I propose a libertarian net- work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize freedom for ourselves. But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government wants to spy on you there is no guarantee of what  the  fu- ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced for exam- ple which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor when government wants to shoot you.  That is if you were to commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest then that fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own. This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but it does indicate how government thinks. Other  technological  applications  however do indeed pose legal risks.  We recognize for  example  that  anyone who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the underground railroad was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as the sovereign government of the United States of America  at that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi- larly during Prohibition anyone who used  his  bathtub  to ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug alcohol--the controlled substance wine--was using  technol- ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents for his crime--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this drug. So . . . to quote a former President  un-indicted  co- conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . Let me make one thing perfectly clear:  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate participate  in or conspire in the violation of any law--no matter how oppressive  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa- tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological processes  and some of these processes (like flying a plane or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li- censing to perform legally.    Fortunately  no  license  is needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it- self. So the next time you look at the political  scene  and despair  thinking  Well  if 51% of the nation and 51% of this State and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian before  I'll  be  free  then  somebody might as well cut my goddamn throat now and put me out of my  misery--recognize that  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your- self free. If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake name  and  mail  drop for that matter--and you'll go on the mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self- addressed envelopes since my printer can handle mailing la- bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you should have an idea to share or even a  useful  product  to plug  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication. Even if you want to be the proverbial free rider and  just benefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome: Everything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or give it away (or sell it for that matter 'cause if you can get  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to give it away you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist profit . . .)  Anyway every application of these principles should make the world just a little freer and I'm certainly willing to underwrite that at least for the forseeable  fu- ture. I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they outlaw  swords  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before they outlaw plowshares too. --Chuck Hammill THE LIBERTECH PROJECT 3194 Queensbury Drive Los Angeles California 90064 310-836-4157 hammill@netcom.com [The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992 with the permission of Chuck Hammill by Russell Whitaker] Those interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate in at least these newsgroups: alt.privacy alt.security.pgp comp.org.eff.talk sci.crypt A copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program PGP 2.1 (Pretty Good Privacy) can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.

Unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector essentially doesn't give any additional security. I got 3 answers (from grady@netcom.com Mark.Lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk smb@research.att.com) that opened my eyes. It's pretty simple: Say E is encryption (and D decryption) with key K on 64-bit blocks. Let c[0] be the initialisation vector m[1] m[2] ... the message blocks c[1] c[2] ... the cipher text blocks. Then encryption in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode works by the formula c[i] = E(m[i] XOR c[i-1]) and decryption by m[i] = c[i-1] XOR D(c[i]). So if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message block m[1]. But she can do her key search attack on m[2] m[3] ... The situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-) Finally there is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0] and encryption is given by c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i]. Here the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers reduces the cracking to key search for K. -- Klaus Pommerening Institut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitaet Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69 W-6500 Mainz Germany"

Quite simply she says that the security should not DEPEND on the secrecy of the algorithm.  A secret algorithm can still be secure after all we just don't know it.  Only our level of trust is affected not the security of the system. The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know which we believe to be secure. They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security.  They want to protect its market share. If they publish the algorithm then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow.  And of course everybody would buy them. The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules they get us to follow their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail. Quite simply with Clipper established it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard to make phones that can't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds for 99% of the populace. To get untappable crypto you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one. That's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using its very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new technologies to control this one in a way they like. It's almost admirably clever.  When the EFF started I posed the question here What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they can't wiretap? and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it was much of a question) Then came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills which we fought. Now we have their real answer the cleverest of all. -- Brad Templeton ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale CA 408/296-0366"

Shearer I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However using the info they gather while listening they can go searching THE right place and find good strong evidence which they can use in court. Question : currently it is easy to wire-tap from the technical point of view at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police also obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ). The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things. If an illegal operation is really worth one can afford having critical data carried by a person rather than sending it electronically. The clipper chip will not change this. The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own police following their OWN law not the US law. i.e. each country will have its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic? or will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there be an international escrow some kind of U.N. thing ? Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next years. I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the risk of  for instance one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ? I think so if its cost is limited I think that many privacy invasions are done not only by official services but also by private entities. The clipper can help reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it it is not a real danger and it can be helpful. Ph. HOOGVORST"

For instance in the system outlined in the May 1993 issue of Byte the process of getting one's public key listed for general use involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies which do calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of the public key directory which combines these results into your listed public key.  If you try to give the escrow agencies pieces which -don't- yield your private key when they are all put together the result is that the public key listed for you is wrong and you can't read messages encrypted to you."

They're too visible and have too much to lose. The US government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its use.  If they could credibly say to IBM or MIT: you will receive no US government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on use of encryption I doubt either organization would delay making use of encryption a violation of local policies.

You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard shared between the NATO governments to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons. Among other things I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card the RS232 parallel cable and the printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some intelligence to measuring emission levels I would find many other potential sources of leaked information. Where cryptography is used for serious purposes poor TEMPEST protection becomes an important security hazard. In the early eighties the need to allow some commercial concerns particularly financial institutions a level of protection against TEMPEST threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified.

As far as I can see no matter how the session keys are generated (be it Diffie-Hellman or whatever) any Cripple conversation which travels in whole or in part over a land-line is vulnerable to this scheme.  Law- enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco or illegally by finding some part of the phone line that they can cut into.  The degree of risk depends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street but not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord's ranch).  The only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (all of them) - totally impractical even if some part of the Cripple algorithm could be used as a kind of public key (I don't understand enough about these things to know). This sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone. Gosh yet another way to get round Cripple encryption.  How many is that we've found so far?

You are correct that executing PGP would be a violation (unless the patent were declared invalid by the courts) but...  there is a question as to when how or if distributing PGP would be a violation.  If the person or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so then it is clearly a sale (for example if it were on Compuserve they charge you for access so they would be selling PGP).

This is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid purpose for infringing a patent.

Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces the given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average. In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves. If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half he is likely to find a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (Here I have assumed that the DES-encryption is reversable if the key is guessed.

"2","O.K.- if you've read this group for a while you know all about the one-time-pad but here's a question I haven't seen. The one-time-pad yeilds ideal security but has a well-known flaw in authentication.  Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad and exclusive-or as the encryption operation.  If an adversary knows the plaintext of a message he can change it into any other message. Here's how it works. Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P under a key stream S Alice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P  and sends it to Bob. Eve knows the plainext P but wants the message to appear as P'. Eve intercepts C and computes  C' = C xor P xor P' = S xor P'. Eve sends C' to Bob. Bob decrypts C' by computing  C'xor S = P'  thus receiving the false message which was substituted by Eve. Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information theoretic security not just computational security. Can we define something like ideal authentication which is the analog of ideal security.  Can we obtain ideal authentication ? If not how much can we limit Eve's control over the message ? If we can achieve ideal authentication does the solution use more key bits or expand the message ?  Can we show the solution to be optimal in one or more parameters ? Does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before ? olson@umbc.edu"

"2","I can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time pad encrytped scheme though I'm not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide. An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable for Eve) block to the message and then calculate a CRC which included the random starting block and all of the message.  This could be encrypted after the message.  The problem is I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting block.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard but I'm not *that* sure....)  Clearly a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be stronger but again I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's unbreakable. A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's to include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad either.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your pad this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your opponent could spoof a valid-looking message since any deciphered plaintext in a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going on. If for each message bit M_i we used up one random bit R_i to decide whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream we'd get a total pad use of 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about half.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a guess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit she has to guess.  I'm trying to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the spoofed message but it gets a little complicated because she can get un- synched and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message. Now I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure as a one-time pad at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits. For each message bit M_i use one random bit R_i and xor them together to get X_i.  Now encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy has no way of guessing what R_i is so he/she can't guess what X_i is either. Any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess of what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits? Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random bits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly this makes spoofing messages just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it. In fact it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed message with the ciphertext as without it but I'm not entirely sure about that. Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the one-time pad? --John Kelsey"

Firstly an aside: I agree that the weakness exists but I have a lot of trouble believing that it represents a difficulty in real life. Given: 1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security and the expense of key distribution etc. imply that the clients really do want that level of security 2. These same people want to keep P a secret I find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P lying around. (I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small part of the message but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in C her known susequence starts or the result will be garbled. I find this at least as surprising.) Back to the question: If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions I would also append a Message Authentication Code to the message using up the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided and I don't know the answer. However I would propose the following for discussion. Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret random bits to share which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they CORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond. What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message. (Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't have exactly the same effect). Now at the end of the encrypted message C Alice appends a n-bit MAC computed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad): 1. compute C2 = P xor S2 and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S 2. break C2 into n-bit chunks 3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector) 4. for i in each chunk sequentially set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i] At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code. (Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the plaintext P then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in the same manner.) NLOP is the non-linear operator and there is the rub. The simplest non-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is have a fixed (even published) permutation of the n-bit integers an indexable table called Sbox and use: x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y]. Practically speaking I think this solves your problem as Eve never sees the intermediate output C2 and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid substitution on it. Also practically speaking you want the MAC to be fairly large say 32 bits but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box so you might work on 4 byte-sized S-boxes but I think that is an irrelevant detail for the discussion at hand.
