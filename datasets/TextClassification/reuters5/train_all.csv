Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the 18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.  People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPEC by drawing down more on their stock than normal  and this is having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the market which we know is not real   Lukman said. Lukman  Nigeria's oil minister  said that despite probable  minor deviations  by one or two member countries   basically OPEC is producing around what it said it would produce.  After OPEC's price and production accord last December  the market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to around 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization was producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February. But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain its discipline  in view of past experience.  We have the experience of what happened in 1986 behind us  when violations of agreements led to the collapse of the market   he said.

The first cars would be sold in West Germany  Austria and Switzerland  he said. The European base would be in West Germany  but no final decision had been made on other sites. The company will not set up its own dealer franchises  but intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation. Lutz commented   We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar.  The vehicles  on show at this week's Geneva motor show  include Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible  the Dodge Lancer ES four-door hatchback  the Dodge Shadow ES compact  the Plymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z. Chrysler is aiming for the mainstream European buyer  who appreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines  officials said.

Most of Ford's sales of the compact cars equipped with air bags have been made to fleet buyers such as the U.S. government  the paper said  with 11 000 having been sold since they were announced in late 1985. Ford executives recently said their goal is to sell annually between 500 000 and one mln cars equipped with air bags by 1990 if the federal government will relax certain regulatory standards as has been urged by some traffic safety administrative staff."

It said many of the individual assays were more than one ounce a ton but had not been cut. The company said these results were expected  because the structure was known from previous drilling as a narrow but very high-grade gold vein. Its known length is 2 800 feet and will be explored and tested as part of the underground work  Murgold said."

"1","More than two mln tonnes of surplus maizedotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic headache for the country. The grain  Southern Africa's staple  has been bought by the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it was planted  and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month in storage and interest payments to make the purchases. Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests  the surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly. Some deals have been made with aid donors  such as European countries and Australia  to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique  where the United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the hungry. But transport constraints keep those figures low and the only significant dent was a sale of 250 000 tonnes to South Africa last year. Because of the costs it has incurred  the GMB cannot afford to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been accumulating  economists here said. But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets is damaging Zimbabwe  as it needs foreign exchange to finance imports for other areas of the economy  the economists added.  At present  it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some of the extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for at the weekend will be spent here   a Western aid specialist said.  At least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the situation too badly   he added. Rainfall during the current rainy season has been far below average  ravaging all but the irrigated lands of large commercial farmers. While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year to the GMB  the government also acted late last year to slash maize production and force diversification. Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds  Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viable price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half the amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986  and above that growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs. The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops  such as sorghum  soybeans  groundnuts  tobacco and cotton  the Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February."
"1","U.S. semiconductor manufacturers struggling to stem a river of red ink  are increasingly looking toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for future profits. The market for customized chips - semiconductors designed for a very specific application or product - is expected to expand by 25 to 30 pct this year  compared with only about six pct for the entire integrated circuit industry. Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales of customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year  about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990  however  customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market  about 25 pct of total chip sales. More important for their vendors  because they are not a standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market  and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly. High volume memory chips have become  a perfect commodity market   Robert Brodersen  a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley  told an industry forum.  The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer and another and customers base their buying decisions almost entirely on price   Brodersen said. He predicted that  in the next few years  only a handful of the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese) will produce memory chips  the standard electronic component found in everything from digital watches to computers.  The rest of the industry just won't be involved.  Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference  the chip industry's annual forum for new developments  seemed to support Brodersen's prediction. Of the 116 papers presented at the conference  some 40 pct had Japanese authors  the first time they have outnumberd the United States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the memory category  including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co's attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory (dram) chip  16 times more powerful than anything now available. The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company was International Business Machine Corp's &lt;IBM> four mln bit chip  and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use  not for the open market. The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on the same  well known design standards  so they are easy to copy and inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese conglomerates as Sony Corp &lt;SNE>  NEC Corp  &lt;NIPNY> Matushita and Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics product lines  they also have a guaranteeed internal market for their chips  so they can produce huge amounts at a very low cost per unit. Customized chips  however  are designed for a specific customer  manufactured in small quantities and expensive relative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy  thus making the final product harder to clone as well. Intel Corp &lt;INTC>  the leading manufacturer of the microprocessors that form the brains of most computers  alerted the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips last fall. The company  which just reported a loss for 1986  said it will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips. Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage that the others do not. IBM  which owns a 20 pct stake in Intel  has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15 000 chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those designs and sell them to others. It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer system for designing chips  considered by experts to be one of the most advanced in the world. Intel's success is still not guaranteed  however. Industry analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market item than a customized chip that requires a close working relationship with the customer. Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time  and much lower development costs  will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed."
"1","Continental Illinois Corp settled anadministrative complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission by agreeing to recharacterize 425 mln dlrs previously reported in the second quarter 1984 as a  loss of sale on loans.  Under the settlement  which was announced simultaneously with the filing of the SEC's administrative action  Continental agreed to restate earlier financial reports to single out the 425 mln dlrs as a separate loan loss item instead of lumping it together with another item. The bank holding company said the change does not affect its operating results for 1984. The SEC stressed in the complaint that it was not challenging Continental's reported net loss for the second quarter of 1984. But it said it was misleading for the bank to split the 950 mln dlr loan loss provision in half  attributing 425 mln dlrs of it to the event of sale. The 425 mln dlrs should have been part of a 950 mln dlr billion dlr loan loss provision required by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  the SEC said. Continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs as a loss on sale of loans  the SEC said. It was misleading for the bank to list the 425 mln dlrs as loss on sale  which implied the loss would not have occurred had there not been a sale of distressed loans to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  the SEC said. The bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans  the SEC said. Continental agreed to the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying any violations  the SEC said. But it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to accommodate the SEC's objections and to report to its shareholders a summarized version of the SEC's administrative action against it  the agency said. A Continental official stressed that the settlement in no way will result in any change or restatement of the company's earnings for that period."

"1","American Motors Corp said it will takesteps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified  alternative location  after the weekend breakdown of talks with the United Automobile Workers union on a concessionary contract covering workers at AMC's Wisconsin operations. AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the company will not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at its Kenosha  Wisc.  assembly plant as a result of the talks' failure.  We sincerely regret this outcome  but the responsibility for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining committees   the company said in a statement.  We will  therefore  initiate the actions necessary to place the new Jeep product in an alternative location rather than at Kenosha.  UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regard the collapse of talks as final after the company's  final  proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union bargainers. But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessions package means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose 6 500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha  will not be getting new work  as had been proposed with a new contract.  This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining existing working and bringing new work to existing U.S. operations   AMC said. Asked if the company considered the decision to phase out the Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final  Northard said:  If the union came to us and said they would accept our final proposal  that's another matter.  But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75 had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower labor rates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated a concessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations. AMC  which last week reported its first profitable quarter in two years  said it wanted a contract for the plants with labor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between the UAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S. Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse by driving down AMC's stock price.

"1","The major U.S. Government bond brokersare likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors within the next 18 months  making their direct-dealing screens available to many of those firms that are not now eligible to receive them  said Richard Lacy  Chairman of Exco International Inc. Earlier today  Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ Holdings Corp  one of the largest of the four bond brokers that dominate the business. In a telephone interview  Lacy said  Within 18 months  we think the number of players will be expanded.  Currently  the four major brokers will sell their direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S. Government securities or those that have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer. The U.S. Justice department is looking into whether limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers is a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws. Primary dealers  of which there are now 40  are an elite group of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly from the Fed. But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the brokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as far-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens available to any firm willing to pay for one  he said  it is more likely that a  second tier  will be established. He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from the group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens widely available to any one who wants them. Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major competitors. Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any time soon. In late 1985  transaction fees paid to brokers were cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs. Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that with further increases in transaction volume  fees can be cut without hurting the brokers' profits."
"1","European Community  EC  agricultureministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at high guaranteed EC prices  diplomats said. The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations. The accord  which is due to operate from the start of the new milk marketing year on April 1  was hailed as the most significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses. Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened if the proposals are altered too radically. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into public stores when market prices and stocks are high. Faced with a butter  mountain  of a record 1.2 mln tonnes costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store  EC farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged to cut production to meet demand. He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales to other sectors such as cereals."

The retailer on April 30 will close its major Chicago distribution center as the first part of the restructuring. A spokesman said up to 1 800 workers will be affected  with many of them laid off. Some of the workers may be transferred to other Sears operations. Sears said the restructuring and consolidation will save about 150 mln dlrs by 1991. Sears said it will set up a nationwide network of seven regions to handle all aspects of distribution of its products. The closing of the Chicago plant will be followed by the shutdown of four other distribution units over the next several years. Distribution centers will be closed in Boston  Atlanta  Memphis and Minneapolis  with the Boston shutdown coming early next year. No other closings are planned before 1989. A spokesman said that  while there will be layoffs at those facilities  the company does not yet know how many workers will be let go. Sears' distribution will be consolidated under regional management in Columbus  Ohio  Dallas  Greensboro  N.C.  Jacksonville  Fla.  Kansas City  Mo.  Los Angeles and Philadelphia. However  Sears said it will also evaluate the productivity of the Los Angeles and Philadelphia facilities  to determine whether they will be modernized or relocated.

"1","Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME directors have postponed action on a membership petition calling for a ban on dual trading  CME Chairman Jack Sandner told Reuters. Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular board meeting today  but directors first wanted the opinions of a special committee that has been studying trading conditions in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six months.  We didn't want to preempt the committee   Sandner said. Instead  Sandner said the board will wait for the findings of the special S and P committee  which is considering some type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures. Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity for traders to  front-run  or trade their own accounts at more favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner said he expects the special committee to report its findings late next week and the board to act when those findings are presented. In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a ban on dual trading  Sandner pointed out that the board already unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P 500 futures at a prior meeting. The change was withheld  however  at the request of the special committee after a study was released and the committee felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively  Sandner said. Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on dual trading and  the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to a ban on dual trading.  Last week  CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500 futures and options on futures. In addition to the dual trading issue  the committee is also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P trading pit  Melamed said. Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special committee is appointed  recommendations from the committee are usually approved by the exchange board of directors."

Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17 poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt management was made to him today by Commission president Jacques Delors. Haughey said:  Delors assured me we could have full recourse to the Commission for advice  guidance and expert skills in dealing with our overall financial problems  particularily in the matter of debt management.  Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion punts a year  he added : If we could achieve any significant improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of servicing  it could have significant budgetary benefits.  He added that he would seek advice  not a Community loan. However  Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at favorable interest rates  notably for onlending to its farming sector.  It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before and we would look at it again   he said. Haughey said he regarded as  almost paramount  the maintenance of the punt's current position within the European Monetary System. He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight pct last August.  Until 1983  the policy of the Irish government was to was to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I believe that policy was right   Haughey said."
"1","Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said he does not see increasing pressure on interest rates but said the Fed would watch out for developments that could push them higher. Johnson said that it was too early to tell if recent indicators on the economy contradicted Fed expectations of continued modest growth.

However  Johnson said the Fed would be alert to an excessive depreciation in the dollar  a rise in bond yields  increases in commodity prices  or other variables.  We would have to pay attention   he said. Recent indicators on retail sales and factory orders that indicated weakness in the economy could be presenting an inaccurate picture  Johnson said. The more recent data are too caught up in statistical adjustment problems having to do with the end of the year and the beginning of the year  he said. Asked if the Fed was continuing to be generous with reserves  Johnson said   We have accommodated reasonable  non-inflationary real growth.  He said the Fed was able to do that because of the decline in inflation expectations and monetary velocity.  I don't think we can be accused of being too generous   he added."

"1","The Bank of Spain has extended thereserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds in an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which is currently fuelling money supply growth. In a statement issued late last night  the central bank said convertible peseta accounts  funds which are not subject to exchange controls  would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve requirement with effect from Friday. Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from reserve requirements. The measure comes one week after the central bank raised reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage point to 19 pct  also with effect on Friday. Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government's monetary targets. They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain's principal measure of money supply  the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP)  to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February  compared with January's 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The target for 1987 is eight pct. The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserve requirements  expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system. The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pct average for deposits. Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response  given that the market is short of funds.  But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive."

It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year  Licht said  but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha  against 2.50 mln in 1986.

On the basis of average yields this year  Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes  raw value  down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season  thanks to favourable weather  and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields  EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87  while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87."

Several trading firms had asked for a delay in the start-up of the evening session so that the firms can work out operational difficulties created by the off-hours session. CBT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said in a statement the delay will  afford all firms the time necessary to be 100 pct ready for this innovative program  we are postponing the opening date.  The board of directors accepted yesterday's recommendation by a committee of members overseeing the planned evening session  which was originally scheduled to start April 2. The session is designed to begin the global trading day from 1800 to 2100 local Chicago time Monday through Thursday. CBT members overwhelmingly approved the evening session in a vote conducted a month ago. But before night trading can begin  the CBT still has to obtain approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Pending regulatory approval  the CBT plans to offer evening trading in the world's most active futures contract  Treasury bonds  along with Treasury note futures and options on those contracts. The evening session will make available to traders in the Far East interest rate hedging vehicles when their day is just beginning  and the CBT hopes to attract trading capital from the Pacific Rim's burgeoning financial centers. When the idea for a night trading session was broached  it met with resistance from many local traders who said the session would add to the physical strain of their jobs. Many traders and member firms also questioned whether the night session would have the liquidity necessary to survive  and complained that the cost of manning trading desks for two sessions per 24-hour cycle might not be worthwhile. Some credit market analysts  including Norman Quinn  president of Golden Gate Futures  said the night session would likely be dominated by institutions  because the larger local traders would refuse to return at night. Nevertheless  Quinn and other traders said the night session has a good chance of succeeding."

"1","While most of the world's financialmarkets will be monitoring the U.K. budget  traders and analysts in the U.S. credit market will be pouring over latest housing starts data for fresh clues about current and future domestic growth trends  economists said. Most economists expect the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate to ease to about 1.75 mln units in February from just under 1.81 mln in both January and December.  The level of housing starts is likely to have declined modestly but still have remained at a relatively high level   said Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co Inc. Unfortunately  meaningful comparisons between February's and prior months' underlying trends may prove difficult.  Caution should be used when interpreting (December's and January's) increase   cautioned Smith Barney's Greenbaum.  Although underlying fundamentals remain strong -- mortgage rate stability  healthy income gains -- warmer than usual weather undoubtedly also had some influence in pushing starts higher in both months   he added. Economists at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc were more succinct in a weekly newsletter:  a slight decline across the board  no particular economic reason  mostly weather.  Charles Lieberman of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp said single-family homes would account for most of the housing starts drop although Smith Barney's Greenbaum saw signs of stabilization in both the single- and multi-family sectors.

Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market. Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today  possibly of one point  following yesterday's budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity  bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively. Partly offsetting these outflows  exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today."

"1","Mining companies may have todevelop specialty metals and metal-containing products if plastics and other substitutes are not to make further inroads in their markets  according to the United Nations. In a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on world mineral resources  U.N. experts termed conditions in the non-fuel mineral industry  unlike anything that has been experienced for the last half century.  Effects of slower global economic growth were compounded by diminishing use of the major and base metals and the development of substitutes in traditional markets  it said. The report was prepared for a nine-day session next month of the U.N. committee on natural resources  an organ of the Economic and Social Council. The gap between world productive capacity and demand would eventually be eliminated by closing mines  the report predicted.  Although for the most part mining companies have been slow to develop specialty metals and metal-containing products and to develop markets for such products  it seems that such activities will be needed if plastics and other metal substitutes are not to make further inroads into the traditional markets for the major and base metals   the experts said.  Integration of metal-producing and manufacturing enterprises between and among developed economies seems to be a likely consequence.  The report noted that  because of low prices  there was little incentive for new investment in mining except in the case of gold  which continued to attract investment at current prices with important increases in production in the past two years in North America  Australia  Papua New Guinea and Latin America."
"1","Latest Federal Reserve data suggestthat the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold  economists said.  There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month   said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  Technical and seasonal considerations aside  there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about   added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc. Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday  compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods. Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln. Finally  a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount window for the third week running  with the latest week's borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks. While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period  economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks. The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements.  Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure   said Salomon's di Clemente  noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April.  The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement   said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc  who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April. Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth  not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates. M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine  compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.  The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March   said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges. In February  M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath. Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas  some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here.  Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else   said Salomon's di Clemente  adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy's health would remain the main influence on policy but  contrary to di Clemente  he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first. Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way  adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February's U.S. trade data are due for release."
"1","Japanese short-term interest rates buoyed recently by seasonal factors  are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins  money traders said. The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23  they said. The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three  and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions. Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases  the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure  money traders said. Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates  they said. Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September. This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17 830 billion yen by the end-December  a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels  bankers said. On March 31  the money market expects to see a 2 000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds  money traders said. From April 1  they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635 pct. They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to 3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25."

"1","Economists' forecasts vary widely forthe February monthly U.S. budget deficit to be released today. However most agree on one point -- that the budget deficit for the 1987 fiscal year will narrow substantially from 1986 levels. The report is likely to mean very little to the moribund credit markets  however  which have been stilled by a stable dollar and perceptions of steady Federal Reserve policy. Economists said that a leaner federal budget could help the credit markets if it lowers the Treasury's financing needs and results in lower interest rates  but investors may not respond until they see evidence that this is taking place. Economists' forecasts for the February deficit range from 20 billion dlrs to nearly 30 billion dlrs  with most forecasts clustered in the 26-28 billion dlrs range. This compares with a deficit of 24.6 billion dlrs in February 1986. In January  the budget deficit was 2.1 billion dlrs  leaving the fiscal year-to-date deficit at 65.6 billion dlrs. Most economists expect the 1987 fiscal deficit to fall to 180-190 billion dlrs from 220.7 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986. Kathleen Stephansen of Donaldson  Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp  expects a 26.3 billion dlr February budget deficit  and a 186.5 billion dlr fiscal 1987 deficit. Stephansen expects widening in the February deficit relative to last year based on two developments. First  total revenues showed a slowdown in their yearly growth rate relative to prior months' growth rates  she said  as corporate and individual tax payments net of tax refund payments appear to have been weak in February.  The second factor... is relatively strong outlay performance   Stephansen wrote in a weekly report.  Data available to date suggest that their year-over-year growth is close to 4.3 pct  well above the 0.5 pct average that prevailed in the last four months of the fiscal year.  Joe Liro of S.G. Warburg Securities and Co expects the February budget deficit to total 26-28 billion dlrs and the fiscal 1987 deficit to be 190 billion dlrs. He said that as a result of the change in the 1987 tax code and the new structure for determining withholding of personal income tax payments  the Treasury is receiving less tax receipts than it received at this time last year.  The Administration compounded a tricky situation by saying how difficult it is to fill out the new W-4 tax forms he said.  The wage earner was underwithholding at the beginning of the year and continues to be underwithheld.  By contrast  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc said that many taxpayers have probably delayed filling out the new tax withholding forms  so that this has not been a drag on tax receipts as others have argued.  The first half of the year brought strong tax receipts from capital gains and the repeal of the investment tax credit  which is expected to contribute a substantial portion of the corporate taxes to be paid this week   he said in the firm's weekly credit market memo. He forecast a February budget deficit of 20 billion dlrs  and a fiscal 1987 deficit of 180 billion dlrs. In March  McCarthy expects to see a deficit of 23 to 24 billion dlrs compared with 30 billion dlrs in March 1986. But economists agreed that the federal budget deficit is far from occupying center stage in the credit market's focus and is unlikely to have an impact now regardless of its size. Yesterday  the key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 closed unchanged at 99-28/32 to yield 7.51 pct after trading in a narrow range throughout the session. Fed funds traded from six pct to 6-1/8 pct yesterday  up slightly from Wednesday's 5.97 pct average  and are expected to open within that range today."

"1","The entire British Petroleum Co PLCrefinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site  a refinery spokesman said. He said the rest of the 178 500 bpd refinery  including the 19 000 bpd catalytic cracker  was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days  he said. But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32 000 bpd hydrocracker  which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline  and it will be out of operation for some months. The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437 000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam  a 181 900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt  West Germany  a 181 900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant. He said the explosion and fire  in which one worker was killed  occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation. The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited  he said. This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April  but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident. Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13  but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident."

NASD did not immediately identify Woltz' former employer. The NASD said the disciplinary action was instituted by its Market Surveillance Committee for alleged violations of anti-fraud provisions under its Rules of Fair Practice. The association said Woltz consented to the sanctions without admitting or denying allegations and the suspension will start April 27 and run through May 22. It said its complaint alleges that from March 25  1985 to April 4  1985 Woltz engaged in a manipulative and deceptive practice known as marking the close of the market in a NASDAQ security. The NASD did not identify the security. The NASD said the complaint alleges that Woltz  while his firm owned a long inventory position in the security  caused the firm's quotations of the security to rise on five days within five minutes of the market close  causing the firm's bid price to be the exclusive high bid at the market close on four days and the shared high bid on the other day. It said the complaint alleges that before the market opened on each of the following business days  Woltz caused the firm's quotation to fall below its closing bid of the prior day.  At no time did the firm execute transactions at the artificially-raised prices  the NASD said. The NASD said the complain also alleges that Woltz violated Article III  Sections 1  5 and 18 of the Rules of Fair Practice."

"1","The state oil company Petroeleos deVenezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100 000 barrels a day  Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly  Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986  down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales  which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986  totalled 43.5 billion  a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said  had a very serious impact on Venezuela.  PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day  of which 658 000 bpd were crude oil and 850 000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323 000 bpd in 1985 to 342 000 bpd last year. However  Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164 000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes  shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd  of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes  Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31  1986 were 55.521 billion barrels  the fourth largest amount in the world  Hernandez said."

"1","Standard and Poor's said that currently17 finance units benefit from parent relationships by receiving higher ratings than their financial performance alone would merit. By drawing on its parent company's strength  a weaker finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its parent.  An independent finance company on the other hand must operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at a competitive disadvantage  S and P said. The agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness  as well as the support agreement it has with its parent. Standard and Poor's said that some finance subsidiaries have formal support agreements with the parent company which obligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth.  The agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time and requires it to operate within specific guidelines. Others have less formal agreements with the parent like General Electric Credit Corp &lt;GE> whose AAA rating reflects its parent's  General Electric Co.  But GE injected sizeable equity into the unit at timely intervals  S and P noted. These agreements are being tested as finance firms expand  and S and P said it will review a unit that violates the pact."

Advances led declines nine to eight in share turnover of 1.8 billion  the same as yesterday. Railway  securities house  rubber  oil  insurance  glass  fisheries  machinery and food stocks led the advance. Brokers said a meeting of the Group of Five industrial nations expected in Washington tomorrow is likely to lead to further undertakings by Japan to stimulate domestic demand. Gas  some manufacturing  shipbuilding and other shares related to the expansion of Japan's economy rose. A Nomura Securities broker said he did not expect another cut in Japan's discount rate around the time of tomorrow's talks but said the meeting would pressure Japan to import more in order to ward off a further yen rise against the dollar. Communications  real estate  warehouse  rolling stock  electric power and mining shares fell. The broad-based first section index rose 8.76 to 1 942.07 after falling 4.77 yesterday. The second section section index gained 2.77 to 2 055.38 extending yesterday's 2.58 rise in turnover of nine mln against seven mln yesterday."

"1","The dollar opened easier in quiettrading and should stay firmly entrenched in its established range ahead of this week's round of international finance meetings  dealers said.  There is little turnover  no new ideas or impulses   a dealer at a U.S. Bank said.  It promises to be a boring day.  He said the dollar's range was expected to be 1.8075 to 1.8250 marks in the run-up to the International Monetary Fund forum. The mark eased against some currencies on speculation call money rates could fall further. Despite this  the dollar opened lower at 1.8200/15 marks after yesterday's 1.8260/70. The Bundesbank is due to announce a securities repurchase tender today. Money market dealers said funds may be allocated at lower than the 3.80 pct the bank has set since its monetary package at the end of January  softening the mark's undertone. Sterling opened at 2.951/955 marks  just under yesterday's closing 2.954/958  and was seen firming further against major currencies on a wave of popularity for British prime minsiter Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservatives.  Sterling is looking very healthy at the moment   one dealer said  adding that Japanese security houses bought pounds at the start of trading. Dealers said the pound was also supported by an improved British economic outlook and stability in the oil market. The Swiss franc continued to firm against the mark as investors took advantage of the interest rate differential. It opened higher at 120.25/40 marks per 100 after yesterday's last 120.10/25. The yen strengthened to open at 1.2520/2540 marks per 100 from yesterday's last 1.2490/2510 and the French franc was unchanged at yesterday's last 30.04/07 marks per 100. The Belgian franc was stable at 4.828/830 marks per 100. The Danish crown started at 26.48/51 marks per 100  little changed from yesterday's closing 26.49/51. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from late yesterday  with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-9/16 pct. Six-month euromarks were stable at midpoint 3-7/8 pct."
"1","Asian dollar deposit rates closedsteady at opening levels in dull and featureless trading  dealers said. They said most operators refrained from taking large positions amid expectations that the group of seven would hold currency talks on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund conference in Washington later this week. Short-dates were mostly steady at the outset and remained unchanged in subsequent trading. Overnight  Wednesday/Thursday and week-fixed closed at a common 6-5/16 6-3/16 pct. Term rates were little changed from earlier levels of 6-1/2 6-3/8 pct for one month  6-9/16 6-7/16 pct for three months  6-11/16 6-9/16 pct for six months and 6-13/16 6-11/16 pct for one year. Asian dollar CD rates held unchanged at the morning's levels in quiet trading  dealers said. One month closed at 6.45/35 pct  three months at 6.55/45 pct and six months at 6.65/55 pct."
"1","Yen bond futures prices closed sharplyhigher reflecting the steep advance in cash bond prices on purchases by end-investors and banks' dealing accounts  which was followed by broker buying  dealers said. Key June ended at 110.68 against the 109.93 finish yesterday after opening at 110.25 and rising to a high of 110.75. September ended at 109.40 against 108.74. Short-term rates dropped by one point in response to a seasonal surplus of some 400 billion yen  money traders said. City and trust bank dealing acounts actively bought low coupon cash issues  accelerating the futures rally  dealers said. Most currency dealers here believe the dollar will remain bearish despite the expected Group of Seven meeting in Washington tomorrow. Should the dollar fall further  Japan might have to ease its credit policy  which would lend support to the market  bond dealers said. The unconditional yen call rate was 3.6250 pct today  up from 3.6875 yesterday. The two-month commercial bill discount rate was 3.8750 pct  up from 3.9375.

"1","The U.S. Dollar closed lower after aday of thin trading as most operators were sidelined ahead of the International Monetary Funds meeting in Washington this week  dealers said. They noted the Group of Seven industrialised nations is expected to meet and discuss currency movements during the course of the IMF gathering. But some speculative selling of the dollar was noted on conviction that the Bank of Japan will intervene less during of the meetings. The dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90. Dealers said  however  the Japanese central bank bought dollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar's falls. The U.S. Unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early 1.8230/40 and New York's 1.8260/70 close. It was under pressure also because most traders anticipated the currency meeting to bring little surprise  dealers said. Sterling advanced to 1.6200/10 dlrs from an early 1.6185/95 and New York's final 1.6175/85 on rising support to the ruling Conservative Party of Britain  dealers said. They said the pound gained ground on belief that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will call an early general election in June. But chartists said they expect strong resistance around 1.62 dlrs. Elsewhere the dollar fell to 1.5137/47 Swiss francs from New York's final 1.5180/90 and was lower at 6.0600/20 French francs against 6.0745/75. Asian dollar deposits were lower with the three months settling at 6-1/2 3/8 pct against Friday's close of 6-11/16 9/16 and the six months eased to 6-5/8 1/2 pct from 6-3/4 5/8. The Hong Kong dollar stayed on the weak side of its 7.80 peg with the U.S. Unit  finishing at 7.8015/35 against Friday's close here of 7.8005/25. Interbank rates were firmer following the local banks' move to raise prime rates by half-point to 6-1/2 pct  effective today  dealers said. The overnight rose to 4-1/2 1/4 pct from Friday's close of four 3-1/2  while the three months was unchanged at 5-1/4 1/16 pct."

"1","Rubber futures closed 0.2 to 0.9 yen perkilo down except nearby June which was unchanged at 125.2  despite a higher Singapore market this morning  dealers said. Prices maintained their decline all day after opening easier on sporadic stoploss selling due to the dollar's slight drop against the yen but nearby and mid-term months recovered slightly at the second afternoon session on small-lot buying in thin trading."
"1","Share prices closed weaker but wellabove their lows on late bargain hunting in fairly quiet trading  brokers said. The Hang Seng Index lost 15.29 points to end the day at 2 664.70 after falling more than 40 points in late morning. The Hong Kong Index shed 10.69 to 1 713.81. Turnover was 657.5 mln H.K. Dlrs against Friday's 694 mln. Brokers said sentiment remained bearish despite the late recovery as the controversy surrounding the issuance of  B  shares by major corporates still overshadowed the market  adding that the local prime rate rise also dampened interest. Brokers said the market showed little immediate impact from the suspension of trading in the shares of Wharf  World International and Hk Realty despite speculation of a reorganisation. On Friday  Wharf fell five cents to 8.60 dlrs. Cheung Kong and Hutchison ended unchanged at 41.75 and 51 dlrs on late support. Jardine Matheson shed 10 cents to 22.40 dlrs  Swire  A  50 to 21.30 and Hk Bank 10 to 8.30. Hk Hotels rose 3.50 dlrs to 74.50 dlrs in active trading.

International bullion was 421.90/422.40 dlrs an ounce aginst 418.10/60 in New York."
"1","Prices of public authority bonds werebarely changed in quiet pre-bourse trading  with some foreign investors taking profits but others opening fresh positions. Dealers said long maturities fluctuated between gains and losses of around 10 pfennigs. Today's slight drop in the value of the dollar and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Credit markets had little impact on business here. Domestic investors remained sidelined ahead of the G-7 meeting this week. Dealers said today's quietness was also a technical reaction to recent sharp gains. Mark eurobonds were little changed in thin trading. The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 10 pfennigs to 103.20  103.45. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the same address eased five pfennigs to 101.25  101.50. Yields of mortgage and municipal paper eased one to two basis points in thin trading. 10-year yields fell to 6.26 pct from 6.28 and five-year yields declined to 5.13 pct from 5.15. In mark eurobonds  the 5-1/2 pct 1992 East Asiatic offer was unchanged at 98-1/4  98-1/2. Ireland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond was steady at 98-1/2  99. Syndication managers said one new issue could be launched during the European afternoon."
"1","The cash bond market closed higher inactive trade led by securities houses' speculative buying and end-investor purchases of low coupon issues  triggered by declines in short-term interest rates  dealers said. The yield on the 5.1 pct 89th bond of 1996 closed at the low for the day of 3.905 pct against the 3.955 close yesterday  and the 3.930 opening. The 5.3 pct 95th bond of 1997 finished at 4.010 pct against 4.165 at yesterday's close and an opening today of 4.100. Active dealing accounts of city and trust banks heavily bought low coupon issues on the rate decline and in expectation of a further fall  dealers said. The lingering bearish outlook for the dollar is sustaining hopes of another drop in Japanese rates  regardless of what emerges from the expected meeting tomorrow of the G-7 meeting. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 was 95.26-28 in late Tokyo trade against the 96.04-06 New York finish. In the absence of retail participation  the key bond eased on dealer position adjustments on the dollar's renewed weakness ahead of the expected meeting. However  some bankers said Japanese investors would return to the market  due to a wider Japan/U.S. Yield gap and demand for liquidity  but only if the dollar stabilizes."

"1","Shares prices were mostly higher at theoustset  bouyed by the latest opinion polls  one of which shows the ruling Conservative party having a 13 point lead over the Labour opposition party. Record closes on both the New york and Tokyo stock exchanges supported market sentiment. Dealers expect the market to open around five to eight points higher but then ease back should buying support fail to emerge. The market appears fairly convinced of a Conservative win in the next general election but is likely to be restrained by uncertainty over its timing. Unilever rose 18p to 2 589 and British Telecom 2p to 254."
"1","The dollar started lower after an easierclose in the Far East on selling amid continuing bearish sentiment and despite Bank of Japan intervention  dealers said. But they said European markets were likely to be calm today  with the dollar remaining in a narrow trading range ahead of the Washington monetary talks. The dollar was quoted at an early 6.0565/90 francs after a late 6.0710/30 range here and close in New York at 6.0745/75. The mark was quoted at an early 332.72/75 francs per 100 against last night's late 332.70/72 range."
"1","The dollar opened easier after markets inthe Far East had sold it down for yen  defeating new attempts by the Bank of Japan to check the yen's rise through sustained currency intervention  dealers said. But trading was slow and uninsipired and although dollar sentiment remained bearish  especially against the yen  dealers expected no major movements ahead of tomorrow's Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting. Sterling remained well bid as two new opinion polls showed that the ruling Conservative party had increased its strong lead  increasing the chances of an early election  they said. The dollar opened at 145.05/15 yen compared with 146.00/10 at yesterday's European close. It closed at 145.25 yen in Tokyo after New York's 145.85/90. The dollar opened at 1.8195/8205 marks after yesterday's close in Europe of 1.8245/55. It closed at 1.8205/15 in Tokyo after finishing at 1.8260/70 in New York. Sterling opened marginally weaker on its trade-weighted index  dropping one basis point to 72.3. But it started firmer at 1.6213/23 dlrs against 1.6163/73 last night. It was also firmer against the mark. The pound opened at 2.9540/9575 marks against 2.9490/9530 in Europe last night. But it lost some ground shortly after the opening  trading quietly around 2.95 marks. Dealers said that with uncertainty still surrounding the dollar  yen and mark  sterling looks strong and attractive on due to an apparent surge of support for the ruling Conservative party  relatively high interest rates and a strong economy. One opinion poll today showed the Conservatives had a 13-point lead over the opposition Labour party and a 17-point lead over the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance. Another forecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament. One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from a Japanese institution earlier today. But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amid wariness of intervention by the Bank of England. The bank was thought to have intervened repeatedly yesterday but it was not sighted in the market today  dealers said. On the dollar  dealers said all eyes were turned to Washington where finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meet tomorrow to review their February 22 Paris currency stabilisation pact. Few expect the meeting to produce more than a vaguely worded confirmation of the Paris goals of currency stability and increased economic cooperation. This outcome would almost certainly lead to renewed dollar weakness  especially against the yen  with levels around 140 yen well within reach  some dealers said.  But you never know. Perhaps the Japanese do come up with some sort of stimulation package that would satisfy the market after all   a dealer with a U.S. Bank said. He noted news that Japan was working out a reflationary supplementary 1987 budget. A senior official of the Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party said earlier today the party has drawn up the outline of a reflationary economic package including a 5 000 billion yen supplementary budget for fiscal 1987. The dollar opened at 1.5130/40 Swiss francs against 1.5180/90 in Europe. It opened at 6.0525/75 French francs  down from its European close of 6.0660/0710."
"1","Share prices opened mixed in relativelyquiet trading after early indications suggested a positive move forward on the back of the latest opinion polls and record closing highs on the Tokyo and Wall Street stock exchanges. At 0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5. Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls  one of which  conducted for the television programme TV-AM  placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of the Opposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that the market's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that a period of consolidation is due. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today which measured party support in marginal seats gave the ruling Conservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party. Operators said although the market is generally convinced the Conservatives will win the next general election  uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide an unsettling influence. Among the leaders  ICI lost 2p at 1 333  Beecham 8p at 525 and Glaxo 4p at 1 484 but Wellcome lost 25p at 393 on profittaking  dealers said. Dealers also said fears of a trade war with Japan  although less acute  remain a nagging concern in the absence of fresh developments Unilever gained 10p to 2 560  Dixons 4p to 373  British Telecom a penny to 253 and Reuters 2p to 701. In lower oils BP shed 6p at 914 in the wake of news yesterday that Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not already own. Shell declined 5p to 1 228. Banks were mostly lower but showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503  as did Natwest at 588. Standard Chartered lost 3p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds rose one penny to 488. Government bonds showed gains ranging to 3/16 point  mostly due to bullish sentiment generated by today's opinion polls  dealers said."
"1","The dollar opened slightly lower in quiettrading  with dealers holding back ahead of the outcome of this week's top-level international monetary talks in Washington. The dollar began here at 1.5128/5138 Swiss francs  down from the previous 1.5185/5195 close and the 1.5180/5190 francs in New York. However  dealers were sceptical that anything other than a mere reaffirmation of February's Paris Accord was likely to emerge from Washington.  The dollar is likely to stay stable or drift slowly down   predicted one dealer at a major U.S. Bank. The Swiss franc was also slightly higher against the other major currencies. Sterling began at 2.4526/4557 francs  down from the previous 2.4547/4578 francs close  while the mark slipped to 83.09/19 centimes from 83.11/21 centimes.

"1","Silver  trading at around two year highs began sharply higher in relatively active trading  pulling platinum up a little in its wake  dealers said. However  gold began little changed. Silver began here at 6.74/79 dlrs an ounce  up 22 cents from the previous close here. It had briefly touched the 6.80 dlr level at the end of Far Eastern trading. The metal then fell back a little further  largely on profit-taking  but dealers said demand still remained good. However  it was not clear whether there could be a further slight downturn before the rise continued. Gold began at 421.8/422.2 dlrs an ounce  3.70 dlrs above the New York close but just 25 cents above the previous close here. Platinum began 4.50 dlrs higher at 567/571 dlrs an ounce."
"1","The Australian dollar staged a strongrecovery on the local market after sharp overnight falls offshore  as a weak U.S. Dollar and capital inflow into local gold stocks and securities boosted demand  dealers said. The dollar closed at 0.7092/97 U.S. Dlrs  after opening easier at 0.7040/45 from U.S. Lows of 0.7030/40. But the dollar still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of 0.7109/14. Traders are confident the local unit will return above 0.7100  and they regard today's fall as a correction in the currency's recent uptrend. Traders said the Australian dollar  after trading around 0.7040/50 for most of the day  surged to its day's high in late afternoon trading on Asian buying. They said offshore traders are still bullish towards the Australian dollar as yesterday's U.S. Selling occurred in thin volume. Nervousness over the short-term direction of the U.S. Dollar ahead of the International Monetary Fund meeting also provided support for the Australian dollar. In Asia  the U.S. Dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90. The U.S. Dollar also finished at 1.8208/18 marks against Tokyo's 1.8205/15 and 1.8260/70 in New York. The Reserve Bank trade weighted index eased to 55.7 points from yesterday's 56.0. The U.S. Dollar average hedge settlement rate was struck at 70.66 from 71.10."
"1","Exhausted buyers and a late fall on theAustralian share market due to profit-taking led to a sharp drop in share price index contracts on the Sydney Futures Exchange  dealers said. Domestic credit futures were mixed  with 90-day bank bills firming in line with easier physical yields as the dollar rose  they said. Ten-year bond futures  however  were steady on the day's open in line with little changed physical yields. Comex-linked gold futures were higher on rises in bullion  while international credit futures were mixed in extremely thin trade. June share price index futures closed at 1735.5 from the day's 1754.0 open  well off yesterday's record 1748.5 close. September was also well down on 1737.0 from 1763.0 after finishing at 1746.0 yesterday. About 3 154 lots were traded. Dealers said the momentum of the futures market appeared to be exhausted  with a return to bigger discounts now likely. Demand for gold and industrial stock continued to drive up the all ordinaries index  which climbed 8.5 points to 1754.8  although this was well off the day's highs after late profit-taking. Easier physical yields  as a result of the firmer Australian dollar  also saw rises in 90-day bank bill futures. June contracts rose to 85.16 from the day's 85.00 open in active trade after falling to a low of 84.96. September rose to 85.25 from 85.12 after finishing yesterday at 85.20. About 6 912 contracts were traded. Physical yields eased to 15.48/53 pct from 15.60. June 10-year bond futures  the only month to trade  were steady on the day's 86.87 open after closing yesterday at 86.96. About 7 041 lots were exchanged. Physical March 1997 paper was 13.11/14 pct from 13.14. June Comex-linked gold futures finished strongly at 425.00 U.S. Dlrs an ounce from the day's 423.20 open and overnight close of 422.60 in line with strong gains in bullion. Only nine lots were traded. International credit futures were mixed  with June U.S. T-bonds finishing lower at 97.27 from the day's 97.30 start  well off the overnight Chicago close of 98.04. The contract was untraded locally yesterday. June Eurodollars were untraded on a buy/sell quote of 93.31/36 after finishing at 93.35 in Chicago from a local close yesterday of 93.36."

"1","Secondary sectors of the eurobond market where changed  were generally firmer in quiet morning trading with attention again tending to focus on currencies other than the dollar  dealers said. The sterling straight market opened with further gains of 1/8 or 1/4 point with sentiment boosted by the publication of two more opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party with a substantial lead over opposition parties. Dealers said operators seem a little more cautious this morning since profit-taking is expected to emerge soon after recent substantial gains. The dollar straight sector was little changed with yesterday's gains on the U.S. Bond market being balanced out by a slightly easier dollar. The market is now awaiting news which may emerge from tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in Washington.  It's not often you can call the dollar straight sector a backwater in the market but that's what it is at the moment   a head trader at a U.S. Firm said. U.S. Treasury security trading was also quiet with retail participation limited to enquiry  dealers said. The 30-year long bond was quoted at 95-30/32 pct at 0845 GMT. The yen and Australian dollar sectors remained buoyant although volume was lower than yesterday morning  dealers said. Yen bonds were 1/4 to 3/8 point firmer with initial buying coming from the Far East  dealers said. The market was boosted by a very firm Japanese bond market in which the yield on the key 5.1 pct bond due 1996 dropped to close at 3.905 pct compared with yesterday's close of 3.955 pct. In the Australian dollar market there was some retail demand for zero coupon bonds  dealers said."
"1","Raw sugar futures continued theirovernight decline in early trading by posting losses from yesterday's final call of 0.40 to 1.20 dlrs  dealers said. Volume at the end of a 10 minute opening call was 85 lots. The modest fall was attributed to lack of follow-through to yesterday's mid-session rise with New York's similar downturn yesterday seen as an additional unsettling influence  they said. There is no fresh physicals news although India and Syria are in the market tomorrow for whites  to coincide with the weekly white sugar tender by the European Community (EC).

"1","Cocoa futures were about unchanged fromlast night by midmorning with near July trading at 1 319 stg from 1 318 asked and a 1 324/1 318 high-low. Sterling's strength together with continued availability of West African new crop physical offerings more than outweighed any bullish impact from last night's higher New York market. Dealers said the market had been forecast to open as much as 10 stg up  basis New York's close. The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1 325 French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was there at around 1 460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar  they said. Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in the near future  the only other bullish feature is the lower trade forecast for Bahia's temporao crop which was recently reduced to 1.5/2.0 mln bags from 2.0/2.5 previously and compared with initial expectations of up to three mln bags. Dealers said trade ideas are now pointing to the lower end of the new forecast range although in terms of world production this may well be evened out by a better than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop. Terminal volume after 75 minutes was 248 lots including 76 lots crossed."
"1","U.S. Shares traded in London were firmerin the wake of Wall Street's gains into record territory yesterday  but gains were patchy with interest centered mainly on the special situation stocks  dealers said.

"1","Raw sugar futures fell to session lows bymidmorning  suffering losses from last night of between 2.20 and 1.80 dlrs a tonne in a 341 lot volume  dealers said.

"1","Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct  from around 3.55 pct earlier today after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a new securities repurchase pact  dealers said. The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct  unchanged from the rate on recent facilities. Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down in line with market rates for call money. When this did not happen  because of more than adequate liquidity  many participants decided to withdraw funds from the market and use them to build up minimum reserves further. This resulted in the slight rise in call money. Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5  averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month  well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserve requirement  dealers said. There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank was offering more funds above the call money rate. But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facility was in line with one month money  which traded at 3.80/85 today after 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1. Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely to bid  and the Bundesbank allocate  less than the 14.9 billion marks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pact expires. One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated. Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwilling to cut rates on this pact  as it is the first under its faster and more flexible tender process and because a lower rate might have been associated with the new system. Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would over the next month lower the call money range from the narrow 3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently."

"1","Long debt futures turned easier in latemorning on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) as the dollar and sterling softened  dealers said. Long gilt futures had a good start with an opening range of 124-10/32 to 124-14/32 from 124-7/32 overnight as sentiment was boosted by two opinion polls showing a comfortable lead for the ruling Conservatives. They made a high of 124-19/32 but met chart resistance. A wave of professional sales hit the market at 1000 GMT  driving the price to a low of 124 after minor support at 124-6/32 was breached. This coincided with a dip in sterling to 72.2 on its trade- weighted index against 72.3 at the start and 72.4 last night. At the same time  the dollar was dipping below 145 yen after a night of pressure in the Far East. June T-bond futures made lows of 97-18/32 and settled around 97-21/32 at 1015 GMT after opening 8/32 easier at 97-26/32. Analysts said the markets remained cautious because of a series of talks in Washington this week between finance ministers of industrial countries. June Eurodollars started at 93.33  a technical support point  and eased to 93.30 or 0.06 below last night. Analysts said sterling contracts would have difficulty advancing beyond current levels if the market discounts the Conservative victory predicted by the opinion polls. Other difficulties were sterling's inability to breach the 2.96 mark ceiling  which could indicate the Bank of England is trying hard to keep a lid on the U.K. Currency. Also  market talk of a further base rate cut has died down  although another cut was virtually discounted by mid-March. June short sterling futures were little changed in early trading from last night's 90.78 but slipped to a low of 90.73 by late morning. Interbank interest rates were unchanged. June FT-SE 100 futures saw an opening range of 204 to 203.70 in line with last night's 203.80 but made a low of 202.20 late morning. The underlying index opened only slightly weaker and losses extended to 11 points by 1030 GMT. Long gilt options featured 465 June calls at 125  127 at 130 with 118 June puts at 122 and 195 at 126."

"1","The dollar was steady near lower openinglevels in extremely quiet trading and dealers did not expect the U.S. Currency to move significantly before the series of high-level monetary meetings starting today in Washington. Sterling trading was equally quiet. Bullishness on the back of two new opinion polls suggesting Britain's ruling Conservative party had increased its lead over the opposition was checked by fears of fresh sterling-selling intervention by the Bank of England  dealers said. The dollar fetched 1.8215/25 marks at midsession against 1.8195/8205 at the opening and 1.8245/55 in Europe last night. The dollar was quoted at 145.10/20 yen  virtually unchanged from its opening 145.05/15 but sharply below yesterday's European closing 146.00/10. It briefly dipped below 145 yen  to a quoted low of 144.85  but recovered later to trade quietly around opening levels  dealers said. Trade-weighted  sterling stood at 72.3 pct of its 1975 value  unchanged form the opening but one basis point below yesterday's close. The pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and 1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and 1.6213/23  and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73. Dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in Europe after a large selloff against the yen in the Far East  which sustained Bank of Japan intervention failed to stem earlier today. They said that in the absence of other factors  participants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of Group of Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington today  and Group of Seven monetary talks tomorrow. Most dealers expected the meetings to produce little more than a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectives of stable currency markets and economic policy coordination. The Group of Five and Canada agreed in Paris on February 22 to call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline  and several participant central banks have since intervened to keep currencies within narrow ranges against each other. But a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions between the U.S. And Japan last month encouraged markets to test the agreement  pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen. Dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking by Japan at the Washington talks to step up efforts to reduce trade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand  the dollar would resume its fall  especially against the yen. Without agreement on the trade issue  the dollar appears set to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term  with 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks  dealers said. Some dealers said Japan appears ready to compromise with the U.S. On economic policy issues. Expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in the Japanese discount rate and Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party today announced an outline agreement on economic reflation which includes a 5 000 billion yen additional budget for 1987  the dealers said. Some dealers said the market could get some impetus from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker when he testifies on Third World debt problems before the Senate banking committee later today. Dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidence the ruling Conservative party is assured of victory in an election which they said would likely be called for June. One poll out today showed the Conservatives leading with 43 pct support against Labour's 30 pct and the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance at 26 pct. Another poll forecast a Conserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament. But wariness of Bank of England sterling-selling intervention made participants cautious about pushing the pound much higher  dealers said. Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to have intervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they had not detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sighted Bank intervention today. The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs at midsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90 European close. It fetched 6.0575/0625 French francs against 6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close."
"1","Prices of public authority bonds endeda quiet bourse session lower  with domestic investors taking profits in a technical reaction to recent strong gains. Dealers said long maturities dropped as much as 50 pfennigs but most paper lost around 20 pfennigs. Foreigners  which had been buying and selling West German public authority bonds in pre-bourse business  remained sidelined during bourse trading. Today's slight dollar drop and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Credit markets had little impact. Dealers said this week's G-7 meeting in Washington made investors wary and led to the squaring of some positions. Most dealers said underlying sentiment for bonds remained favourable and there were some speculations global interest rates could fall further in the not too distant future. The Bundesbank bought 109.9 mln marks worth of public authority paper here after selling 80.7 mln yesterday. The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 40 pfennigs to 102.90  103.15. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the same address also shed 40 pfennigs to 100.90  101.15. In contrast to the public authority bond sector  prices of mortgage and municipal paper firmed in active business  dealers said. 10-year yields fell two basis points to 6.26 pct. Market indicator prices for International Rubber Agreement. All pence per kilo any origin cif Europe for May shipment. No.1 RSS 62.50 No.3 RSS 57.00 TSR 20   53.00 Mark eurobond prices eased 1/8 point in thin trading  with domestic and foreign investors remaining largely sidelined. The 5-1/2 pct 1992 East Asiatic bond was quoted unchanged against yesterday at 98-1/4  98-1/2. Ireland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond was steady at less 1-3/4  less 1-1/2. Syndication managers said one new issue could be launched during the European afternoon. But primary activity was expected to remain subdued in April. Only two or three further issues were expected during the first half of the month. The second half is shortened by the long Easter holiday weekend."
"1","Equities steadied near the day's lows atmidsession after a hesistant start mainly due to lack of interest in quiet trading conditions. Dealers said most of the trading appeared to be inter-professional  highlighting the market's cautious approach in the wake of yesterday's strong performance. The latest opinion polls strengthened the market's conviction that the Conservatives will win the next general election  but the uncertainty over the date continues to provide an unsettling factor. At 1141 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 10.6 down at 1.979.0. In a poll conducted for television programme TV-AM showed the Conservative Party 13 points ahead of the Oppsition Labour Party. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today  which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats  gave the Conservative party a lead of six points over Labour. Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan  although less pronounced  provides a further note of caution  dealers said. Yesterday the Japanese finance ministry said it will help expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate foreign membership. The lack of enthusiasm for shares this morning despite gains to record territory on both the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges further underlined market nervousness. ICI fell a penny at 1 334  Glaxo 8p at 1 480  Beecham 12p at 521  BPB 10p to 660 and P and O 3p to 617. Wellcome shed 23p to 397 on profittaking after adverse press comment on the side effects of its  Retrovir  aids drug  dealers said. London International  makers of condoms  gained 14p at 302 in contrast. Among few other gains Jaguar rose 12p to 587 mainly on U.S demand  dealers said  Unilever added 8p at 2 578  Plessey 2p to 243  as did Reuter at 701p. In lower oils BP shed 13p at 907p after news yesterday Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not already own. Shell lost 10p at 1 223. Banks mostly showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503 as did Natwest at 588. Standard Chartered lost 4p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds was one penny higher at 488. Extel further declined today  losing 28p to 462 in the wake of news yesterday British Printing and Communications Corp and its associates said they would not be making a bid for the company. In mixed insurances Sun Life gained 7p at 1 085  Prudential Corp rose a penny  at 833 while Royal declined 4p to 945 as did Sun Alliance at 828. The market now awaits Wall Street's opening  which is expected mixed to higher  for further direction.

"1","After a few days of volatility  thecredit markets show signs of settling back into the frustratingly narrow ranges that prevailed for much of the first quarter  economists said. Friday's weak employment data for March braked an ascent in bond yields before the 30-year yield could reach the psychologically important eight pct level. But  with question marks hanging over the strength of the economy and  more critically  the value of the dollar  economists said the market remains fragile and will not quickly recoup the ground lost in the past two weeks. The 30-year bond yield closed Monday at 7.84 pct  down from 7.86 pct on Friday and a 12-month high last week of 7.93 pct  but trading was lackluster.  People are sitting on the fence  they don't really know what to do   said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.  Our retail accounts are not committing themselves either way.  No economic indicators are due today  but the markets will hear Congressional testimony from Fed chairman Paul Volcker at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT) and will be alert for the possibility of another outright purchase of securities by the Fed. The Fed needs to buy a large volume of securities at this time of year to offset the reserve drain caused by a build-up of Treasury funds at the Fed around the April 15 tax date. The Fed confounded most economists' predictions of a bill  pass  last week by buying instead a record 2.2 billion dlrs of notes and bonds  and Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the Fed could make it two in a row by offering to buy coupon securities today or Wednesday. The Fed will not buy bills since they are already in relatively short supply after heavy Treasury paydowns in recent weeks  she argued.  They haven't paid down so many bills before in a quarter   Ramirez said  noting that the Treasury has been able to reduce the size of its regular bill auctions because of strong tax revenues following the reform of the tax code at the beginning of the year. Because it would be unprecedented for the Fed to conduct back-to-back coupon  passes   most economists still expect the Fed to buy bills this week instead of bonds and notes. After trading late yesterday at 6-1/8 pct  Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open at 6-1/8  6-1/4 pct."

"1","Stock prices may climb higher today riding a two-day advance that saw the Dow Industrials climb 85 points  analysts said. But they cautioned that the market is due for a pause after such a strong climb and could move into a short term consolidation today as well. Yesterday  the Dow Jones Industrial average closed above the 2400 mark for the first time ever. Special situations  airlines and a strong bond market helped push the average up 15 points to end the day at 2406. Gainers led losers by seven-six on the Big Board  while volume slid slightly to 175 mln shares from 213 mln shares last Friday.  I think we'll get a day that will be  on balance  positive  but not any record setter   Thom Brown of Butcher and Singer said. Brown said that the market needs a pause before any stronger advance.  We need a bit of consolidation here   he said.  Eighty-five points is just too much  too soon.  Brown added that the market probably will not pay much attention to the February consumer credit number being released today.  The market's been ignoring fundamentals   he said.  I don't see any problems with the Blue Chips easing higher today   Chris Callies of Dean Witter said. But she said the market may have some short term trouble in this 2400 area.  We're still in the midst of a correction  in the broad market  she said.  It's not entirely clear that this rally is the end of the two day correction that began last week.  In the newspapers -- The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street said some people feel that when Mesa Limited Partnership provided badly needed assets to NRM Energy in exchange for a large stake in the company the move may have turned NRM into a T. Boone Pickens investment fund. The New York Times Market Place column said the first half hour of trading is becoming more important. That is the time when a large amount of important and growing investment from Japan and Europe enters the market. Indeed  the column said that a Salomon Brothers study shows that 44 pct of the market's total gain during the first two and a half months of this year came in the first half hour of trading."

The nearby covering was prompted by supply tightness created by likely large April option declarations but no reports circulated this morning of any further enquiry for short term April options.

"1","The dollar opened lower following thetrend set earlier in the Far East and Europe  dealers said. Still  the U.S. currency remained well within recent trading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out on a limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington. The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism that this week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measures to stabilise currencies. But whatever their opinions  U.S. dealers remained cautious of selling the dollar aggressively. The dollar opened at 145.10/20 yen  down from 145.85/90. The dollar's decline occurred despite renewed Bank of Japan intervention on its behalf in Tokyo  dealers noted. Dealers in Japan said the central bank bought dollars steadily for yen during Tokyo hours.  There were some large sell-orders in Tokyo  but apparently it wasn't too hectic   said a dealer at one major U.S. bank.  The tone still is very cautious ahead of the Washington meetings.  The dollar also opened at 1.8220/30 marks  down from 1.8260/70 at last night's close  and at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs  down from 1.5180/90. Meanwhile  sterling prolonged its advance with the aid of more public opinion polls indicating the ruling Conservative party would retain power with a large majority in any general election. Sterling rose to 1.6186/91 dlrs  from 1.6175/85 on Monday  but eased slightly to about 2.953 marks from 2.955. Dealers did not detect any U.K. intervention to subdue the pound today. Some said the U.K. central bank may have bought dollars for yen in Europe  but this could not be confirmed. The dollar eased to 1.3071/76 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday  showing limited response to president Reagan's endorsement of efforts for U.S./Canada free trade."

Iraq said today it attacked Iran's Sirri Island as well as offshore oil escalations west of Kharg Island. Iran meanwhile reported victories on the southern front in its war with Iraq. These reports may support the market  which is  begging for news   said one broker. He said resistance is at 18.75-18.85 dlrs  then 19.00 dlrs a barrel for May crude. Products are called 0.25-0.50 cent higher a gallon following gasoil futures which ended the morning session 1.25 dlrs higher a tonne basis April  which expired today  and 1.00 dlr higher basis May  traders said."

"1","Comex gold futures opened firmer on theback of a weak dollar and firm silver values. The pacesetting June delivery was up 90 cts at 423.50 dlrs an ounce  recouping some of yesterday's light losses of 1.50 dlrs. Other contracts gained 1.70 to 2.30 dlrs. Floor analysts said the precious metal mirrored the action in the silver trading ring more than anything else. Speculators continued to buy silver on hopes it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce in the May contract. The stock market again acted as a drag on gold even though it slipped on profit-taking this morning  analysts said."

"1","U.S. credit markets opened lower undercut by a weaker dollar  dealers said. The impetus for the opening declines came from overseas trading  where a lack of retail buying led to profit-taking that erased yesterday's moderate gains  dealers said. Most investors have stepped to the sidelines to await the outcome of this week's monetary meetings in Washington and to see how it affects exchange rates  they added. The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond opened 17/32 lower at 95-22/32 to yield 7.88 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close. It fell to 95-26/32 in late Tokyo trade.  How the bond market trades seems to be a mirror image of how the dollar/yen trades   a dealer said.  As the dollar goes  so goes the market  but so far we're just bouncing around in thin trading.  Skepticism that this week's monetary meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington will produce substantive agreements to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan and take pressure off the dollar is weighing on bond prices.  I can't imagine that anything of much substance could comoe out of these meetings other than a reiteration of previous statements   a dealer said. Dealers said U.S. government securities prices will be vulnerable as long as further dollar declines are expected. The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/16 to 99-20/32 at the opening and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 11/32 to 97-25/32. Treasury bill rates rose in early trading  pulled higher in sympathy with the rise in coupon yields. Three-month bills were unchanged from yesterday's auction price at 5.53 pct bid  while six-month bills rose six basis points from their auction price to 5.69 pct bid. Year bills rose four basis points to 5.77 pct bid. The Federal funds rate opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained at this level in early trading. It averaged 6.20 pct yesterday. Economists said seasonal pressures on bank reserves point to a possible indirect injection of temporary reserves by the Federal Reserve this morning. Some look for the Fed to purchase coupon securities this afternoon. Dealers said the market may take its next cue from Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's Congressional testimony at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT) this morning."
"1","Live cattle futures were expected tocontinue their upward climb to new season's highs and highest levels in years as fundamentals continue to point upward  traders said. They cited steady to higher live calls as the main buying factor. Market-ready supplies remain tight and packer interest has been improving  they noted. A firm tone to cash wholesale beef and moderate boxed beef movement at higher cutout prices were also cited as supporting factors. Stopping of deliveries by strong hands will likely add to strength in spot April  they added."
"1","Platinum futures rose in thin earlytrading as the metal again followed silver to higher ground  floor analysts said. The key July delivery traded at 573.50 dlrs an ounce  up 4.90 dlrs. Other months posted gains of 4.40 to 7.40 dlrs. Palladium was 20 to 70 cts firmer in sympathy. Silver continued to set the pace for the metals complex  attracting purchases by professional traders and investors amid speculation the metal would soon breach selling resistance at seven dlrs an ounce in the May delivery. However  quick day-trader profit taking in the silver ring spilled over and platinum also backed off from early highs  brokers said."
"1","Live Hog futures were expected to opensteady to mostly higher after yesterday's mostly higher close. Traders anticipate carryover demand prompted by firmer live calls and the continued discount of futures to cash. Hog runs are light as farmers are starting spring fieldwork in some areas  they noted.

Spillover strength from higher cattle pits is also likely again today  they added."

Cargill  the Illinois Co-op  Refco and ADM were the featured buyers of old crop May  with CIS a buyer in new crop December  pit brokers said."
"1","Equities drifted lower after the easieropening on Wall Street  but the London market was depressed from the outset on lack of interest and a feeling that yesterday's gains were overdone  dealers said. Much of today's business was inter-professional  but dealers noted that despite today's falls and low volume the market still had a firm  although cautious  undertone. At 1430 GMT the FTSE 100 index was down 8.1 points at 1 981.5 compared with an opening 1 987.4. Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan  although less pronounced  provided further caution. Yesterday  the Japanese finance ministry made moves to try and dispel fears of a trade war by saying it will help to expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate foreign membership. However  British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard has told Japan to resolve the row over Cable and Wireless' shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations. Cable and Wireless  which has been at the centre of the trade row  was up 2p at 372. The latest media opinion polls helped to underpin prices as they strengthened the belief that the ruling Tory party will win the next U.K. General election. Although there is still uncertainty over the timing of the election  most dealers polled by Reuters this afternoon thought that June would be the most likely time. A poll conducted for the breakfast television programme TV-AM showed the Conservatives 13 points ahead of the Opposition Labour Party  while a poll in the Times newspaper  which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats  gave the Tories a lead of six points over the labour opposition. Market leader ICI stood unchanged at 1 335 but IC Gas slipped 14p to 752 on profit-taking after yesterday's stong gain while Jaguar rose 15p to 590 mainly on U.S demand ahead of a motor show in New York. Pharmaceuticals had Wellcome down 23p to 397 on further profit-taking in the wake of adverse press comment on the side effects of its  Retrovir  aids drug. London International Group gained 13p to 301 as operators switched out of Wellcome. Extel lost a net 26p to 464 in the wake of yesterday's news that Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp would not be making a bid for the company. In a generally easier oil sector  BP fell 18p to 912 after yesterday's statement by Standard Oil that it considered BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of the company it does not already own as  inadequate.  In banks  Standard Chartered lost 4p to 820 after its recent gains on the back of bid rumours  but dealers noted press speculation that Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court had increased his stake in the company yesterday. Many operators expect Lloyds bank to renew its offer for Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July  although some dealers thought this unlikely. Lloyds gained 1p to 488. Elsewhere  industrial group Norcros gained 9p to 448 on speculation of a bid for the company  while food retailer Tesco added 2p to 475 after extending its 151 mln stg contested bid for Hillards Plc until May 1. Hillards was a penny up at 314. Government bonds stood generally lower in late trading with prices drifting down on a lack of interest. Gilts gained around 5/16 point at the outset on the back of the opinion polls. Equities tended to move up in later quiet trading as Wall Street rallied from its early lows. At 1556 GMT the FTSE 100 was down just 4.7 points at 1 984.9 after a low of 1 977.2 at 1354 GMT. Dealers said most in the market appear to expect share prices to move higher tomorrow  but volume will remain relatively light ahead of an announcement of the election date. They said given the thin trading conditions the market's movements will be volatile in the coming few sessions."
"1","Money market interest rates closed littlechanged after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K. Base lending rates fizzled out  dealers said. Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party well ahead had little effect on the market with operators looking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling continued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in Washington this week. One senior money broker commented   What we want is an election date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the market knows what's happening then we can move forward.  The next move in U.K. Base rates  which now stand at 10 pct  is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date of a general election is making for cautious trading  dealers said. Yesterday  opinion polls showing the Government was set to retain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and fuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates. The British authorities are likely to remain cautious  however  as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review their February Paris accord on currency stability. This could affect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in trade weighted terms to stand at 72.3. Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the day-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of England. As rates fell yesterday  no band four bills  which have a maturity of between two and three months were transacted. Today  however  these again appeared but the majority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to two months range. The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged quoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until fresh economic or political news emerges  dealers say they expect the market to continue around these levels with only technical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates. The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the system today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite this  overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range having started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct. Period interbank rates were little changed with six months quoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct. Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine months ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct respectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from late yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three months at 9-17/32 15/32 pct."

Other minings were firm but platinums eased. Industrials also closed mixed to firmer  the index once again hitting a new high of 1757 from Friday's 1753 finish.

"1","Gold and silver closed off the day'shighs on profit-taking  but silver  which continued to set the pace  remained well up on yesterday's close  dealers said.

Yesterday's close was 6.52/54 dlrs. Some investors were noted selling gold and switching into silver.

Dealers said it was unclear if the silver rally had peaked or if fresh gains could be achieved in New York.  A lot depends on the Dow Jones index   one dealer commented.

Steady speculative buying after yesterday's strong close kept the chart picture very bullish and supported initial values  traders said. Rumors that exporters are planning to ship SRW wheat out of Toledo and/or Chicago  further tightening already low deliverable stocks  kept May firm relative to new crop months  they added. However  the rally failed to follow-through due to the lack of confirmed export sales of significant quantities of U.S. wheat so far this week  as some traders expected."
"1","The dollar closed virtually unchangedfrom yesterday's finish  but near the day's high after another extremely quiet session. With the G-5 meeting in Washington ahead of this week's IMF interim committee  traders remained reluctant to open any large positions. Towards the end of the day the dollar firmed after failing earlier to hold beneath 1.82 marks. Some dealers said Senate testimony from Fed Chairman Paul Volcker also lent support. The dollar closed at 1.8265/75 marks after opening at 1.8200/15 and closing yesterday at 1.8260/70. Volcker said that a further sizeable dollar decline could be counter-productive  and that exchange rate adjustments have been enough to narrow the U.S. Trade deficit. Such remarks in the past might have moved the dollar sharply  today they only pushed it up 20 or 30 basis points when it was already firming for technical reasons. The dollar in any case held in a narrow range today  trading early in the morning just below 1.82 marks and rising to a high of 1.8270. Dealers said they were awaiting comments after the G-5 meeting from U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. Looking slightly further ahead  the market is awaiting U.S. February trade data  due on April 14. Another set of disappointing figures could push the dollar below its recent 1.80-85 mark range if there have been no supportive statements from G-5 officials in Washington in the meantime  dealers said. Sterling closed slightly easier at 2.950/954 marks  after opening at 2.951/955 and closing yesterday at 2.954/958. The pound has been buoyed by expectations the ruling Conservatives will win the next U.K. Election. But dealers said sterling now looks high against the mark and room for further gains must be limited. Many dealers believe sterling will enter the EMS joint float after a U.K. Election. In this case  its ceiling could well be at or near 2.95 marks  dealers said. The yen closed at 1.2550/70 marks per 100 after closing yesterday at 1.2490/2510  and the Swiss franc firmed to 120.55/70 marks per 100 from 120.10/50. The French franc ended unchanged at 30.04/07 marks per 100."
"1","Live Hog futures ran up for gains of0.57 to 0.07 cent in eary trade paced by April and June. Fairly active demand reflected strength in cash hogs and the continued discount of futures to cash.

However  prices slipped from the highs in latest trade as commercial profit-taking developed. Some selling was also attributed to expectations that cash ham prices will be falling soon on a seasonal basis  they said. Thomson and RBH bought while Packers Trading and Refco sold.

"1","CBT corn futures held gains of two to2-3/4 cents per bushel in moderately light midsession trade. Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure to about three times last year's weekly inspections  plus the outlook for a continued active export pace due to the decline in the U.S. dollar this year  supported nearbys  traders said. Diminished PIK-and-roll activity  compared with the active pace seen last week  added to the more positive tone. Most dealers expect the contract lows in corn futures to hold  with some looking for the improving chart picture to support a further advance. A local house  Cargill  the Illinois Co-op  Refco and ADM were the featured buyers of old crop May  with Drexel/Burnham a steady buyer in new crop December  pit brokers said."

"1","Raw sugar futures rallied from sessionlows by late afternoon on jobber shortcovering and trade buying  posting pared losses from last night of 1.20 to 0.60 dlrs. The rally mirrored a similar upturn in New York after the market had reacted bearishly to the realisation that new raws offtake from China and the Soviet Union was not materialising. However  dealers said  sentiment was still buoyed by prospective whites buying by India  Syria and Pakistan. Tomorrow's European Community (EC) tender result was difficult to predict after last week's authorisation of 102 350 tonnes at the highest-ever subsidy of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos. Tomorrow's EC tender was made all the more difficult to project by the movement last week of nearly 800 000 tonnes sugar to intervention by operators protesting about low rebates  dealers said. Near Aug was finally quoted at 154.60/154.80 dlrs (bid-asked) from 155.80/156 last night and a session high-low of 155.80/152.

The breakdown of the spread premium equated to 20  seven and five stg for the first  second and third months  respectively. Standard metal finished with an indicated backwardation of around two stg. Morning ring dealings ended with forward business at a high of 883 stg per tonne  equivalent to 1 417 dlrs. Business featured a wave of cash pricing purchases near the official close which established an indicated spread backwardation of 37 stg after earlier borrowing at a premium of 32  unchanged from yesterday afternoon  traders said. Forward values extended pre-market gains  despite currency factors  with short covering and some chart support evident. Ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing interest from end April dates for one month at a backwardation of 23 stg. Analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a minor chart support base  although upside potential remains limited against a background of only routine physical demand and a buoyant U.K. Currency.

The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish  which could limit declines when South American sales begin to pick-up later this month  they added. However  some traders said new crop prices above 5.00 dlrs a bushel could encourage some farmers to plant more soybean acres than they originally planned."

"1","The dollar remained on the defensive insubdued dealings with few traders willing to take any major risks ahead of this week's international monetary meetings in Washington  dealers said.  Everybody is waiting for developments from the talks. In the meantime  it's just jobbing positions back and forth   said a dealer at one U.S. bank. The Group of Five  comprising the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  France and the U.K.  are scheduled to convene today. The dollar hovered at 145.25/30 yen  down from 145.85/90 last night  and eased to 1.8255/60 marks from 1.8260/70. The stage for the dollar's decline was set overnight in the Far East where the U.S. currency retreated despite steady intervention on its behalf by the Bank of Japan. Dealers in Japan cited speculation that the G-5/G-7 talks are unlikely to produce any significant or lasting measures to stabilize currencies as one reason for the sell-off. No central bank intervention was detected in the U.S. where the dollar kept well within recent trading parameters. Despite the view that trade and economic imbalances dictate a downward course for the dollar  few U.S. dealers wished to sell it aggressively before this week's meetings. Statements by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker during testimony before the Senate Banking Committe failed to rouse the market from its inertia. Volcker reiterated that a further  sizeable dollar decline may be counter-productive. He also said that currency changes that have occurred so far should be large enough -- in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S. -- to support expectations for a narrower U.S. trade gap.  There was nothing new or remarkable there   said a dealer at one European bank. The dollar's brief rise to 1.8270 marks was already underway when Volcker spoke  he added. With the dollar becalmed  dealers looked to cross-rates  especially sterling  yen and Swiss franc  for interest. Sterling continued to benefit from U.K. public opinion polls indicating a lead for the ruling Conservative party in any general election and following signals of an improved economy. The pound hovered at 1.6175/85 dlrs  unchanged from Monday  and at 2.955 marks  off slightly from about 2.955 last night. The dollar eased to 1.5120/30 Swiss francs from 1.5180/90  and to 1.3048/53 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday."
"1","Cocoa futures ended a moderate day'strade narrowly mixed from last night at one stg down to two up in a 2 227 lot volume including 523 crossed and 278 switches. Dealers said contrasting bearish and bullish factors kept the market in narrow range trading  leaving July quoted at 1 319 stg from 1 318 asked yesterday and a high-low of 1 324/1 316. Prices were pressured early by firm sterling against the dollar as well as overhead West African new crop offers. Opposing support was seen from prospective ICCO buffer stock buying (possibly next week) and recent Bahia Temperao crop forecasts at down to 1.5 mln bags  dealers said. The Ivory Coast was believed to have sold new crop yesterday around 1 325 French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was also reported to be offering new crop at 1 460 stg a tonne cif. Such offers were still available although the fall from earlier highs would have made them out of reach  dealers said. Resale physicals were basically quiet although some book-squaring was likely to have taken place in the run-up to buffer stock buying  they said."

"1","Wall Street demonstrated itsperseverance today as it recovered from an early wave of selling and posted a strong advance at midday.

The Dow Industrials  down 10 in the first minutes of the session when a weak dollar and falling bond prices underscored the market's lingering interest rate anxieties  recovered to stand at 2417  up 11 points at midday. The broader market showed less vigor  however  as advances eked out a lead over declines. Volume was a strong 106 mln shares. Ford  up over a point for most of the session  stood at 90-5/8  up 1/2. Traders said that speculation that the company will announce a stock split and dividend increase at its board meeting on Thursday  encouraged the buying. Ford rose 2-5/8 yesterday. General Motors rose 1-5/8 to 83-1/8 in anticipation of bullish news coming out of an analysts meeting scheduled for Thursday and Friday  traders said. Chrysler  not expected to make any major announcements this week  fell 1/2 to 57-3/4.  With the bonds weak this morning  the blue chips have been holding the market up and that advance was sustained by an influx of foreign money   analyst Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said.  But poor breadth and poor performance by the transport and utility averages and the fact the market is at the top of its trading band supported in large part by foreign cash  makes this market vulnerable   he said. Traders noted that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's remarks today concerning the dollar's performance and its bearing on monetary policy  injected caution into many investors."

However  dealers said position squaring helped push the dollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks  up from the opening 1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55. Meanwhile  the pound was underpinned by today's opinion poll findings of further strong support for the Conservative Party  but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying. Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had needed to sell sterling to curb rises today  with the markets so quiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds yesterday. Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index  unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's finish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs  after an opening 1.6213/23 and previous close of 1.6163/73  and at 2.9490/520 marks  against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530. Traders said there was little hope that the Western financiers will be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of currency instability during the current series of talks in Washington. These are scheduled to start today with an informal Group of Five (G-5) session. Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting - of the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  France  the U.K.  Italy and Canada - is seen as the key meeting. Traders said few operators will be prepared to open positions ahead of news emerging from the talks. However  some traders said that  given the low level of expectations  the market could be particularly susceptible to signs of accord between the U.S. And Japan  which would give the dollar a sharp upward push. They said interest is still largely centred on the yen  with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that market first. Meanwhile  today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on the market. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall could be counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon  but there was little followthrough  traders said. The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen  up from an opening 145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10. It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs  against the start of 1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90  and at 6.0650/700 French francs  after beginning at 6.0525/75 and ending yesterday at 6.0660/710."
"1","Comex gold futures held pared gains atmidsession after the metal repeatedly stalled in the face of trade selling resistance  analysts said. They attributed gold's modest price rise to a buoyant silver market. Professional traders and investors again bought silver on speculation it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce. The pacesetting June gold delivery traded at 423.60 dlrs an ounce  up one dlr but below a session high of 425.20 dlrs. Other contracts were 80 cts to 1.50 dlrs firmer. Trading was thin as participants closely watched the foreign exchange and U.S. stock markets  brokers said."
"1","CBT soyproduct futures continued totrade higher in light midsession trade  with deferred months up most  supported by the strong tone in the nearby soybean pit  traders said.

Merrill Lynch and E.F. Hutton were the featured outright buyers of May soymeal  with Cargill spreading May/July at 0.20 dlr premium May  pit brokers said. Soyoil futures were up 0.11 to 0.15 cent per lb  supported by steady commercial buying."

A 2.5 point fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1030.5 further dampened sentiment after its strong advance over the past week  they added.

"1","Platinum futures were higher atmidsession as the precious metal continued to mirror the action in the nearby silver pit  analysts said. Silver was trading in the upper end of the day's wide range  bolstered by speculative buying on a belief that it would continue to rise toward seven dlrs an ounce basis May. The key July platinum delivery traded at 571.50 dlrs an ounce  up 2.90 dlrs but under a session high of 577.50 dlrs. Other months were 3.70 to 7.30 dlrs higher. However  trading was thin as many participants watched the foreign exchange and U.S. stock and bond markets. Meanwhile  palladium was up 70 cts to 2.20 dlrs in sympathetic buying to platinum."

"1","U.S. credit markets were mixed in dulltrading at midsession  with moderate losses in coupon issues and Treasury bill rates near unchanged. Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in U.S. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was not connected with Fed policy  dealers said. Coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower  pressured by a weak dollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis points lower to one basis point higher. The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32 to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close. Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further  sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his views. In any case  they said the dollar is expected to be under pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations meet this week in Washington  which may hurt bonds. Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts  but that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.  When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills  because it makes people think the Fed is not going to tighten   a bill trader said.  But it's a nervous trade  with no real buyers.  Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct  three basis points below their price at yesterday's auction  while six-month bills rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid. Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid. Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply temporary reserves  but most had forecasted an indirect injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed conducted at its usual intervention time. The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday  down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge. The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at midday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32."

"1","Live Hog futures ran up for sharp gainsafter midsession before slipping late to close 0.82 cent higher to 0.02 lower. Only February posted a loss while April and June paced the gain and April ended at 50.65 cents. Futures ran up early as demand prompted by strong live markets  light hog runs and the discount of futures to cash sparked technical buying. April ran up as much as 1.42 cents above its previous level before profit-taking developed  traders said. Gains in cash hogs reflected reduced farmer marketings as they took to the fields for the start of spring activities. The strength in live also offset a sharp break in cash ham prices. The break in hams was expected as Easter buying came to an end  they added."
"1","CBT soybean futures closed on a strongnote in new crop  showing gains of 4-3/4 to 9-1/4 cents per bushel in moderate trade. May settled at 5.04-1/2 dlrs after posting a 5-1/2 cent range  with November at 5.04-3/4. Slow country movement  steady to firmer cash soybean basis values and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to support futures from the opening  despite a disappointing drop in the weekly soybean export figure yesterday  traders said. The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish  which could limit declines when South American sales begin to pick up later this month  they added. A local house steadily bought new crop November  with another local house spreading July/Nov  pit brokers said."
"1","Hard wheat futures closed 1-1/4 to1/2 cents lower in light trading as exporter selling erased early gains to close the market near session lows  traders said. May closed 1-1/4 cents lower at 2.72-3/4 dlrs. Prices opened steady to higher on some follow-through buying from yesterday and hopes for new export sales in tenders scheduled this week. But selling by a major exporter brought prices off their highs  and the lack of strong buying interest reversed those gains. Volume remained generally thin with little other fresh news in the market. Cargill sold 1.0 mln bushels of May  and Staley bought May and July  pit brokers said. Some intra-market spreading was noted with players on both sides of July/December at 7-1/2 cents  they said."

"1","The dollar ended with modest net lossesagainst most major currencies as the market conducted a final round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings  dealers said.  The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to see if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then take it from there   said one dealer at a top European bank. As a result  generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded. The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen  down from 145.85/90. However  the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark  the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180 in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday. In Congressional testimony this morning  Fed Chairman Paul Volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline. He also said the dollar's fall  thus far  should be  large enough  in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S.  to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.  The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal.  It was the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as a defender of the currency   said one trader. The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long conversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this afternoon. Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to prop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.  Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only person who will make a difference is Baker   said Alan Rose of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.  The key question for the currency market is whether the (Reagan) administration will have a change of view on the dollar. If not  the dollar is going lower   he added. The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen was linked to the market's perception that Washington was unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least disruptive way of accelerating the process. While most analysts do not expect any marked change of attitude in Washington  they were reluctant to open any fresh positions until later in the week.  We are reserving judgement for the time being   said Doug Madison of Commerzbank Ag. The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling trading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at 1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday. However  underyling sentiment remains positive after a U.K. opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.  Sterling still seems to be on the firm side   said one dealer. The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger tone  rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from 1.3080/85 yesterday. According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co  the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below average market rates in 1980-82  compared with 5.5 pct yesterday."

"1","Firm oil prices  a sharp stock pricefall and widespread fear that the dollar has much more room to decline sent bond prices tumbling  dealers said. The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1-3/32 points to close at 95-1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basis points from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.  Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seems headed for eight pct within the next few days   a trader said. That would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8. Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points. Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4. Bond traders said the main negative is recent instability of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central bank support will not be able to prevent a further sharp decline in the U.S. currency. The dollar came under mild downward pressure early and finished with modest net losses. The currency was largely unaffected by generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Miyazawa once again said he and Treasury Secretary James Baker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the dollar's fall thus far should be  large enough  in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S.  to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.  Despite favorable comments by Volcker and Miyazawa  there appears to be broad agreement among currency and bond market participants that a huge Federal budget deficit and a wide  although narrowing  trade gap will further depress the dollar. That could mean Japanese and other foreign investors will buy fewer U.S. bonds or even start selling them. There has been no evidence of large-scale sales of U.S. bonds by the Japanese. Some dealers said that these investors actually purchased a modest amount of U.S. debt today  but they focused on shorter maturities in the two-year area rather than on long bonds. To the extent that overseas investors back away from the U.S. bond market  dealers said that higher yields will be needed to lure others to take their place. A late Federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to the bond market retreat. After averaging 6.20 pct yesterday  funds opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between 6-1/16 and 6-1/4 pct. The Federal funds rate rise occurred despite the Fed's unexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. The Fed arranged two-day System repurchase agreements with funds trading at 6-1/8 pct. Treasury bill rates increased largely in response to the higher funds rate. Rates on new three and six-month bills rose two and seven basis points from Monday's auction averages to close at 5.55/54 pct and 5.70/69 pct. Year bills at 5.81/80 pct were up eight basis points from yesterday's close. Among notes  the 6-3/8s of 1989 dropped 1/8 to 99-9/16  with the 7-1/4s of 1996 down 3/4 at 97-3/8."
"1","The dollar ended with modest net lossesagainst most major currencies as the market conducted a final round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings  dealers said.  The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to see if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then take it from there   said one dealer at a top European bank. As a result  generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded. The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen  down from 145.85/90. However  the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark  the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180 in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday. In Congressional testimony this morning  Fed Chairman Paul Volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline. He also said the dollar's fall  thus far  should be  large enough  in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S.  to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.  The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal.  It was the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as a defender of the currency   said one trader.

The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at 1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday. However  underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K. opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.  Sterling still seems to be on the firm side   said one dealer. The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger tone  rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from 1.3080/85 yesterday. According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co  the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below average market rates in 1980-82  compared with 5.5 pct yesterday."

Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points. Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4. Bond traders said the main negative is recent instability of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central bank support will not prevent a further drop in the dollar."

Dealers said there was still strong support for the unit and forecast it would test its recent highs after shrugging off yesterday's selling pressure. They said the dollar was better equipped to hold its current values as its U.S. Conterpart is significantly lower than the last time these levels were tested. A trading range of 0.7080 to 0.7120 U.S. Dlrs is expected today. In early Australian trade the US dollar was pegged at 1.8253/63 marks and 145.40/50 yen from its New York closes of 1.8270/80 and 145.60/70. Dealers said the market had become sceptical about the resolve of the major trading nations to assist the U.S. Out of its twin deficit problems. They forecast a quiet day for the currency.

The dollar is expected to move between 145.00 and 145.60 yen today as operators avoid taking big positions  despite low expectations from any Washington talks  dealers said. The dollar's upward potential looks limited as selling interest appears strong around 145.60 yen  they said. The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday. The dollar opened at 1.8245/50 marks against 1.8270/80 in New York. Sterling was unchanged from New York's 1.6175/85 dlr finish. The market is generally sceptical about the outcome of any G-5 or G-7 meeting in Washington and the dollar is likely to come under selling pressure which could push it towards 140 yen if no significant measures to stabilise currencies emerge  dealers said. They said Japan is expected to try to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability  but added they expect disagreement between Japan and other nations. Japanese officials travelling with Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Reuters the G-7 will meet today  but currency target zones or reference ranges will not be discussed. The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen  when a medium-sized trading house started to sell the dollar  dealers said.

The dollar opened at 1.8247/57 marks against New York's 1.8270/80 close and the 1.8205/15 finish here yesterday. The dollar opened at 145.40/50 yen but weakened to near 145.30 when the Bank of Japan intervened. It finished at 145.60/70 in New York and 145.15/20 here yesterday. Dealers said the dollar appeared to be holding comfortably above the critical 145 yen level now as yesterday's attempt to break that level failed for lack of momentum. But the markets generally are not expecting much from the Washington talks today  they added. The dollar is expected to stay within a tight range today with considerable selling pressure at the 145.60 yen and 1.8270 mark levels  dealers said. Dealers said supportive remarks yesterday from Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa were ignored as players squared positions. Volcker told a Congressional committee the dollar's fall so far should be  large enough ... To support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.  Miyazawa  after meeting Treasury Secretary James Baker  said they agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the U.S. Has played in supporting the dollar since the February Paris accord. Sterling opened at 1.6182/92 dlrs against New York's 1.6175/85 close and the 1.6200/10 finish here yesterday.

September was 110.10  below the earlier record of 110.15 and against a 109.40 close. The rally was triggered by a fall in short-term interest rates and heavy broker speculation in expectation of more end-investor purchases. But prices eased towards end-morning as the cash bond market fell on profit taking  dealers said. The yen unconditional call rate was 3.5000 pct today  down from 3.6250 pct yesterday. The Bank of Japan sold a total of 800 billion yen worth of financial bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1 300 billion yen due to allocation of government revenues to local governments and public entities and the return of bank notes.

"1","The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct  a central bank spokesman said. Banks  which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6. Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires  so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation. A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy  but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system. Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month  well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks. The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks  below the outgoing 14.9 billion  banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity. Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market  as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement  its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks. The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct  although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible  dealers said."

"1","OPEC's weekend decision to cut plannedoil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed market confidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the year and boosted international spot prices  oil traders said. Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrel higher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday and could continue their rise in the next few weeks  they said. The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd). At its previous meeting in December  OPEC set a provisional 16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed a sharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to back up its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was contemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling  spot prices of the most widely traded crude oil  Britain's Brent Blend  surged 30-40 cents a barrel. Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this morning in London  taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35 dlrs  compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week. Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly to news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies later in the year  when demand for oil increases with the onset of the Northern Hemisphere winter  and further rises in spot prices.  There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth quarters of this year  one trader said.  In the past three months we have already seen a rise in demand  particularly from the U.S.  And I expect to see even higher prices  he added. Mehdi Varzi  analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson in London  agreed. Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious in setting the new output ceilings.  There is now a great chance that Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next month   he said. Laurie Law  analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York  said over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the year from just over 20 dlrs now. WTI  the U.S. Benchmark crude  usually fetches a premium of 80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year  spot Brent has held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel. But some traders  fearing continued over-production by some OPEC members  sounded a note of caution over the new accord. Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement because other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand for the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq. In recent months Iraq has been producing 500 000 bpd above its assigned quota  and it could begin pumping a further 500 000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in September. According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah  actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be well above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd."
"1","In the fast paced personal computerindustry  millions can be made in six months  and such an opportunity may exist now for companies seeking to capitalize on the delay of a new IBM software standard. When International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> announced its new generation of personal computers  the PS/2 family  in April  it also decided to establish a new operating system for the machines  a death sentence for the billions of dollars of software now in use on the existing system. Because IBM is the world's largest computer company - some 70 pct of the world's computers bear the IBM logo - most industry analysts  and even IBM's competitors  expect that within two years the new operating system  called OS/2  will be as commonplace as the current standard  MS-DOS  is now.  By 1989  at least one half to 60 pct of all personal computers will be sold with OS/2   predicted George Colony  president of the consulting firm Forrester Research Inc. But until then there is an opportunity  some analysts said  for firms selling advanced versions of MS-DOS  specialised multi-tasking software packages and Unix  an alternative to MS-DOS developed by American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> that has developed a following among engineers and the federal government. OS-2  which IBM is developing with Microsoft Corp  the author of MS-DOS  will not be ready for another six months. IBM said last week that the product is on schedule but analysts and other software developers are skeptical  since delays in major new software products are commonplace. Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely be hindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendors alike  who would prefer to keep making products that work with tried and true MS-DOS  according to Paul Cubbage  software analyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc. Compaq  IBM's major personal computer competitor  has already said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaq president Rod Canion said recently their will be no  automatic mass migration  to OS/2.  (Advanced MS-DOS) applications will continue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2 will supply long after it becomes available   he said. Cubbage acknowledged that  it will probably be a year or more before any really useful applications are available for OS-2   creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs.  But there comes a time when the memory limits of those gets to you   he said. IBM's new operating system was as big an event to the computer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The new computers  the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's fast 80386 microprocessor  are expected to rejuvenate the sagging sales of the personal computer industry and already gave a big boost to IBM. Company officials said last week that 250 000 PS/2s were shipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM expect record pc sales ths year as a result. The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since the full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped until a new operating system or other high level software is available  analysts said. OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs  or tasks  at once on a personal computer  ideally without any slowdown in operation  a capability the industry has long strived for. Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2  in particular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking program  which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced version of the program  Windows 386  will be announced in September and available six to eight weeks later  at a price of 100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.  Some software developers have said the the program  designed for 80386-based personal computers  may even be superior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applications without disruption. But several analysts commented that what users really want is a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personal computers  and so far that desire has been met primarily by a small Atlanta software publisher  The Software Link Inc. In late spring the company announced PC-MOS/386  a multi-tasking  multiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS and works on 80386-based computers. The company said it filled 2 500 orders in the first four weeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40 000 by year end. International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix could be the most promising alternative to OS/2  even once the IVM system is available. IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models  although it did say that it would announce a version of its Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX)  a Unix compatible operating system. But the federal government requires Unix compatability for most of its computer contracts  it is almost certain that other companies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBM systems. ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix that is compatible with the 80386 microprocessor  although not IBM's computer specifically. Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unix accepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM system has a chance to take off."
"1","Kuwait  aided by the recovery in worldoil prices  announced a mildly expansionary budget for 1987/88 with a 3.3 pct rise in the deficit to 1.38 billion dinars. Oil revenues  slashed by some 40 pct in the original budget for the 1986/87 year ending tomorrow  were forecast to rise 4.2 pct to 1.73 billion dinars in 1987/88  Finance Minister Jassim al-Khorafi said. This would account for 87.2 pct of total estimated income in the year starting on July 1 compared with 86.6 pct in original 1986/87 estimates  the Kuwait News Agency Kuna quoted him as saying. Spending by ministries and public institutions is forecast to be 3.4 pct higher at 3.16 billion dinars in 1987/88 after an 11 pct cut in the current fiscal year's budget. In addition the government  as is usual  will transfer a sum equal to 10 pct of total expected revenue to a special savings reserve for future generations. The minister made no mention of how the deficit would be covered. He also gave no actual outturn for spending and income in 1986/87."
"1","Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has attackedbudget proposals made by the European Community's executive Commission  saying they ignore efforts to cut spending  and added that divisions over the issue would be hard to resolve at this week's EC summit. The Commission has proposed radical changes in the way the member countries contribute to the budget  suggesting payments should be linked to economic output instead of tax revenue. But the richer northern nations such as Britain  West Germany and France are insisting on stricter spending controls before agreeing to any reform.  The proposals of the Commission  at the level they are being made  are not compatible with the efforts which each of our nations is making to reduce spending ... Therefore there is a big problem   Chirac said in a radio interview. EC leaders would also try to resolve a dispute on reforms of agricultural spending  largely to blame for an expected 5.7 billion dlr shortfall in the EC budget this year. Chirac said that West Germany  under pressure from its powerful farm lobby  was alone in opposing reforms to the common agricultural policy  while France shared a common position on the issue with the 10 other EC states."

"1","Allis-Chalmers Corp said thecompany and its domestic affiliates filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The company said its business units outside the United States are not affected by the action. Allis-Chalmers said the rapid agreement was essential for its restructuring plan  announced March 4. However  the company said   agreement could not be worked out within the short time frame available  and it was determined that the only practical alternative was to obtain court protection.   This protection enables us to keep on operating our business in the ordinary course while affording us time to work out our obligations and complete our operational restructure strategy.  Allis-Chalmers said the proposal announced in March called for a complete restructuring of its obligations and capital structure as well as major structural changes in operations. The company said funds generated by U.S. operations are currently inadequate to meet its U.S. obligations  primarily due to the carryover from discontinued and drastically downsized businesses. It said funds produced by non-U.S. operations are not readily available to help meet those obligations  which include a health care program for retirees and debt service carried over from the larger Allis-Chalmers of earlier years. Allis-Chalmers said its U.S. cash flow exceeded a negative 24 mln dlrs in 1986 and was a negative two mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1987. The company has financed a portion of its debt service and other obligations through sales of assets and has relied on short-term waivers from its lenders to prevent defaults on principal and interest payments. Because of Allis-Chalmers' financial position  it said  new financing facilities were not available outside of Chapter 11  adding substantially all U.S. assets other than inventory are pledged as security for its debts."

"1","Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkovdescribed the Soviet Union's economic management system as obsolete and called on the Supreme Soviet  the nominal parliament  to adopt a draft law on major economic reform. In a speech to the 1 500 member body  Ryzhkov said excessive central control by Moscow-based ministries and wasteful use of resources had led to a situation where 13 pct of Soviet industrial enterprises were making a loss in 1986. He said the public faced acute food and housing problems and a  shadow economy  was growing because the state could not meet demand. He added that the USSR had failed to keep up with the technology revolution.  The methods of the past system of economic management have become obsolete   Ryzhkov declared.  The need for change is evident and urgent.  Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev  who set the tone last week with a frank speech on the economy  was present during the speech. The legislation outlined by Ryzhkov  formally called the draft law on state enterprises  is expected to be approved by the Supreme Soviet  to take effect next January 1. Under the law  all enterprises are to become financially self-supporting by taking charge of income and outlay  with wages tied to profit in order to increase worker incentive. Firms will compete for orders from the state  which are due to decline as direct contracts between enterprises expand. Ryzhkov said the state planning agency  Gosplan  would be restructured to set national economic priorities instead of administering factories directly through five year plans.  We need a fundamentally new approach to yearly planning   he added  saying annual central plans would be abandoned from 1991 and enterprises charged with developing their own plans.  He said scientific research should be integrated closely with industry to make up a technology gap with the West and enterprises should use market research to meet consumer demand. Ryzhkov blamed the state supply body  Gossnab  for allowing shortages to occur. He said Gossnab was hoarding 27 billion roubles worth of raw materials and semi-finished products of enterprises. He said Gossnab should help expand wholesale trade. Ryzhkov said improved economic management of consumer goods and services was required to stem increasing speculation and the growth of the black market economy. He called for a 10 fold increase in the number of cooperatives to help in this field. He said the price system needed radical revision to accurately reflect supply and demand  with the state setting prices only for  products of national importance  in changes to be fully in place by the next five year plan beginning in 1991. The practice of using credit to cover losses must also stop. Outstanding debts to the state had reached 40 billion roubles. He said there were proposals to replace the  cumbersome  banking system with six new banks -- a state bank and banks for foreign economic relations  agro-industry  construction  housing and commercial services  and credit. Ryzhkov said guarantees should be built into the law to prevent  the distortion of the rights of enterprises.  But non-profitable enterprises would be declared bankrupt if efforts to make them self-supporting failed. Bemoaning the  economic illiteracy  of many managers  he called for the retraining of economic personnel. Ryzhkov said an immense amount of work lay ahead and  doing it on the go  would be difficult  but added   We do not have time to stop and ponder.  He said the changes should  give a new image to socialism."

"1","West Germany's foreign trade and currentaccount surpluses are expected to decline only slightly in 1987 from their record levels last year  economists said. Figures released by the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden showed that in the first five months of the year the trade surplus grew 15.7 pct compared with the same 1986 period to 47.2 billion marks. The current account surplus rose 9.8 pct to 33.7 billion marks. West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77 billion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks. Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-ago levels to have started biting more strongly into the nominal surpluses. The real surpluses are already declining. The Statistics Office said after cheaper import prices were taken into consideration  West Germany's imports by volume rose by more than three pct in the first five months. Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. The government has pointed to this stronger real rise in imports than exports when rejecting international pressure to boost domestic consumption. The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus had risen in May to 10.6 billion marks  from 8.9 billion in April and 8.1 billion in May last year. The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marks in May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a year earlier. Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to 43.31 billion marks  while May imports of 32.76 billion marks had risen only 0.8 pct in the year. The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in a study published today that the trade surplus would probably only fall to around 101 billion marks this year  compared with the 113 billion mark 1986 record. It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61 billion marks from 77 billion. Ifo said this reduction would only be  a small step on the way to reducing imbalances in the world economy.  Peter Pietsch  an economist with Commerzbank AG  predicted a 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightly higher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billion marks.

In a letter dated June 26  the SEC's general counsel told attorneys representing Texaco and Pennzoil the commission will urge the Texas Supreme Court to review the issue of federal securities law in the Texaco-Pennzoil case  Texaco said.  This is to inform you that the commission has determined to file a brief amicus curiae in the (Texaco-Pennzoil) litigation. The brief will focus on Commission Rule 10b-13 as it applies to the facts of this case  and will urge the Texas Supreme Court to accept the case for review with respect to that issue   the letter said. The SEC's general counsel said   we currently anticipate that the brief will be filed around the week of July 20.  An issue concerning SEC Rule 10b-13 is part of Texaco's application for a Writ of Error  which was filed with the Texas Supreme Court on June 15  the company said.  The SEC rule prohibits private agreements or arrangements to purchase a target company's stock while a tender offer by a prospective purchaser is pending   the company's statement said.  In its application to the Texas Supreme Court  Texaco said  it points out that  on the day that Pennzoil made its alleged agreement to purchase Getty Oil stock (Jan. 3  1984)  it (Pennzoil) had outstanding a public tender offer for Getty Oil stock."

"1","European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker  who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings  were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday  they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct  and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores  to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins  and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds  a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers  all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions  maintained entrenched positions yesterday  making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in a notional common currency  are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area  saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which  while not having the status of a compromise proposal  would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle  with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns  and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically  is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for."

"1","European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman  Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker  told a news conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks  with the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served little more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex package of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would result in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European currency units  to help the EC's cash crisis  and changes in the conversion of EC common farm prices into national currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and Dutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences between EC states on the oils tax proposal  the currency measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated measures. But he told journalists   We have used this meeting to reach the point at which real negotiations can start at the next meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our procedures took much longer than planned.  Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package by April 1 each year  although this target is seldom reached in practice. Diplomats said on all the points there were widely diverging views  with Britain and the Netherlands  the countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals price cuts  strongly opposed to the oils tax. However  de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to resolve.  This is a very tough political nut  and because of the very nature of the problem there is no technical solution   he said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his proposals to make an agreement easier. However  because of the EC's budgetary crisis  he had little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers  led by Germany's Ignaz Kiechle  are demanding. EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five billion Ecus by the end of this year  even if the commission farm price package is adopted in its entirety."
"1","Belgian Agriculture Minister Paul deKeersmaeker said he would review EC Commission proposals for a tax on imported and EC produced vegetable oils and fats in the light of objections made by certain EC member states. De Keersmaeker  current chairman of the EC farm ministers' council  was speaking after a three-day meeting of ministers at which the tax proposal was one of the key themes. He said he would review the position as part of plans to present compromise proposals for the 1987/88 farm price package to the next meeting  starting in Brussels on May 18. De Keersmaeker  who said there was  a great deal of resistance in many delegations  to the tax  declined to say what aspects of the proposals he would review. However  EC Commission sources said they are expected to include the question of whether it should apply to marine oils. They said Denmark and Portugal might agree to the tax  to be set initially at 330 Ecus a tonne  if these oils  of which they are major producers  were excluded. The sources said  however  that Britain  the Netherlands and West Germany continue to have strong objections to the tax  partly because of fears that its impact on U.S. Soybean exports could provoke transatlantic trade friction. They said that  if these three countries held firm to this position  they would be able to block the proposal under the EC's majority voting mechanism."

"1","Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30  Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens said today. Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm price package which has endured since March. Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had to be referred to heads of government. These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and vegetable fats and oils  and proposals to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in European currency units (Ecus)  are translated into the currencies of member states. The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S.  A major exporter of soybeans to the EC. West Germany  meanwhile  is strongly against the technical currency move  which would result in additional price cuts for farmers in countries with strong currencies  such as the mark. Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean heads of government diverting their attention from much more important world and Community issues. Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest themselves in such technically complex questions. However  Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some nuances in member state positions  which may make the dialogue more constructive in the next few weeks.  If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month  the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct cut in cereals prices  farm trade sources said. It originally proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this year  with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops. Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency reforms. The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year. Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's meeting very useful  diplomats said there was little sign of a major shift in the position of member states  or of finance ministers adopting a different line from that of their agriculture colleagues. The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their differences."
"1","The European Community (EC) executiveCommission will today urgently consider whether to take a new initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis. The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in Luxembourg Monday. Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for 1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were first announced in March. The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted into member state currencies. West German delegation sources  who have opposed both plans fiercely  said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax plan and modified the currency proposals  there would be a chance of agreement on other aspects of the package. These include measures to cut the effective price paid to farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct. But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would include plans for revising the current oils and fats and currency regulations. The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at the end of the month. Commission president Jacques Delors  who wants to ensure the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means of financing the cash-strapped EC  said yesterday it would be  disastrous  if farm issues had to be discussed by government leaders. However  with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75 billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year  the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the traditionally free-spending farm ministers  diplomats said Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens  who chaired yesterday's joint meeting of ministers  said afterwards some aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to be referred to the summit. Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as useful in clarifying the issues  some diplomats said it seemed to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions. Indeed  they said an extra state  Spain  seemed to have lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and fats tax  West Germany  Britain  Denmark and Portugal."
"1","The EC Commission has proposed amodified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fats in its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals  an official document detailing the proposals shows. The document  made available to journalists  says the commission proposes that the tax should start at levels originally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1. However  the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50 pct from originally envisaged levels  the document said. In addition  the Commission proposes that the level of the tax  expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne  could be reviewed every three months rather than annually. Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals for fish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections to the tax from Portugal and Spain  major fishing nations. Other countries opposing the tax include Britain  West Germany and Denmark. The new proposals retain most of the Commission's original plans in other sectors. However  they mark the Commission's recognition that it cannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention for cereals  diplomats said. Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthly increments applied to cereals during the November to May period when intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheat and two Ecus a tonne for other cereals. The document shows the Commission has also changed its green currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition  notably from West Germany. West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points  with a further one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season. The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantling of positive MCAs. For other countries  the Commission makes the following proposals for dismantling negative MCAs Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points for animal products and just over two points for crops. France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for an extra 1.5 point cut for beef. Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created since January 12. Britain - five point cut for most products  6.5 points for beef. Greece  Spain and Portugal - for most products  dismantling of seven  14 and 5.5 points respectively."

"2","Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone  alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao  although normal humidity levels have not been restored  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155 221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers  middlemen  exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1 750 to 1 780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1 850 and 1 880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july  Aug/Sept at 1 870  1 875 and 1 880 dlrs per tonne FOB.

Destinations were the U.S.  Covertible currency areas  Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April  785 dlrs for May  753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.

Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone  BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.  The circumstances at the time will determine what we do   said Arthur Miller  BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications  when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.  I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could   said Lawrence Cohn  analyst with Merrill Lynch  Pierce  Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits  the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer  most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders  noted Daniel Williams  analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter  the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless  BankAmerica  which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans  stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt  and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year  said Joseph Arsenio  analyst with Birr  Wilson and Co. He noted  however  that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt  the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured  similar to way Mexico's debt was  minimizing losses to the creditor banks."

"2","Venezuela and its bank advisorycommittee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February  bankers said. They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms. The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today  the bankers said.  A number of details have still to be finalized  but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place   one senior banker said. The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates  but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987  1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela. The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks  which have been going on intermittently for several months  follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel. And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package  including a 7.7 billion dlr loan  will be signed on March 20. While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental  bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swift deals  banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil."

"2","The Tower Commission report  whichsays President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal  just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington  political analysts said.  This is certification of incompetence   private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today.  It's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials.  In one of the most direct criticisms  board chairman John Tower  a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas  told a press conference   The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.  The report  which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government  was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing. The three-member panel made up of Tower  former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie  does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.  We're falling by our own hand   said one Republican political strategist.  What can we say except 'we're sorry  we won't do it again'?  The strategist  who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified  said the report was like  an anvil falling on us.  Hess  with the Brookings Institution public policy study group  said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress  the press and the Washington bureaucracy. The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz  who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president.  They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences   it said. White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism  but the blows were expected in their cases. Regan  expected to resign or be fired shortly  was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid  chaos  in the disclosure process. Casey  who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December  had already resigned for health reasons last month.  This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes   Tower told reporters. While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers  including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation  analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats. The crucial remaining question  they said  is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair. Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November  his personal popularity is still relatively high. A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government  but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider  a Democrat  says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.  In the past  he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public   Schneider said. Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround.  The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met   said the strategist  who requested anonymity.  They have to recognize there is no quick fix.  Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats."

Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to 70 pct   he told reporters.  I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports.  U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities.  By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology  technology that is truly critical  we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports   Cranston said.

This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs  maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder   an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer  announced before the opening today  expires March 25.  This is totally by surprise   said Debra Strohmaier  a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready. She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.  I think they will resist it   said Elliott Schlang  analyst at Prescott  Ball and Turben Inc.  Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would.  Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management. Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested. ChemLawn  with about two mln customers  is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers  pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes. Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system. Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed. Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year  and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter. Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice."
"2","Sugar imports subject to the U.S.sugar import quota during the week ended January 9  the initial week of the 1987 sugar quota year  totaled 5 988 short tons versus 46 254 tons the previous week  the Agriculture Department said. The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year (January-December) has been set at 1 001 430 short tons compared with 1 850 000 tons in the 1986 quota year  which was extended three months to December 31.

"2","inflationplan  initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy  is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices  widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis. Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices  fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate. But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.  The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation  at least the economy worked   a leading bank economist said. The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat  with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln."

"2","A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. Januarydurable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of 1987  economists said. With total orders  excluding the volatile defense sector  falling a record 9.9 pct  economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy. But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment.  It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy  said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc.  I'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought.  The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.  It's more expensive to invest than it used to be  so people just aren't doing it as much   Wyss said. Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws  economists said. November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's increased 1.5 pct  revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct. But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform.  The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December   said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.   The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters   said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November  order backlogs rose 0.6 pct  but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct  he said.  It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting  which may quickly translate to a drop in production   Midland Montagu's Maude said. Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of January's report  given that other reports have reflected strength. But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders  compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December. He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments  compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.  Given these numbers  there's no reason for the Fed to tighten   Data Resources' Wyss said.  But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see   he added. Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter.  People aren't talking recession or Fed easing now  but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth."
"2","Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) andDaniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.  Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security  and eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority over the licensing process   Cranston said.  Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to 70 pct   he told reporters.  I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports.  U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities.  By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology  technology that is truly critical  we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports   Cranston said.  We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place   Evans told reporters."

Baglini  an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks  told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request. Baglini said that as a result  today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed. He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil  which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt. Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth  which has been targeted at four pct in 1987  Baglini said.  Debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets  that is their commercial balance  to meet interest payments   he added."
"2","The chairmen and senior Republicanmembers of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991. If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26  1987. The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill)  Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn)  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore). In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years. He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement   The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die.  He added   The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however  the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated.  He added   The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose."

"2","Quebecor Inc  one of Canada's largestpublishing and printing companies  is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal  probably this fall  president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview. The company  which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue Inc>  will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane  Quebec  Peladeau said.  I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will   he said  adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week. Quebecor  which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs  already publishes three daily newspapers  including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal  the second-largest circulation paper in Canada. A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper  making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America  analysts have said. Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50 000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers. Peladeau  who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor  said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture. He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.  It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term   Peladeau said. Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue  which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct.  In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper   Peladeau said.  When I lived that  I said to myself...next time we'll be ready.  Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint capacity however  is already committed to other buyers. Quebecor uses about 100 000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell's company  which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper  uses about 200 000 tonnes. Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine  49 pct owned by the New York Times  (NYT.A)  adding to Donohue's 540 000 metric tonne capacity this fall  the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos  Quebec  or build another mill to meet their demands . He said a new mill  which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper  would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane  a depressed area with high unemployment  would be heavily subsidized by the government. Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell's company  either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S.  where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. He said Maxwell's sons  who are French citizens  would provide an entree into the French market  where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S. Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers  with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S.  and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada  Peladeau said. He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing."

"2","Iran announced tonight that its majoroffensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the Baghdad government. The Iranian news agency IRNA  in a report received in London  said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over. It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had  dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war.  The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq.  The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...   said the statement quoted by IRNA. It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to  come to their senses  and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq. Iran said its forces had  liberated  155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands  townships  rivers and part of a road leading into Basra. The Iranian forces  are in full control of these areas   the statement said. It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed  along with 700 tanks and 1 500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed  250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers."

"2","U.S. bank discount window borrowingsless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25  the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs  with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25  the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day  down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been  acting a bit strangely  for this time of year  noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday  for which he could give no reason  to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float  but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole  he said that float related as of adjustments were  small   adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday  two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However  he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday  45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks  with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday  55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks  with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday  Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period  he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge  almost all of which were at the smallest banks."
"2","American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc  but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor  as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value  thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8  up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting  company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson  according to analysts. Yesterday  Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer  Jeffery Lane  to the added position of president  which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense  contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts  however  disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express  contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year.  I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson   said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than  a very profitable securities firm.  Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash  which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson  and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past.  Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization   said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally.  They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road   said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.  They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future  which goes heavily into the international arena   said Lewis.  ...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way   he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson  its stock might better reflect other assets  such as the travel related services business.  It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company   he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings  up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985."

"2","A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays  administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments  a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)  former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report  which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash  is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates  said the GAO source  depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures  then the net cost of the program would go up. However  if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease  the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded  the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates  will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program   an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program  while USDA remains firmly committed to it."
"2","venezuela is seeking a 'constructive andflexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt  finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say   they are progressing.  Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments  but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today  which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor  azpurua said only   that is good news.  According to banking sources  the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants. Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction  deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988  lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule  and debt capitalization schemes. Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling  and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal  both public sector. He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year  but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year  but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans.  debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed   azpurua said. However  he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments   because circumstances change too quickly.  At the same time  he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt  based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank."

"2","OPEC may be forced to meet before ascheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices  oil industry analysts said.  The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems   said Daniel Yergin  director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.  OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way   said Paul Mlotok  oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.  OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas  fixed prices and set differentials   said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named.  The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again   he added. David T. Mizrahi  editor of Mideast reports  expects OPEC to meet before June  although not immediately. However  he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.  They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil  but in late March and April when demand slackens   Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.  Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.  OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then   said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.  Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production   he told Reuters in a telephone interview."

"2","Brazil's 14-bank advisory committeeexpressed  grave concern  to chief debt negotiator Antonio Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest payments  according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank to creditor banks worldwide. Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines. Seixas  director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign debt department  met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.

"2","Liquefied natural gas imports fromAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible  U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi  director-general of Sonatrach  the Algerian state petroleum agency  indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year.  Contract negotiations  filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989   Daniel Tulis  a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers  Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas  a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export  company officials told Reuters. A third  El Paso Gas  a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>  has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible.  On a marginal cost basis  the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment    Frank Spadine  an energy economist with Bankers Trust  said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices  Shearson's Tulis said. In this context  Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production  he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values."
"2","The chairman of the Senate Agriculturesubcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its regulator do not ask for help by then.  We're going to have a bill to markup  I guarantee you  before the Easter recess   Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said. Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11  when Congress is scheduled to break for Easter  Boren said. Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA)  the system's regulator  to quickly make a formal request for aid. Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress  the FCA  as regulator  is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. However  FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action  he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of the three-man FCA board  Marvin Duncan  agreed. But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify aid is needed  it should request help informally.  We all know we need a capital infusion   Boren said. Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing  Brent Beesely  chief executive of the Farm Credit Council representing the system  said that at the end of 1986 the system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years. While he did not ask for government aid  Beesley indicated the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.  A significant number of banks and associations in the most economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer extraordinary losses   Beesley said. Jim Billington  Democratic member of the FCA board  said the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay loans. The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year. FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.  The bondholders have no worry at this time   Billington said. Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation of the system into a centralized national lender  to de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions. But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors. Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent could be developed without Congressional legislation."
"2","The Tower Commission's scathingcomments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure  but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November. But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger  who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it  had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.  Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or  if they could not in conscience do that  to so inform the president   the report said after a three-month probe.  Instead  they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.  The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan  a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and  perhaps more importantly  Reagan's wife Nancy.  More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory  he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser   said the report. Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission's findings next week. With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office  the report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole  a key Reagan ally  told reporters the report disclosed  colossal blunders  and said people who had not served the president well should step aside  but he did not specify who should go.  It would seem to me that if you don't protect the president  you don't serve the president well  then you should move on   the Kansas Republican  a likely presidential candidate next year  said. One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future."
"2","Switzerland's economy  combining lowunemployment  financial stability and a large external payments surplus  is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government  it said. The OECD  in its annual report on Switzerland  picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year  but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce  leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct  the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year  against 1.69 in the second half of 1986  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last  reflecting buoyant private consumption  meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But  given Switzerland's large external surplus  there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which  if only in a small way  would contribute to improving international balances   the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year  with a 3.25 pct growth rate  after several years of relative weakness  it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate  but should still outstrip overall GDP  it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987  and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors  it said. As a consequence  growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry  two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc  and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets  could lead to a loss of international market share for both  it said. Particularly for the banks   recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system  which has shown substantial flexibility in the past  is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position   it said."
"2","The U.S. Agriculture Department is notactively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP)  senior USDA officials said. However  grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made  though not in the very near future.  The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again   an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.  But there just isn't much talk about it  informally or formally.  Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets  even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow  it could take several months.  I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process   the aide to Lyng said.  An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight   said one former USDA official  who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress  a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday  House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group  comprised of subcabinet-level officials  has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP  officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week  the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of  calm  basic  factual economics.  Another USDA official said there was  not even an informal suggestion or hint  that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair."
"2","The U.S. Treasury said it was willingto participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina. The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply. Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.  Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position   the Treassury statement said. In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze  Argentine officials said the country needed  a more serene climate  to carry out structural changes in the economy. But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts  as neighboring Brazil did last week. The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18.  Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program   the statement said. The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze to restrain inflation. The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days. Along with new financing  Argentina reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of the money is loaned in Argentina."

"2","Brazil's 14-bank advisory committeeexpressed  grave concern  to chief debt negotiator Antonio Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest payments  according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank to creditor banks worldwide. Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines. Seixas  director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign debt department  met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday. Seixas  who met again this morning with senior Citibank executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc  told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits. The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today  bankers said. Despite the rising tempers  bankers said there are no plans for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday. Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.

The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the drug caused birth defects. Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials involving the drug  10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany. It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were obtained in eight of the trials  one of which included about 1 150 plaintiffs. In two trials  Merrell said  verdicts were in favor of the plaintiffs. In one  it said  the trial judge overruled the jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of this case by the full Court of Appeals. Of the remaining two trials  one ended in a mistrial and in the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict. At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging the drug caused birth defects  said a company spokesman. He said about 300 lawsuits are pending. Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s  and the Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the company decide it wants to reintroduce it."

The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation standards of its own. Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham  Long Island  N.Y.  and Seabrook  N.H.  had refused to take part in evacuation planning  as required under existing NRC rules. They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe evacuation plan  holding up the NRC's authority to issue full power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants. A group of prominent politicians  led by New York Governor Mario Cuomo  charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting the utilties'investments than protecting public safety. An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan. In a statement today announcing its vote  the commission said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency evacuation planning."

"2","The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks  accelerating in recent days  has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels  down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher  prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However  much of that export demand seems to have been met  with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter  so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest  soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks  setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.  Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May  looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow  which would cause March to gain on deferreds)   one CBT crush trader said.  But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered  if not tomorrow  then later in the month   he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal  the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today  dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents  so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level  the trader said. Hopefully  they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand  he added. With futures down  processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans  further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices  down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production  cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation  with little talk of taking temporary down-time  so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins  they added."

"2","Latest Federal Reserve data suggest thatthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago  money market economists said.  The numbers were a little disappointing  but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed   said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy  has been unchanged up to today.  Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar  many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data  which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year  economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs  economists said.  The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday   said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago.  But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.   The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had  it would have missed its (reserve) projections   added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window  which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week  compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole  the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period.  There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday  so I am not too bothered about the borrowings   said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system  economists said.  For the time being  the Fed is following a neutral path  with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct   said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp.  I expect it to continue in that vein.   Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs   added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period  down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week  little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead  economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.  The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy   said First Chicago's Johnson.  Of course  it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak  it won't pull back from easing."

"2","Japan has pledged to try to increaseits purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases  the Commerce Department said. U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade. Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases  a Commerce department official said. He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders. The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that  statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers.  It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985  U.S. firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market."
"2","France's right wing government is facinggrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation  budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members  raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year  perhaps in the autumn  to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.  The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago   said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais.  We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.   The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained   he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year  with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation  Edmond Maire  meeting with Chirac today  renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. Calling the government's policies  unbalanced and unjust   he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron  a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group  put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT  the largest of France's unions  declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month  and still rising  government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.  Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that   commented Michel Develle  economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year  partly blamed by the government for higher inflation  had undermined the unions power and popularity  he said. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast  perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.  But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed   he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that  so long as the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year  fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute  INSEE   Marais said. But the second half year should be better  he added. Ironically  one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit  several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down  higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth  they said."

"2","Monetary and credit growth rates inNew Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year  Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.

Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September. Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.  Available evidence suggests that corporate customers  including non-bank financial institutions  have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market   Russell said."

"2","Japanese life insurers  trust banks andcorporations  largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years  are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S.  Britain  France and Hong Kong  fund managers said. After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years  Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments  they said. Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986  Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd  said. Matsumoto  who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy  said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year  but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs  he added. This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets  Matsumoto said.  The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market  first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years   said Eugene Atkinson  managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity  enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk  he added. However  few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay  fund managers said. Institutions  particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders  are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries  but will put in less money  said Shinichi Kobuse  manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities. There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors  but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive  he added. Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations  he added. Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies  which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities  hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S.  But will now invest in Britain  West Germany  France and other countries  Hashimoto said. Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen  the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks  he added. One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds  he said. Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase  said Andrew Sheaf  general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan.  Last week was the busiest week we had   he said. Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms  fund managers said. Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest  but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc  they said. Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability  they added. Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany  particularly as German firms  like their Japanese counterparts  are concerned about the recent dollar fall. Australia also poses some risks due to currency values  they added."
"2","The combined assets of Taiwan's offshorebanking units (obu) rose to 6.28 billion U.S. Dlrs at end- January from 6.21 billion in December and 6.34 billion in January 1986  the central bank said. A bank official told Reuters the increase came mainly from increased local obu borrowings from their Asian counterparts. He said the assets  held by 15 foreign and local banks  were mainly in U.S. Dollars with the remainder in certificates of deposit and bonds. About 90 pct of the assets came from Asia and the rest from North America and Europe  he added."
"2","Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris  Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law  which should be approved by parliament on March 3  abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses  they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank  People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates  the sources said. However  it was impossible for them to follow the last cut  to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28  because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy  they said. On Tuesday  the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct  effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau  the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare  the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate  the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds  minus 0.1 percentage points  is the likeliest choice  they added."

Strong opposition objection to government tax reform proposals including a controversial sales tax has delayed deliberation by the Lower House Budget Committee."
"2","Domestic demand is now expected to makeno contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87  ending June 30  while net exports will account for all of the overall increase  Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However  he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.  The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower  around 14 billion   he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track  Keating said.  They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time   he said.  On the other hand  net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time  and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.  Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.  Nevertheless  there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane   he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.  The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88   Keating said.  As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further  and given continued effective wage restraint  inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88   he said."

"2","Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today  with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However  delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme  delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers  want to have the ball only in their court and it isn t fair   minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1  using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares  with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30  delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo  allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market  Colombia 17 pct  Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct  with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability  using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share  and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share  delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package.  Anything is possible at this phase   even adjournment of the meeting until March or April  one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas  the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result  industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled  so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either  they said."

"2","Britain s ruling Conservatives haveenlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party  according to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday.

"2","Indonesia s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987  against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines  the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia s staple food  rice  is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986  according to the annual report on Indonesia s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes  with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.  Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane  rubber and copra show little or no gain   the report says.  The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans  palm oil and palm kernels.  Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds  limited fertile land  insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops  the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as  wereng  or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties  and to use lower-yielding  more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee  tea  rubber  plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln  with exports rising to an estimated 720 000 tonnes from 695 000 tonnes in 1986  the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980 000 in 1986/87  imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat  soybeans  soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate  the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump."
"2","Kuwait s Oil Minister  in remarkspublished today  said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying:  None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Kuwait  they said  was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.  This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability  it will do so   the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.  If we can sell more than our quota at official prices  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share  it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever   he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar  which industry sources said was selling less than 180 000 bpd of its 285 000 bpd quota  because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered  a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.  Because it was charging its official price  of 16.67 dlrs a barrel  it had lost custom  he said but did not elaborate. However  Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad  he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body s members. Ecuador s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude  and was to seek this at talks this month of opec s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members  in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar  he said:  We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.  But he expected the situation would later improve."
"2","Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy  the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues  the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia  the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer  has been severely hit by last year s fall in world oil prices  which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.  (It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation  both as it pertains to investments and imports   the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia s agricultural sector  but also reviews the country s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation   there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.   This group strongly favours an import substitution economy   the report says. Indonesia s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected  and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May  which broadened areas for foreign investment  reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero  and the economy may even have contracted a bit.  This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s   the report notes. Indonesia  the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million  is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook.  For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.   Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity  real declines in construction and trade  and a reduced level of growth in agriculture   the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform  the Bank said."
"2","Opposition politicians  businessmenand newspapers criticised India s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees. They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform. But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express  the country s biggest selling paper  said:  The defence cow has never been holier.  The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget  shamelessly political.  It said in a front page commentary the  budget is bad for growth  bad for prices  bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else.  Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them. Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. Reaction in Bombay  India s business capital  was generally unfavourable. Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. Nalin Vissanji  President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange  India s biggest  fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax. Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come."

Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation. A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity. Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4  5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven  six yesterday. One  three  and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8  3/8  7-1/8  6-7/8 and 7-3/8  1/8 pct respectively. The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday."

"2","The Gulf oil state of Qatar  recoveringslightly from last year's decline in world oil prices  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today  Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals  down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings  social services  health  education  transport and communications  electricity and water  industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar  an OPEC member  has an output ceiling of 285 000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said:  Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends  foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth  have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."
"2","Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade  but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind  &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate  foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.  Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts   he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets  stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.  Nevertheless  bond and stock markets remain  to a large extent  fragmented and lagging behind   he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange  while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf  governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges  Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had  clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.  In addition  family firms are reluctant to go public  financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain  Kuwait  Qatar  Oman  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction  with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is  no bond market to speak of  in Saudi Arabia  Qatar  Oman or the UAE  with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up  establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar  Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent  Azzam said."
"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerreiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market  the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices  Nazer said Saudi Arabia  is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.  Nazer  quoted by SPA  said recent pressure on free market prices  may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.  Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord  under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets  which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica  OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman  who is also Nigerian Oil Minister  said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.  We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market  but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions   he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister  Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah  said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing."
"2","The International Coffee Organization(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night  but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. The special meeting  called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices  was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement  delegates said. The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September  they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system  delegates said. Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter."

"2","The U.S. Economy continued to expand inFebruary but at a slower pace than in January  which saw a spurt of activity  the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report. The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January  the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The  NAPM report  based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies  also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. But production remained vigorous  with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month  but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production. The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth straight month  more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices  this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz  chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee  said:  The economy continued to expand in February  but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter.  The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure  based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders  production  vendor deliveries  inventories and employment."

"2","Zambia will retain its foreign-exchangeauction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24  President Kenneth Kaunda said.  We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all   he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and  he hoped  would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector  he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders  and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar."
"2","Poland's talks in Washington with theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete  open and frank  a senior Polish banker was quoted as saying. Wladyslaw Baka  head of Poland's National Bank  told the official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.  Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for Poland's difficult economic position   PAP quoted Baka as saying. Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial obligations to the U.S.   but not in a short time  and not without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.  Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June  after a 36-year absence  IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions.

"2","Indonesia's raw sugar output is likelyto be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987  unchanged from 1986 and below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln  the U.S. Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987. Indonesia bought 162 500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986  the report said. The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes  against a government estimate of 1.99 mln. It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived. The report said   The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers.  However  there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops."

"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers  Community officials said. The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's Brussels Commission  which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses  which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy  demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals  over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil  Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year  an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices  coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms  which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the  green  exchange rate system  which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax  of up to 330 Ecus per tonne  would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds  but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States  which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes  which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line."
"2","&lt;Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firmorder with Boeing Co &lt;BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost of 250 mln Australian dlrs each  chairman Jim Leslie said. The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others arriving in May  June and September of that year  he said in a statement. The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747 family  he said. The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet to 28  he said. Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will announce a decision on engine purchases later this year. He said they are United Technologies Corp &lt;UTX> unit &lt;Pratt^M and Whitney>  General Electric Co &lt;GE> and Britain's &lt;Rolls-Royce^M Ltd>. He said the 747-400  which incorporates new technology such as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced electronics  should have its first flight next February. The 400 series has a designed range of 12 500 kms  2 140 kms further than the current Qantas 747-300's  he said. The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings  and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years  Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870 000 pounds  up from 833 000 for the 300 series  and offers an eight pct fuel saving  he said. The higher range and payload means they will first be used on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia. They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney and Los Angeles."

"2","An earthquake measuring 6.5 on theRichter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas  officials and seismologists said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas. The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated. A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16 000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged. No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip. Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes  the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks. The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island. Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week. Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links. Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam  32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina  the largest earth dam in the North Island."
"2","Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpinstarts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory committee in New York tomorrow  buoyed by an economy on the mend and political stability one year after President Corazon Aquino took power  central bank officials said. The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs  rescheduled in a 1985 accord  to any new agreement  the officials said. Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the Philippines  despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week  the officials said. Manila  which has not made any principal repayments since 1983  wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue. Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate  which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct. The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7. Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments. One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type accord  which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing to endorse five months after it was signed. In Manila's case  about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks on the advisory committee  while about 180 smaller banks have average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each."

"2","Saudi crude oil output last month fellto an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January  Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week  the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage  which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers  the four ex-partners of Aramco  the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>  Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month  when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100 000 bpd last month  compared to zero in January  while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200 000 bpd each."
"2","Indonesia's palm oil output is expectedto rise and exports to increase  the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector. The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in 1988  up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln in 1985. The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes. A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes  against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.  More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes   the report said. The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax  the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year. Exports are forecast to rise to 720 000 tonnes against 695 000 tonnes in 1986  the report added."
"2","Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoawill continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality  the U.S. Embassy said. The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86. In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags  but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags. The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the  probable  re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation. Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32 378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10 284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50 000 tonnes by 1988. Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35 000 tonnes  as against 38 000 tonnes in 1987. The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35 000 tonnes this year  from 33 000 tonnes in 1986 and 31 000 in 1985. The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans. The report forecasts that in calendar 1987  Indonesia's CTC (crushed  torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants. Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea  the main component of tea bags. Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125 000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123 000 tonnes in 1986. Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95 000 tonnes in 1987 from 85 000 in 1986 and around 90 000 in 1985. The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market."
"2","The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System  banking sources said. The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York authorities. Gordon Macklin  president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington  said he was very optimistic about an early agreement  possibly by the end of this month. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges  and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed. Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading  with Singapore filling a gap when no trading takes place. A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start of three-centre trading to determine investor interest. The Singapore  London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones  but some details still have to be worked out  a senior Singapore bank director said. Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres. But if agreement is reached  Singapore will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong  Toyko and Australia  he said. On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ)  modelled on NASDAQ. At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company  the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd (SNP)  but its turnover has been fairly active  and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon. Market sources expect the next few companies listed will also be government-owned entities  which would have no problem meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon  they said. SNP  previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd  issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times. In SESDAQ trading  SNP shares have advanced from an initial 1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far more than 900 000 shares have traded."

"2","After an onslaught of new paper  fewermark eurobonds issues are expected this week  bankers said. Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.  We want to have a week's pause   one manager said. Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks  including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks  from 3.6 billion in January. The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.  I think the D-mark market is still good  but only if you can give a good coupon   another manager said. But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone  bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday  although prices had recovered from initial lows. Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price  and Iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed  but traded Friday within fees at 98.15  98.50 from its par price. Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues  a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens  traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price  thanks mainly to its shorter maturity  dealers said. The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system  which they say is too inflexible. Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar  but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished.  I don't think the Bundesbank would give that up   one banking analyst said.  I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system   the analyst said  adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues  but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket  he said. For this reason  few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday. Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt  banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon."
"2","&lt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>(NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31  1988 from a projected 348 billion this year  the company said. Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5 506 billion yen from a projected 5 328 billion this year  NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1 770 billion yen in 1987/88  including 109 billion for research and development  as against a total of 1 600 billion this year. An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January  were the major factors behind the projected decrease in profits. The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in 1985."

"2","Thai Airways International plans toexpand its fleet to 58 from 30 aircraft by 1995  company officials said. Thamnoon Wanglee  vice-president for finance  told a weekend marketing conference Thai would finance the expansion by borrowing  but he did not give details. He said the airline planned to reduce its yen borrowing to 36.4 pct of overall debt by September 1992. It is currently 64.3 pct of overall debt. He said dollar borrowing should rise to 56.2 pct of overall debt in the same period  compared to 15.7 pct now. Other company officials said the state-owned airline had no plans to go private. They said the airline is studying a government proposal for it to merge with Thai Airways Company  the state-owned domestic carrier. A report presented to the conference showed the airline expects passenger sales revenue to be 13 pct higher in 1987 than in 1986. This follows a 20 pct jump in passenger sales revenue in the past four months. Executive vice president Chatrachai Bunya-ananta said the current expansion of Bangkok airport would be completed this year."

End-February reserves last year were 27.58 billion dlrs. In January  the nation's foreign reserves showed the largest-ever monthly increase at 9.22 billion dlrs due to massive Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention during the month as the dollar fell briefly to an all-time low of 149.98 yen on January 19  foreign exchange dealers said."

"2","Iraq has secured agreement to deferoutstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan following five months of negotiations with creditor banks. Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world oil prices. Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last September it could not meet the remaining four principal repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs  and missed the first of these for 71.25 mln due on September 29. The 500 mln dlr credit  under the lead management of Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF)  has a five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not deferred. One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of the accord  expected in late March  with the remainder in three more instalments to be made every six months. The remaining three principal instalments - originally due in March 1987  September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be deferred for two years from the due date  banking sources said. The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty interest is being imposed  the sources added. Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one of resignation  with many bankers seeing little alternative for Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs  although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies  particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit  a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank  was signed in October  1985 and is still in a two year grace period. The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing. But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit."

"2","Japanese securities houses will issue newcorporate bonds more quickly  accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1  to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market  securities managers said. Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash  but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues  they said.  Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds  but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds  to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets   a Nikko Securities house bond manager said. Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now  the securities managers said. Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system  in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end  and accept issue requests during the month  they said. Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market  securities managers said. Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April  with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>. The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms  securities sources said. The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds. Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic  they said. The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market  securities house managers said. The finance ministry  commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1  securities managers said. The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now  securities managers said. The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system  more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process  securities sources said. It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system  which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds  and for deregulation of private placements  they said. Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect  the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law  expected in 1988  the sources said."

"2","Japanese importers bought some 95 000tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment  under the semi-annual trade accords  trade sources said. The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne  up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment  but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment. Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium. Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans  including spot buying  may have totalled 240 000 to 250 000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment  down from some 300 000 tonnes the previous year  the sources said. Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240 000 to 250 000 tonnes a year  the sources said. In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers  but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing  they said."

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>  in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake  about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option  the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns  share analysts said  making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier  an arms and chemicals group  to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies  Atlas Copco &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>. Since then  the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg  a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon  also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company  the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>. During 1986  the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities."
"2","Soybean imports are forecast to rise to425 000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated 300 000 in 1986/87 and 375 000 in 1985/86  the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture. It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target. Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190 000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270 000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295 000 tonnes in 1985/86. Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980 000 in the current year and 890 000 in 1985/86  the report said. Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988. China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share  while the U.S. Provides the rest  it said.  This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them   it said. Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.  Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds  along with pest and disease problems   the report said."

"2","Japanese banks are expected to giveNigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks  banking sources said.  We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling   said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank. A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt  bankers said. The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans.  The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation   said another Japanese bank official. He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details. Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria  representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions  banking sources said. They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here  the sources added.  Otherwise  our response will be very negative   the senior official said. Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal. Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems. Barclays Bank plc &lt;BCS.L> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem  the banking sources said. BankAmerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far East and representing them on the committee  they added."

Among the main factors affecting liquidity  bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.61 billion stg. Partly offsetting this outflow  exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360 mln stg respectively. In addition  bankers' balances above target will add some 20 mln stg to the system today."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likelyto leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package  political analysts said. They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988.  Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration  which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican   Rei Shiratori  professor of politics at Dokkyo University  told Reuters.  Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax  probably in the summer   Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax  which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax.  There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies   he told a meeting of government and party leaders.  If the party discipline is broken  I would like to see punishment considered.   A proposed sales tax has become a political issue  partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it   Shiratori said.  Moreover  the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging   he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2 500 local elections scheduled for April  involving governors  mayors  town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated  since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP  the political analysts added. Shiratori said   In the worst case  implementation of the sales tax  now scheduled for next January  may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision.  Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct.  A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs   he said. Seizaburo Sato  professor of politics at Tokyo University  thought the last possibility most likely.  I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills   he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House. To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills  the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign  Sato said.  Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed   he said."
"2","Thousands of blackmineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa's gold  uranium  platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers. About 15 000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200 000 strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations. Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines. It was not stated how the union would  seize control.  The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex hostels for migrant workers  to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families. The crowd  one of the largest to attend a meeting since South Africa declared a state of emergency last June  also shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela be released."
"2","Thailand's Commerce Ministry announced anew tapioca export quota of 737 987 tonnes for the European Community against 762 860 tonnes for the previous allocation. The ministry said the fresh allocation  for the February 27-July 7 shipment period  is the third under a maximum 5.5 mln tonne overall quota that Thailand obtained from the EC for calendar 1987. It said the quota allocation was based on a national tapioca pellet stock of 4.34 mln tonnes surveyed last week  up from 3.05 mln in mid-January."
"2","Mine and industry officials frommost member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96 000 tonnes in the year started March 1  according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports  agreed in January  is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50 000 tonnes from 70 000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan  Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28 526 tonnes  Indonesia 24 516  Thailand 19 000  Bolivia 13 761  Zaire 1 736 and Nigeria 1 461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However  the tonnage allocated to it  7 000 tonnes  is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia  the world's leading producer  said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31 500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3 000 tonnes after exports of 28 500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24 516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24 636. In Bangkok  Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19 000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence  the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles  and income tax exemptions would be permitted  he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production  industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo  Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18 367 tonnes in 1986  up from 17 359 in 1985  Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13 761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9 000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20 000 of the 28 000 workers at the state mining company Comibol  which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines  Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1 461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1 000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106 000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21 000 and 7 000 tonnes respectively during the quota period."

"2","Disagreement over management of &lt;SanMiguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board  investment analysts said. They told Reuters the presence of &lt;United Coconut Planters Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean changes in SMC management  which for decades was controlled by the family of its president  Andres Soriano. Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of San Miguel's stock  after another nominee resigned. The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds six seats on the 15-member SMC board  which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by Eduardo Cojuangco  then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos  and he left the country after Marcos's fall. Before the seizure  Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares  paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit. The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded at 93 pesos today  down from 95.50 at Friday's close. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the objections of some directors associated with Soriano.  I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such   he said.  I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner   Ongpin added. The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. UCPB  however  sought board representation before Sy's appointment  petitioning the PCGG  so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected.  Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. The analysts said Sy  backed by the government  would probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual election is scheduled for May. A UCPB spokesman declined to comment  saying it was up to the PCGG to decide whom to appoint. One analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago.  It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano   he said. SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales of 10.36 billion."
"2","The combined profits of Japan's majorcorporations  excluding financial institutions  are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31  compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November  Wako Research Institute of Economics said. The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1 084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November. Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct  it said. Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook  the institute said. It said lower interest rates  which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs  are also behind the improved performance outlook. Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses  it said. The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88."

"2","Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty  economists  politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88  ending March  is 56.88 billion rupees  down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87  based on wholesale prices  is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday  Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure  he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani  president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party  said Gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy  as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply  may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects  after bad weather last year  may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88  up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes  which will discourage savings  economists said. Avinash Purulkar  chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India  said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said   There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure.  But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene.  Just now there is acute nervousness in the market   he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues  both convertible and non-convertible  rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85."

Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>  which currently holds a 50.1 pct  and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities  one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes  obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco  suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people  with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit  which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York  where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day  and in London where it has 15 billion.

"2","Hungary is to embark on a new series ofausterity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints. But Zoltan Boesze  chief of the Finance Ministry's budget financing division  told Reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided  quite severe  measures were needed.  All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures   he said. Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Boesze said:  The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results  and of course the Fund would support these efforts.  IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year. Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms  which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall  Boesze said. Subsidies to state firms  including grants to maintain low consumer prices  exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986  up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.  I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies   Boesze said.  The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful.  Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities.  I believe these reserves should not be used at all   he said. Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product  which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987  but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. This would mean a severe cut in living standards  as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1. About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies  but that social considerations made this difficult. But he added:  I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.  He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims. Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. Between 100 000 and 150 000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures. Istvan Nagy  a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law  told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. After subsidies to state enterprises  the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986  Boesze said. Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs  according to provisional figures  while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank  mostly from abroad  and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a  very difficult  situation  but not in crisis. There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year  however  and borrowing must be used more effectively.  Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous   Berecz said."

"2","Japanese consumers hesitated about buyingthe controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today  but said the DAT player's near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.  The sound is great  but I'll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100 000 yen before buying one   said Terumi Fujitsuka  35  a steel firm employee. Aiwa  Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks  retailers said. Aiwa's machine  the cheapest  is listed at 188 000 yen. Machines by Sony  Hitachi  Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March  industry sources said. DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines  they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the DAT player's debut  the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.  Nobody can tell the difference   one salesman said. DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese hardware makers  hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition  are eager to carve out a profitable niche. Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly  possibly to around 70 000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market  industry analysts said. They said by 1990  sales could reach six mln units per year. Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year."
"2","Italy's strong economic revival has ledsome observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects  but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.  I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism   says Luigi Spaventa  one of Italy's leading economists and a professor at Rome University. According to Spaventa  these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years  with Italy one minute seen as the  bad boy of Europe  and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration   I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room.  Spaventa  in tune with other economists and industrialists here  stress Italy's recent achievements  particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises  but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.  &lt;FIAT.M> and &lt;ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming  the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses  inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. Only this week  it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States  Japan  West Germany  France and Britain. Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy  economists and industrialists say.  We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy   warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti. He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism  the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. The country's huge state sector deficit  high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems  experts say. The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109 561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100 000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again  says Carlo Scognamiglio  head of the private Luiss university in Rome. Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running at 4.5 pct  but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness  economists and industrialists say. And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last October according to the latest official data. Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in October 1986  almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct  more than double that in the industrial north. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product (GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last year  when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3 717 billion lire  by year end from 23 085 billion lire in 1985. But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations  it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities  economists say. Italy has no controls on insider trading. The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures  economists say.  Even today  if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse  I doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that   says Spaventa."

"2","Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks  held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations  will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus  U.S. Officials said.  We appreciate their frustration   a senior Japanese government official said.  But we are also frustrated.  The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard  forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade  but it will  he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.  It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments   a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance  which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days  the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing  and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government  which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports  as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices.  It condemns Japan without due process   one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen  he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill  particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S.  Officials said. Nevertheless  Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position  especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.  We have no leverage   one official admitted. As a result  Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields  including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers  officials said."

The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings  and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years  Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870 000 pounds  up from 833 000 for the 300 series  and offers an eight pct fuel saving  he said.

"2","The European Community Commission saidit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices. The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint  Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers  forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses  it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs. The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority."
"2","The Philippines will offer commercialbank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash  the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said   It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.  Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country's 12-bank advisory committee  Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.  (The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative   Ongpin said.  Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund  the (World) Bank  the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received.   We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side   Ongpin said.  We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit. Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable  but Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt. He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to meet the targets  adding that the banks' attitude had improved following Brazil's decision.

"2","A rift has occured among Philippineofficials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement. Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs.  He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted   Monsod said. Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period. Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Monsod said    Right now we are saying to the banks  let's share the financing burden.  Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap. He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis. He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility. Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.  Secretary Monsod and I get along famously   he said.  She talks and I listen but I don't necessarily agree.  Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates  the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years.  If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?  she said  adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.  It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets   Monsod said.  Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day   she said. Monsod  the government's chief economic planner  stressed Manila's policy was growth before debt. She said if the banks refused to lend the new money  the Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing all debt repayments.  If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad  then of course you have an option   Monsod said.  You just don't send it abroad. You do a Brazil."

Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying that  none of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd). Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits."
"2","Taiwan plans another round of deep tariffcuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.  A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming  vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development  told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1 700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.  We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially   he said. The United States  Taiwan's main trading partner  has said the island's import tariffs  still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct  were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs  which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas  particularly for shoes  textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord  Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

"2","French state-owned chemicals groupRhone-Poulenc &lt;RHON.PA> said it will increase its capital with a 2.5 billion franc issue of preferential investment certificates on March 9. Company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said 500 mln francs of the issue will be placed in the U.S. Details of the issue will be announced by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur on March 6. The group  due to be privatised at an unspecified date  said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue its development strategy and make further acquisitions. Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the Paris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The group's capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs. Fourtou  speaking at a news conference  did not give details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987. He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial investment program of around five billion francs  and research spending of about 3.5 billion francs. Rhone-Poulenc spent 5.5 billion francs on acquisitions last year.  Chemistry is on the move and we face opportunities that must be seized   Fourtou said."
"2","Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year  chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year  equal to 26 cents per share  adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison  which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals  earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs  partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post  the leading English language newspaper  compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>  itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately  Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish  which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free  with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites. Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel  property development  and interests in Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO.TO> of Canada and Pearson Plc &lt;PSON.L> of Britain."
"2","The French inflation rate is expected toshow a substantial improvement in February after January's very high 0.9 pct monthly rate  Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said. He told a French television interviewer that half of the high January rise  which took year on year inflation that month to three pct  was due to higher oil prices.  Now  taking account of this inflation index  our forecast for price rises this year is two and a half pct   he said. Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target  which the government had initially set at two pct for this year  should not affect wage expectations for this year.  There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy   he said  referring to the government's aim of holding public sector wage increases to three pct this year. Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in 1985."
"2","The U.S. economy continued to expand inFebruary  but at a slower pace than in January which saw a spurt of activity  the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report. The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January  the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The report  based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies  also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. However  production remained vigorous as more than three times as many members reported it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month  but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X> gradually resumed production. An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth month  more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices  this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz  chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc &lt;PBI> said  the economy continued to expand in February  but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter.  The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure  based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders  production  vendor deliveries  inventories and employment."
"2","Brazil would not have suspendedpayments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.  It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't finance a little bit more quickly and easily   Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy. Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds  he replied   Yes  because our country did not receive financing from these agencies.  Asked how long the payment suspension would last  Funaro said  It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side.  Brazil  with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs  stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks. Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans. He said the net transfer was hurting the country's continued growth and capacity to import goods.  Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil   Funaro said. He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see  automatic  official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves  now reported to be below four billion dlrs. Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs. But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions  the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt.  We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment   Funaro said. He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years  leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available. Funaro said U.S officials understand his position  but they don't like it.  Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain  West Germany  France  Switzerland and Italy. Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines."

"2","American Express Co  rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc  said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement  American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week  rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson  but the plan was considered highly unlikely  analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday  as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage  which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however  the need for added capital is puzzling.  (American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to   said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added  previously vacant  post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions  a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts  contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm  however  that the financial services firm  which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year  is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year  Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton  and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage."

"2","Switzerland recorded last year its firstoverall surplus in government finances since 1974  ending with a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs  the Finance Ministry said. The surplus  including cash transactions and long-term investments  contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. All categories of revenues were higher than forecast  and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. Tax receipts  at 25.11 billion  were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast  378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more  the ministry said. The ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. But economic factors  including the low rate of inflation  the weak dollar  falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt  which accounted for the difference between the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln franc overall surplus."

"2","Apple Computer Inc today willannounce the addition of two new machines to its profitable Macintosh line of personal computers  both aimed at the business market. The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new machines  the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II  will be faster and more versatile  but considerably more expensive than earlier models. The Mac SE (SE stands for  system expansion )  which Apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus  goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2 899 to 3 699 dlrs depending on its features. The Mac II  designed to run about four times faster than the Mac Plus  is to be ready for shipping in May and priced between 4 798 and 6 998 dlrs. Mac Plus  which went on the market one year ago  sells for about 2 200 dlrs. Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld Conference in Los Angeles. Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on Friday  especially the high-performance Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations. John Sculley  Apple chairman and chief executive officer  declined to estimate anticipated sales  but he said the Mac SE should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.  I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for most people   he said.  My sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue.  Bruce Lupatkin  senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco  said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well.  Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation   he told Reuters.  The graphics interface on the Mac products is significantly better than anything IBM has to date.  International Business Machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring. The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor  an  open architecture  that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices  a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory  expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor. In a demonstration of its speed and power  company executives said they thought the Mac II would push the development of software for Apple computers in new directions that could include sophisticated video editing  electronic mail systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use. The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray. The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte RAM  expandable to four megabytes  and a nine-inch monochrome screen. Both new computers have two optional keyboards  a new feature in the Apple line of products."

"2","LL and E Royalty Trust said LouisianaLand and Exploration Co &lt;LLX>  the working interest owner for its oil and natural gas properties  is entitled to start placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue to the trust. LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the necessity of doing so.  The trust said  If the working interest owner does begin to escrow funds  the effect on the royalties paid to the trust would be significant.   Royalties from the properties are the trust's only source of income. The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices. It said  however  that oil and natural gas reserves have actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates reflect prices and costs only through September 30. The trust said using the September figures  the engineers determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices received in January 1987  however  it said the estimate would have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has been some weakening in prices since January. The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama and Florida  a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986  as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production costs after expenses of nitrogen injection."

"2","New Jersey-based overnight messengerPurolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid  but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO  a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc  will be majority owner of the company. Hutton said the acquiring company  PC Acquisition Inc  is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition  containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered  shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash  six dlrs in debentures  and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s  at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs  and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division  which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called  bridge  financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans  Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business  its president Warren Idsal said.  Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations  which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future   said Idsal. William Taggart  chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division  will be chief executive officer of the new company. The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions. The offer will begin Thursday  subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended."

The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman  Sachs and Co ran the books on that deal  with First Boston acting as co-manager. However  Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called  cars deals  that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.  The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast  the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle   he said. In a grantor trust  investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust  analysts explained. The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A  which the bank established for that single purpose  investment bankers pointed out. The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct  or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life  the deal was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively.  AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal   one said. However  Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies  unlike many of last year's cars deals  which were rated by S and P alone.  Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months   Dub detailed. Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half  the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables  backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables  making it one of the biggest in the U.S.  analysts said. Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into the young asset-backed securities market  analysts noted. In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold  via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A  514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc. Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp  a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc  via First Boston  and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp  a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>  via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc. The asset backed market  which began in March 1985  totals an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs."

"2","After a week that left his presidencyshaken and his popularity at a new low  Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal. Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker  whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise  will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon. Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates  a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat  would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote  Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said. Appearing on the NBC News program   Meet the Press   the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination  could be in some difficulty.  Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority by Baker. Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal  lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and  even if won  would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair.  He has the smell of Iran on him   said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt.  He is a victim.  Laxalt  appearing on the ABC News program   This Week With David Brinkley   bluntly admitted  the Gates nomination is in trouble.  Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates. When asked on the syndicated television program   John McLaughlin: One on One   if he thought Gates would be confirmed  the Georgia Democrat shot back:  I wouldn't bet any money on it.  I think this report hurts that   Nunn said.  It indicates that the National Security Council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with Mr. Gates. Only a day after it was issued last week  the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff. Regan  the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years  was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale. The report blamed Regan for the  chaos that descended on the White House  since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two  pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal  have refused to testify. Reagan  who freely admits disliking details  is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership  a record low  and a third believed he should consider resignation. After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower  Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency."

The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986  adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K.

It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies.

"2","Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks  he said  adding  This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.  The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983  however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S.  Japanese and European banks  Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis   Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors   central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks  followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions  worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain  France  West Germany  Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans  giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus  its chief means of servicing its foreign debt  started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt.  What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service  because we cannot service all that   he said.  I really think we have to change the old rules.  Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments  rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis  Funaro said  We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks  because the banks have some limits.   It is a political discussion from our point of view   he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks  If I've got some solution from the governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks.  He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982.  You must open these mechanisms   he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments  they understood Brazil had no other choice  as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed  because we can't stay as we were the last few years.   I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.  he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy  Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year  against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world  Funaro said  although its share of international trade was only one pct.   The solution is linked with growth  not recession   he said  noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments  as opposed to commercial banks  now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt."

"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves  a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support. Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. Funaro  accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros  is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy  arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium  because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view.  Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis  describing the meeting as an initial contact. He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request. After travelling this week to France  Germany  Switzerland and Italy  Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks."

"2","Investor Sumner Redstone  who leadsone of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc  offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  Redstone  who controls Dedham  Mass. -based National Amusements Inc  a theater chain operator  offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. The Redstone offer  which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc  a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose  which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover. Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc  a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom. The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers  but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. The Redstone group  which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom  and the management group  which has a 5.4 pct stake  have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed  unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements  which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. In his SEC filing  Redstone  who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs  said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate  Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs  Redstone said. Merrill Lynch  Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover  from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier  Redstone said. Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6 881 800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash  he said. The new offer  the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management  also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents  he said. Last week  the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company  valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash  preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs."

"2","European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market  which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of  manifest crisis.  But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries  with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead  in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures  they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a  voluntary  basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area  that of hot rolled coils  and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program  particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240 000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes."

"2","Directors of the Chicago MercantileExchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index futures pit  an exchange executive said. The petition calls for elimination of dual trading  a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account. But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called  front-running   where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers. Leo Melamed  CME special counsel  said directors will rule on the petition on Wednesday  but added that a special S and P Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days. In addition to a recommendation on dual trading  Melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit. Melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because  most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations.  CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board accepts the member's petition this week  a rule change will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval. If the board does nothing  or rejects the petition request  a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days  Beyer said. Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made  it will confuse the issue.  Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading. Although Jonathan Wolff  senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette  noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges.  It's a question of the integrity of the person you do business with   Wolff said. Futures traders who act as brokers  however  maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits.  To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors   said John Michael  vice president at First Options of Chicago.  What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved   he said. Furthermore  the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood  he said.  If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running)  or even suspected him of doing it  I would cut him off   Michael said. An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit  for instance  will fill orders for 5 000 to 10 000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract  floor sources said.  Even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative. Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move  but also the risk of losing the brokerage business  Michael said."

"2","The staff of the federal Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on 2.25 billion dlrs of bonds  a WPPSS official told Reuters. WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was selling the bonds. English  in a telephone interview  said the SEC staff planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants  which were to built with the bonds' proceeds. English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made no public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.  We at all times told the public everything we knew about the costs   he said. English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC might meet on the staff's recommendations. The SEC  as a matter of policy  never comments on its enforcement activities. The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and the agency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized on several occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell  the Michigan Democrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC's budget and operations. Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS  one has been completed  two remain under construction  and two others--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- have been terminated."

"2","A bidding war for Viacom InternationalInc  one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies  pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc  a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal  a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week.  It would take 20 days from the day we mail   said the source. The source predicted National Amusements  controlled by investor Sumner Redstone  would need  half a year  to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan  he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation.  We think we're at the end now  in terms of bidding   said the firm's arbitrageur  who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock  convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash  a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs  and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings  representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash  exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group  led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes  were offering high prices.  Redstone really wants to own the company   one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>  which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year  inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share  dipped to nine dlrs  and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week  Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>  which owns a stake in Warner  rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4. Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>. The company has 940 000 cable television subscribers  operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films and other programs for television."

The council said  in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement  fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.  But at the same time  it added  Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks  Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking  insurance  telecommunications  and the so-called  cultural industries  - publishing  broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation   acid rain  and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage."

We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base   Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company  ICI Pharma  which  with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit  it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said   Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not.  ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs  which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990  ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.  The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return   said A.W. Clements  finance director of ICI  who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline  expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually  were Statil  a treatment for diabetic complications  Zoladex  a treatment for advanced prostate cancer  and Carwin  a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex  both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>  is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs  but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints  which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions  the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as  too expensive.  Henderson said that in his new role of chairman  effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire  the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses."

"2","Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaroflatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters  Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris  he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago  put Brazil in a very big recession.   We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF   he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks  the statement  which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands  said.  That was not my impression of the meeting   Funaro said;  But if the (British) answer is more or less like this  then that means nothing is helping to find a solution.  Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies  rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.  Since 1982  all official agencies have been closed to my country   he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington  Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved  Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.  We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme   he said   We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens.  Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies  which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year.  Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort   he said.  What we have to offer is our cooperation."

"2","All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed  two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions   but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions  on world grain trade  the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers  NAWG  and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities  a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved  and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be  the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals  which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and  quarantine  U.S. wheat stocks  would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers  they said. Other countries  including Australia  have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs  the organizations said.  We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers   Jim Miller  president of NAWG said.  We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture   Miller said."

"2","Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said hehas had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened  1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders  including the biggest investor  the Bass family of Texas. However  the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer  he said. Pesch  in an interview with Reuters  said based on the conversations he held with shareholders  he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said  however  there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc  the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today  Wedge Group  which has a 5.5 pct stake  said it held discussions with Pesch  American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge  in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be  highly desirable and appropriate at this time.   That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share   said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort  in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash  four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical  but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg  an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical  and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch  who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year  continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt  and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm  another cause for concern to Wall Street. However  Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson  Lufkin  and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.  I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed  provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment   Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts  compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer.  I think it's much more doable   he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs."

Warner  the owner of Home State  was found guilty of six counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home State money without authorization from the board of directors -- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985 collapse. He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful misapplication. Burton Bongard  former Home State president  was convicted of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel  also a former president  was convicted on three of four counts of securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan companies in Ohio  which was lifted on an individual basis as the firms were able to show proof of their solvency. Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a 1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25 000 dlr bond for Schiebel pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30. Lawrence Kane  special prosecutor  said that Warner and Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his convictions.

U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks  he said  adding  This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.  The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983  however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S.  Japanese and European banks  Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis   Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors   central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks  followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions  worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain  France  West Germany  Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans  giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.

Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs  this floating-rate class contains a so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture possible lost interest  according to Kidder Peabody. For instance  if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the 11 pct cap  investors would be paid back  dollar for dollar  the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did not carry a maximum interest rate  a Kidder officer said.

The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60 basis points over three-month LIBOR  with a 13 pct cap. This tranche does not have a catch-up provision  the Kidder officer said. The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 10.903 pct.

"2","U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats  another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture. In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors  Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers  who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.  This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market   Yeutter said. Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT. He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans  making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine  and closer in price to expensive European butter.  I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal   Yeutter said.  It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks)   he said."

A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week. Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens. The Greek statement today said   Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government.   The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey   it said.

"2","French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year  the same rate as last year  unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988  from its present 10.9 pct  it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was  increasingly ill-adapted to demand  selling goods at  uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.   France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months   it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986  it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to  a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.  This could result in further major losses of market share  particularly in the non-OECD area  which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports  it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved  the authorities would have  little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre  even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly   it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands  contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next  the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year  the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987  and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices  caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.  We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises  and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost   one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report  indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct  against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year  with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area  the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival  West Germany  could fall to just one pct this year  it said. On the other hand  the report noted  consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.  For the disinflationary process to continue   and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability  it is essential that wage restraint continue   it said."

"2","The federal Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp  attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said. During the takeeover attempt  a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc  a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition  a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies  and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally  Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE  according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys  who asked not to be identified  said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation  as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE  since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America  had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe. The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers. A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe. The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time.  To the best of our knowledge  Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation  in connection with the TRE bid  he said. A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:  We had nothing to do with TRE.  As a matter of policy  the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities."
"2","Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker  a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal  will serve a third term  sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment  which must be filled this August  has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan  who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement  was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker  first appointed in 1979 by President Carter  will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration  Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker  kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay  the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story  quickly shot down by others in the administration  that Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the council of economic advisers  had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire  it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican  Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.  This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get   said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question  Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership  foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry  but recent statements by Volcker  in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation  signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw  exactly eye-to-eye  on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985  he decided to ensure a good working relationship  in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan  Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term  was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker  whose political skills undermined that ambition  and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay.  Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise   said one.  He'd have to be asked   said Stephen Axilrod  formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise  the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut  he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous  coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor  therefore  would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz  whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal  while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan  frequently an informal presidential economic adviser  New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman  and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege  Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House."

"2","Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union  while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports.

An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation  which he said was started by  somebody fanning the (wheat) market.  Wheat futures strengthened today  partly on the basis of the speculation. One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat  much of it before mid-year  if it was  competitively priced.  Alexander Ivlev  an official with Amtorg  a Soviet trading organization  told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer  but said that Moscow  would consider  buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced.  We don't care if it is EEP  what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices   Ivlev said.

"2","Contracting for future constructionwork declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of 236.1 billion dlrs  a report on the industry said. The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding construction was largely responsible for the month's setback from December's higher level. Residential building eased three pct in January  while contracts for commercial  industrial and institutional buildings rebounded slightly  according to the report. Nonbuilding construction  which soared to an annualized rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only major electric power plant was started  fell back 10 pct to 43.1 billion. Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction advanced five pct in January. However  available funding for 1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending authority. Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional structures  such as schools and health facilities  was the reason for the gain  the report said. Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in January  a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally adjusted rate  the report stated.

"2","European Community (EC) farm ministerswere fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. Meanwhile  protests from angry European farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food production appeared to be gathering strength. In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from Brussels. The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of Malaga  citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at EC duties. Towards the end of last week  about 10 000 angry West German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed EC prices. In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review  at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies  Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas. Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. That decision  agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations  was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive  but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores  but the Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package. Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem  and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this year of some 5.7 billion dlrs."

"2","Japan's seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January  the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953  up from the previous record 2.9 pct in December  the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people  up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier. Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct  equal to the second-worst level set last December. Record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986. Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct  equal to the record level marked in April  August  September and December last year. January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries  particularly in export-related firms  due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar  officials said. Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380 000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry  down 190 000 from a year earlier  and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders  down 170 000."

Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150  at least for the rest of the year   he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.

"2","Opec remains within its agreed outputceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day  and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock  he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now  he replied:  Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).  He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market  but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price.  We hope the weak price will be overcome  and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.  Refiners  he said  appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together."
"2","The government's industry aid andprotection review body  the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC)  will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry  Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said. The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature  duration and extent of any aid  he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30  1989  when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.  The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes   he said.  The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry  as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time   he said. Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season. The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage  Handling and Transport  Kerin said. He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry."
"2","The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today  coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now  they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set  delegates said. Quotas  the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement  were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight  heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue  the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring  coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil  the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively  each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum  U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks  said in a statement after the council adjourned   A majority of producers  led by Brazil  were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.  We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market  instead of their political influence in the ICO.  Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered   Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas  not negotiate them.  Previously  quotas were determined by historical amounts exported  which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks  which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia  the second largest exporter  to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems  illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt  have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings  particularly some African nations and Colombia  are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas  analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year  producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31  but the full council is not due to meet again until September  delegates said."

"2","Earthquakes and aftershocks are stillshaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3 000 people homeless. Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT). No casualties have been reported and no further major damage  civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km  the seismologist added. A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force  with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe  Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted. Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale. The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks  declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared  with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired. Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference of foreign ministers. A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when the buildings are declared safe."

"2","Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices  and on calculations gilt prices will firm  bond managers said. Japanese  British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains  including city and trust banks  which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market  they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger  the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand  major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year  traders said. These investors  who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases  appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo  a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today  up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However  gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates  they said.  The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds  suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here   said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki.

"2","Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record  senior economists  including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan  said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.  There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment   said Takashi Kiuchi  senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government  which published the January unemployment figures today  did not make any predictions.  At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year  but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving   a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries  such as cars and textiles  have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring  economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down  said Koichi Tsukihara  Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However  other economists disagreed  saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations  methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare  economists warned.  The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used   one economist said. More than half of January's 170 000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24  Sumitomo's Tsukihara said."

"2","Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea  Hong Kong and Singapore  a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period  it said. Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end. Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year. The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985  official figures show. Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986  the same figures show. Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner  after electrical and electronic products. Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs."

The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress. Wallis  who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting  made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito. Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one  rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country. He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three  the spokesman said. Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy."
"2","The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade  but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate  but those without it will not automatically be denied licences  he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers  who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said   If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company  it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure.  MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987  spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move.  As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices  there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money   a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said."

"2","Thailand's improving economy will likelycause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February  private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat  chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank Ltd>  said Thailand's strong export performance  its relatively high interest rates  foreign participation in its stock market  and growing foreign investment  especially from Japan  contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year  bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987  up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached. Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold  special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports."

"2","Singapore's Finance Minister RichardHu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1  bankers and economists told Reuters. They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986  indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985  the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct  and income tax was reduced by the same margin. Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme  the Central Provident Fund (CPF)  to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.  I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving   said Clemente Escano  vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The government's economic report for calendar 1986  issued last week  said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce  financial  and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. The sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87  but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure  helped by the wage-freeze policy. Anthony K.P. Lee  vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express Bank Ltd  said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. Lee said   It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support.  Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction  so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget  economists said. The economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further decline is expected in 1987. But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988  so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth  including incentives to families who have three children. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families  instead of the two-child families it encourages now."

"2","Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said stronginternational growth had been the main feature of the group's 1986 progress  with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50 pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period. The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme  a larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of its Intal anti-asthma drug  which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct. The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985. The result was in line with market forecasts  but its shares nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from 643p. Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral  as well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products  was clearly indicated by a strong 1986 performance. The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full programme of capital investment. Action to protect the group against foreign currency movements resulted in a small net gain to profits."
"2","The Philippines must devalue the peso ifit wants its exports to remain competitive  Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.  The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive   Monsod said an interview.  No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan  South Korea  West Germany  Japan  all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.  The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance.  If the dollar rate goes higher  our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher  so the financing is very difficult   she said.  But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.  She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.  I'm just saying  keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.  Monsod said   The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing.  Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984."

Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1 900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987  and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1 200 tonnes. The ATPC hopes to cut the 70 000-tonne world surplus by 20 000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan.

"2","The Federation of Bankers' Associations ofJapan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo. The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available  the proposal said. It should provide currency and interest rate futures  and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. To make this possible  the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit  three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets. Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles  the sources said. Japan's only current financial futures market  in yen bonds  began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985. But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April."

"2","Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks toconduct securities business here  a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down  financial analysts said. But the timing of the approval remains uncertain  due to conflicting domestic interests. J.P.Morgan and Co &lt;JPM>  Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT>  Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp &lt;CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan  U.S. Bank officials said.  There is no reason for extended delay of approval   one official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months. To date  Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries  this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market. But if U.S. Banks win approval  Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status  since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the U.S. Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment. U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months. Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June. At the last round of financial negotiations in September  U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging. Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers  including two Japanese brokerages  last December. They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S. Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the U.S. Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984  but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses. Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests  but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields. Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan. The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market."

"2","Early dollar straight eurobond trade wasquiet with currency sectors  particularly eurosterling  continuing to perform strongly  closely reflecting current trading patterns on the foreign exchanges  dealers said. Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily  bolstered by the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals. The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January. The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be weak  placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading impetus  one dollar straight trader said.  It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how anybody is going to make any money   he said. Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of the domestic equity markets. Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point. However  some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels. Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany. There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week. FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian -- banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.  (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis after things had more or less quietened down following the first shock statements last week   one FRN specialist said. Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight secondary market  two new dollar issues were the only early features on the primary market. These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4 pct. The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 -- for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct  with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager. Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due mainly to a lack of fresh  good name paper in the market."

No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project  due for completion in 1988  is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market  mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast  and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz  additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline  an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz  Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project  he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product  he added."

"2","Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its returnto profit reflected reduced costs  improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final  dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity  though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>  permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs  it said.

"2","CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected topay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1  making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985  against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1  dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id. The company operates on a substituted tax year  not the fiscal year ending June 30  and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings  CRA said in a statement. Consequently  it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout  it said. Despite the higher net earnings  CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry  with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years  it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty  while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry  CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined  with supply and demand in better balance  but overcapacity continues  CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings  CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985  it said. Lead  zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985  CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln  while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions  CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level  being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow  coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances  enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax  included in the net interest cost."

"2","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that  since bilateral trade began in 1972  China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all  mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that  if China wants to obtain GSP status  it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  for which it applied in July 1986  and  not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.  The official said China was well aware of the laws  some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's  but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years  which the U.S. Side won  he said. But  for the first time  China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods  which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case  he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.  China has the potential to disrupt world markets  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT   the diplomat said. Poland  Czechoslovakia  Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT.  The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type   Shultz said.  China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation   he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs  especially for exports  and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month  China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with  guidance planning  and economic levers. The diplomat said that  to join GATT  China had much to do."
"2","The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday  as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks  money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact  from which funds will be credited on Thursday  when an earlier pact expires  draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday  because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday  and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic  making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week  and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.  I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little  to say 14 or 15 billion marks   one dealer said.  They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer   he added. An earlier pact expires next week  draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank  averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month  just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

Pertamina has initialled a 20-year contract with Chinese Petroleum Corp &lt;CPC> for the supply of 1.5 mln tonnes of LNG for Taiwan starting October 1989  a CPC official said. CPC is building an LNG receiving terminal in southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung at a cost of 820 mln U.S. Dlrs. The terminal will be completed in mid-1989. A Taiwanese banker said It will be a good idea for our banks to take part in the loan if we want to start in the international lending market."

"2","Britain's gold and currency reservesshowed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February  after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January  the Treasury said. The underlying trend  which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges  is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs  after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month  after 163 mln in January  while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln  a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January  capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs  with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations  but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman  commenting on the reserves figures  said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels. He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting."
"2","Comalco Ltd said its return to profitreflected reduced costs  improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend  delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity  though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington  and port facilities at Portland  Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed."

"2","The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday  as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks  money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact  from which funds will be credited on Thursday  when an earlier pact expires  draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday  because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday  and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic  making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week  and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.  I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little  to say 14 or 15 billion marks   one dealer said.  They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer   he added. An earlier pact expires next week  draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank  averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month  just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

"2","West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems  senior West German banking sources said. The sources  speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg  also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  who met Funaro yesterday. Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt  which totals some 109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening. Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund. However  the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a  rapprochement  with the IMF.  Consultations are the least that can be expected   said one banker. Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982. Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks  holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt  were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks  involving separate discussions with the regions. Such a move would be in Brazil's interest  since European banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions  such as interest capitalisation. The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach  saying:  There must be one committee and one solution.  But he added:  There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account.  German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered.  The menu must become richer   the banker said. Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States  because of their lower exposure. According to Bundesbank data from September last year  West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit."
"2","President Corazon Aquino announcedgovernment plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24 billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the sale of failed businesses taken over by the government. Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugar estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.  Whatever laws will be enacted  I say that nobody is above the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are enacted as far as sugar land is concerned   she told reporters. A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan  including the question of whether land operated by multinational companies should also be covered  she added. Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform programme. The plan  requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs  now also covers sugar and coconut areas  apart from rice and corn lands  he said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless peasants  he added. Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break up her family's 6 000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of the most pressing problems facing the Philippines. It was not known whether government would wait for the Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or have Aquino carry it out through an executive order. Under the plan  government will purchase land mainly from landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50 000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos."
"2","Opec remains within its agreed outputceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day  and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock  he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now  he replied:  Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).  He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market  but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price.  We hope the weak price will be overcome  and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.  Refiners  he said  appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together."

"2","Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record  senior economists  including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan  said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.  There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment   said Takashi Kiuchi  senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government  which published the January unemployment figures today  did not make any predictions.  At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year  but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving   a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries  such as cars and textiles  have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring  economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down  said Koichi Tsukihara  Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However  other economists disagreed  saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years."

"2","Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices  and on calculations gilt prices will firm  bond managers said. Japanese  British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains  including city and trust banks  which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market  they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger  the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand  major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year  traders said. These investors  who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases  appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo  a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today  up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However  gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates  they said.  The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds  suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here   said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct  against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London."
"2","Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its carproduction could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary. A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's Unterturkheim plant  which makes axles and other components for Daimler cars  has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers. The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur. A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F]  which is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg  said he did not think Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on overtime by its own works councils. A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours. The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was currently around 2 500 a day."
"2","The price of Hongkong and ShanghaiHotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group  stock brokers said. They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau  Evergo's executive director  declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo  was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.  Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel  one of Asia's best known hotels  and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.  It is purely coincidence   he said. But analysts were not so certain  saying that the Evergo group  which has a reputation as a corporate raider  may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family  which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles.  Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family   said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share  though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun  Evergo  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday  China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs."

But they said that no decision on the appointment  which must be filled this August  has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan  who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement  was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker  first appointed in 1979 by President Carter  will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration  Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker  kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay  the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story  quickly shot down by others in the administration  that Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the council of economic advisers  had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire  it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican  Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.  This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get   said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question  Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership  foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry  but recent statements by Volcker  in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation  signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw  exactly eye-to-eye  on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985  he decided to ensure a good working relationship  in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan  Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term  was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker  whose political skills undermined that ambition  and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay.  Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise   said one.  He'd have to be asked   said Stephen Axilrod  formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise  the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut  he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous  coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor  therefore  would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz  whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal  while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan  frequently an informal presidential economic adviser  New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman  and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege  Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House."
"2","General Motors Corp has changed itsmethod of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year  a company spokesman said. He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum payments.  As a result  the merit raises will not be included in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change affects about 109 000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada.  GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for salaried workers  making pay increases based on merit alone. As a result of the new action  GM has effectively frozen the base pay rates of salaried employees. The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain cost-competitive with other U.S. automakers. GM is currently in thje midst of a program to cut employment of salaried workers by 25 pct."

"2","Employers and the port union  FNV  areto meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector  but neither side is optimistic  spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks  with both sides largely reiterating their positions.  There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV  and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking   a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman  Jacques Schoufour  accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.  The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all.   If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector  then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month   Schoufour said. The series of strikes  which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks  began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4 000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases  but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest."

Earlier  Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg  level with the year earlier period  making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year. Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1  1987.

"2","The U.S. index of leading indicatorsfell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain  the Commerce Department said. The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December. The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July  1984  when the index fell 1.7 pct. The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100  and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment. A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline. Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment  they were building permits  manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods  a change in sensitive materials prices  slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance. Four of 10 indicators were positive  including stock prices  new business formation  average work week and money supply. The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation. There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November. The index of coincident indicators  which measures the current economy  fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.

"2","This morning's sharp decline in coffeeprices  following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization  ICO  quotas  will be short-lived  Dutch roasters said.  The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas  but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again   a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.  The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present  there is a shortage of quality   he said.  Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks   the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction  it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.  There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement   he said.  There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation   de Vries added. With this in mind  and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover  the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb  roasters said."

"2","Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reportedimprovements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices  disposals and currency movements  Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy  aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses  had now been completed  he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on  with strategic acquisitions taking place  from time to time   he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms  however  profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However  it would not add much to profits  with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year  this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend  with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p  approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However  he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation  beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co  which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S.  Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business  considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However  he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss  with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents."

"2","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation."

"2","The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year  and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit  President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament  Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct  compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985  he added.  But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result  we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year   he said. The price of coffee  Kenya's main source of foreign exchange  fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil  which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel  has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes  coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world  made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history  he added.  This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts  and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development   he said.  It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs   the president added."

The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme  The New Vision of Kodak.  Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company  Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986.  If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent  that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500   it pointed out. The objective of Kodak's  new vision  communications campaign  it added  is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector. Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today -- -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes). - The Kodak KIMS system 5000  a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both. -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000  an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems. -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500  a microfilm-based  computer-assisted system which can be a starter system. Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988. Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150  14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus  Kodak pointed out  150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity. Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies  including erasable optical disks  high-density magnetic media  fiber optics and even artificial intelligence  is expected to sell in the 700 000 dlr range. Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks  each storing 2.6 gigabytes. Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives  it will sell for about 150 000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year. The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000. It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150 000 dlr range."

The second stage  Bangor Hydro said  effective when the MPUC makes a final decision  calls for an additional revenue reduction of 712 000 dlrs  or 1.1 pct.

The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.

"2","Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd 90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co &lt;F>  said the earlier reported decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover costs at its Essex  Ontario engine plant. Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs  partially offset by lower engine production. The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0  while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year.

The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies  cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery  which were partially offset by lower industry volumes.

Despite increased competition  Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985  it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct. Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck  both manufactured in Oakville  which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986."

A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986. The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants. Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months. Those discussions are continuing  the company said  adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants  it added. Last October  Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines  Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as  distressed  under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers. Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages  benefits and work rules. Union procedures  however  require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee  membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board. The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants."

"2","Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pctof the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt  President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders. Speaking last night at a new session of congress  he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image.  Our priority is development  but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations   he said. Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.  The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year   Lusinchi said. He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had  decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case  because of the vulnerability of its economy.  Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February  1986  but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income  which dropped 40 pct last year. Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter  but that in any case it would become effective from April 1. Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement  and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support. Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation. He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela  a fundamental achievement in the new accord.  Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing   he said  adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise."
