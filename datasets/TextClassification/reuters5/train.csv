"1","Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reportedimprovements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices  disposals and currency movements  Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy  aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses  had now been completed  he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on  with strategic acquisitions taking place  from time to time   he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms  however  profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However  it would not add much to profits  with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year  this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend  with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p  approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However  he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation  beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co  which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S.  Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business  considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However  he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss  with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents."
"1","Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecastearnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities. Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986  it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements. Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets. The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations  mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc."

"2","The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board  AWB  about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop  the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains  the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price  it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price  GMP  calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years  the department said. In addition  deductions for taxes  freight  handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics  BAE  predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports  the department said."

The Treasury said in a statement the annual yield of the seven-year certificates will be indexed to 50 pct of the annual yield of 12-month treasury bills. Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue will be 9.66 pct.  The launch of the new certificate has to be viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate issues   the Treasury said. The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and variable-rate investments."
"2","Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowingto 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986  and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments  the Governor of the Bank of Greece  Dimitris Halikias  said. He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs  but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost. Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986  up from 15.2 billion at end-1985  Halikias said. He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures. He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October  1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985. Halikias said he was  fairly optimistic  Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year. He said domestic demand has fallen  reducing the need for imports  while Greek exports are becoming more competitive. Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period  while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion."
"2","The Bundesbank is planning changes inthe system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument  central bank officials said. Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently  enabling the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses  to steer money market liquidity more flexibly. The changes will probably come into force in April. Under the current system  banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank for subsequent repurchase  a time consuming business. Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks  which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level. Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the Hesse LZB  which covers the Frankfurt area. The change to come into force next month will allow the Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself  in a process legally comparable to direct debiting. At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on Monday  holds the tender late on Tuesday morning  announces the result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday. The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28 days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary. For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow (Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt yesterday (Tuesday). Central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical  with no direct implications for interest rates.  It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter   said an official at the Hesse LZB. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago  and praised their flexibility. The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible  banking economists said. By speeding up the tender process  they will make it possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month  something long sought by banks  to respond to changing money market conditions.  With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be refined  but there won't be any effect on interest rates   said Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger. The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments  but by steering liquidity  not interest rates  he said."

"2","The Canadian Wheat Board has advisedthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat  oats  and barley in the crop year beginning August 1  a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers.  They're all lower   he said.  This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.  Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board  which markets most of Canada's grain  obtains higher than expected prices on world markets  the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower  the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices  usually made in April  rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts. But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year."

"2","Trading in energy futures on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next five to 10 years as the market matures  according to outgoing chairman Michel Marks.  Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous period of transition that will last five to 10 years   Marks said  adding that volume will soar  international participation will increase  and activity of producing countries  major oil companies  and speculators will grow. Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.  The priority of the next 10 years is operational efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product development   said Marks. Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX  which is running out of trading space  to process greater volumes expeditiously in order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that are already planned. Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by the end of the decade to 250 000 contracts daily and combined products volume could soar to  100 000 contracts a day. Much of the increased activity will come from the international sector  according to Marks.  That's a huge growth area   he said  adding that it will run the gamut from foreign producer countries to foreign independent operators. He said it would be difficult to develop a futures contract based on an internationally traded crude although he previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.  Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task  he said. Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on an international product rather than an international crude will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.

The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to be announced later  he said. Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of Ceylon  the nation's central bank  until January. A Swiss-based non-governmental group  which Sandaratne declined to identify  has agreed in principal to guarantee export credits  he said  but refused to elaborate further. The bank may also consider more actively participating in the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees  or about 70 pct of the total market  he said. Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in its wholly-owned subsidiary  Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd.

"2","The U.S. economy is facing severalserious problems which threaten its continued expansion  according to a Congressional report released today. The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near future. Committee Republicans released a separate  more optimistic report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation. Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee  which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.  The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger signals that lie just below the surface   Committee chairman Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.  A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current recovery  while long  is fragile  and we are skating on thin ice   the Maryland Democrat said. He said the danger signals included a decline in investment  increased demand for borrowing which was straining the financial system  a possible increase in inflation fueled by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the nation's farmers. Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around three pct for this year and next  similar to Administration forecasts.  The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're comfortable with the current low rate of inflation  hopeful that interest rates will continue to decline  optimistic that employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident in this nation's resilient  innovative and diversified economy   the Republican report said.  The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress is reducing the federal deficit   the Republicans added. Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but also wanted the government to spend more on education  job training  research and development and health care. They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy if this becomes necessary.  There is now substantial concern about the inflationary effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money supply   the Democrat report said.  At the same time  the increased reliance on foreign sources of capital in American investment markets means that the Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down.   Taken together  the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy is thus not very encouraging   the Democrats said. The Democrats called on the Administration to be more aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking new initiatives to solve the international debt problem. The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been caused by misalignment of the world's currencies  especially the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982. Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to increase American productivity including incentives for saving and investment in plant and equipment and development of a better educated work force."

Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices  Wilson said it has to be recognized the area was a  prisoner of market forces outside the boundaries of this country.  Wilson  appearing before the committee to discuss the government's spending estimates released earlier this week  said the government is doing what it can in the region  citing more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.  Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on our part in dealing with a very difficult problem   Wilson said in response to questions about management of the economy from opposition party members. He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States  which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada."

"2","Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuringother members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas  said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer  speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference  also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.  Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down   Wellemeyer said.  The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again   he said. In recent weeks  oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota  pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today  with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices  Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day  or 18 pct of the world demand for oil."
"2","European Community Farm CommissionerFrans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.  We are now in a favourable position to improve the situation in the dairy sector   he told a news conference. The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of butter in EC stores  as the deal should prevent major new stocks from accruing. A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in December  but approval was held up by a row over Commission proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus stocks into store. After 36 hours of negotiations  ministers agreed detailed rules for such a suspension  allowing it only when new public stocks of butter exceed 180 000 tonnes and when market prices were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores. Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for cuts in EC farm price cuts  notably in cereals  in the coming season. The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay compensation to those who opt for less intensive production methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections had forced him to withdraw sections of this package  for which he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years. He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older farmers to take early retirement  either taking their land out of agricultural production or passing it to successors. The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports to hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give full details  but member state aid would be subject to  strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition."
"2","Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta planthis month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels  director-general of the INFE export institute  Apolonio Ruiz Ligero  said.  The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now   he said.  This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy  which have a similar productive structure   he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans  tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine  as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan  while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand  which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.  The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition   he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand  while turning their backs on foreign markets.  They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation   he said.  Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."

"2","Charles Haughey  leader of the Irishparty Fianna Fail  said if he becomes prime minister following last month's Irish general election  he will seek the advice of the EC Commission on management of the country's 24 billion punt foreign debt. Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17 poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt management was made to him today by Commission president Jacques Delors. Haughey said:  Delors assured me we could have full recourse to the Commission for advice  guidance and expert skills in dealing with our overall financial problems  particularily in the matter of debt management.  Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion punts a year  he added : If we could achieve any significant improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of servicing  it could have significant budgetary benefits.  He added that he would seek advice  not a Community loan. However  Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at favorable interest rates  notably for onlending to its farming sector.  It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before and we would look at it again   he said. Haughey said he regarded as  almost paramount  the maintenance of the punt's current position within the European Monetary System. He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight pct last August.  Until 1983  the policy of the Irish government was to was to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I believe that policy was right   Haughey said."
"2","The suspension of Ecuador's crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months  a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline  which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline  the official  who did not want to be named  told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador  where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador  a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  was recently pumping about 260 000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude  about 50 000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel  another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year  it exported an average of 173 500 bpd  according to the central bank. However  Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline  costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs  to hook up with a Colombian pipeline  the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador  squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986  had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January  about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs  the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas  President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May  Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program  he said."
"2","French maize producers will ask the ECCommission to grant permanent maize export rebates following the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four years  the French maize producers association  AGPM  said. The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500 000 tonnes of French maize  of which rebates for around 100 000 tonnes have been granted. The request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500 000 tonnes  the AGPM said. The association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations  adding that the Soviet Union  which has important maize needs  is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500 000 tonnes of French maize. The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against 10.40 mln in 1985/86."
"2","Lending by the World Bank and its softloan arm  the International Development Agency (IDA)  to China is expected to almost double to about two billion dlrs by 1989/90 from the levels of 1984 to 1986  foreign bankers told Reuters. They said approved lending in 1986/87 (July-June) is expected to total 1.4 billion dlrs  of which 550 mln will come from the IDA and 850 mln from the World Bank. World Bank figures show approved lending to China by the two bodies amounted to 1.137 billion in 1985/86  1.102 billion in 1984/85 and 1.04 billion in 1983/84. The bankers said that 1.2 billion dlrs had been disbursed by the end of 1986 and China's disbursement record compares very favourably with that of other countries. They said Japan has so far been the main source of bilateral concessional assistance for China  followed by West Germany  Canada  Italy  Australia and Britain. But China will probably find that such funds will not increase  except for those from Japan and the World Bank  given other claims  particularly from sub-Saharan African countries which cannot raise commercial credits  they added."
"2","Ecuador's deputy energy ministerFernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake  officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude  to be repaid in kind after 180 days  to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota  set at 210 000 barrels per day for first half 1987.  All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production   a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired  officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level  officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota  or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter  and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake."
"2","It could be months before majorassistance is provided for Earthquake-stricken Ecuador  although the International Monetary Fund and the development banks have already taken the first steps  monetary sources and U.S. officials said. They said the IMF had informed the Ecuadorean government that it was prepared  under its emergency system  to provide about 50 mln dlrs  or about 25 per cent of the country's quota in the agency  but it is up to Ecuador to request the money. At the same time  the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have dispatched missions to the region hit by last Thursday's quake to determine what the country's needs are and how they can speed up disbursement of funds from programs already approved. The World Bank estimates that of the over one billion dlrs it has approved for Ecuador in recent years  some 277 mln dlrs has yet to be disbursed and a portion of this could  potentially  be made available. The bank said that the programs it has approved are for rural development  agriculture  water and sewerage  electrical power and others. If the assistance that is needed can be fit into these general categories  the funds could be then provided for from expedited disbursements"
"2","The World Bank said it has approveda 140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country's dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own petroleum resources.

"2","The U.S. Has given further detailsof an action program announced yesterday aimed at helping sub-Saharan Africa overcome hunger and economic problems  senior U.S. Offficials said. Under the new program  a 500-mln dlr Development Fund for Africa will be set up to consolidate most of the aid money going to the continent to replace the large number of bilateral accounts currently in existence. Chester Crocker  assistant secretary of state for Africa  said he believed Congress will favour the program  which stems from a U.N. Conference on Africa's economic problems. The 500-mln dlr fund  coupled with an additional 100 mln dlrs in food aid  would surpass Congress' 1986 vote of 483 mln dlrs for equivalent programs  officials said. Washington is also increasing its funding to the International Development Agency (IDA)  the World Bank's soft loan affiliate  and is seeking a greater share of a bigger fund for Africa  they said. Officials said under the last IDA replenishment Africa got 37 pct of 8.7 billion dlrs  but the Reagan administration wants this increased to 45-50 pct of 12.8 billion dlrs in new funds."
"2","Bangladesh will seek additional moneyfrom the World Bank to finance industrial development which is facing a capital shortage and a lack of expertise  Finance Ministry officials said. They said the government had revised downward its Annual Development Programme budget for this fiscal year by seven pct to 44.4 billion Taka. A team will visit Washington next month for talks with World Bank executives and to ask for 200 mln dlrs from the bank's Industrial Programme Credit scheme  they said. The new money would be in addition to nearly two billion dlrs aid which the World Bank  other leading agencies and donor countries are expected to offer Bangladesh for the year from July at their Paris meeting next month. They offered 1.85 billion dlrs to the country in 1986/87. The Annual Development Programme budget has been cut mainly because of poor tax collection and a fall in public and private sector industrial investment  the Finance Ministry officials said. They said they expect a two pct growth in the industrial sector this year  against a target of five pct and a growth of 1.5 pct in 1985. They gave no further details."

Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference the West German feed industry believes the EC does not seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it would end in another transatlantic trade war.  We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies.  American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected.

"2","Zambia has cleared its arrears to theIMF for 1985 with a 145 mln dlr bridging loan from Standard Chartered Bank  central bank president Leonard Chivuno said. The government had obtained a further loan of 45 mln dlr from the Bank of Credit and Commerce to help pay off its remaining 165 mln SDR arrears for 1986 and is currently negotiating loans from two other banks to complete payment  he told a press conference . To restrict liquidity all commercial banks will have to make a supplementary deposit with the Bank of Zambia  equivalent to 10 pct of their demand deposits  Chivanu added. Following the IMF talks  the fixed exchange rate will be adjusted against a basket of five major currencies  but it will not fall below 12.50 kwacha per dollar  Chivuno said. He was speaking after three weeks' discussions with the IMF centred on the revision of the exchange system.

"2","World food production over the next decadewill exceed population growth  but because of unequal distribution  many parts of the world will go hungry  the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. In a report to be considered by its agriculture committee at a meeting later this month  FAO said:  The long term trends point towards a further polarisation of the world food system.  Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubled by chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of the poorer countries and regions will still be faced by the combined problem of low nutritional levels  rapidly rising populations  inadequate growth in both food production and incomes...   FAO said. FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by the committee  which meets between March 23 and April 1. These included improving the international trading environment for agricutural commodities  reducing food surpluses in developed countries  conserving natural resources and speeding up the increase of food production in developing countries."

"2","A new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow  chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.  The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation   he told a news conference. The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference  held under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative prices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian/Singapore currency  he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the  may sell  and  may buy  points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price  as well as the  must sell  and  must buy  zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord.  The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply   he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550 000 tonnes  Xuto added. At this month's session  which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA  the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention ( may sell ) price (currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower intervention price ( may buy ) price (171 cents at present) for six months  the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact  the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly  when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300 000 tonnes  there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks  which began on March 9  producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the  lower indicative price  (or floor price) of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock  currently 360 000 tonnes  reached 450 000 tonnes. The proposal  initiated by the U.S.  was withdrawn last Friday  setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA  Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct."
"2","Two World Bank review teams are in thePhilippines to assess government requests for funding for an expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program  bank officials said. They told Reuters the housing program loan request is for 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs. The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr long-term loan from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its land reform program. The officials said negotiations will start next month on another 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reforms in 14 major state-owned corporations. On Tuesday  the world bank approved two loans totalling 310 mln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program. The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loans to finance geothermal and education projects  sources said. World Bank sources said the bank's lending to the Philippines since 1957  including the latest loan  totalled 4.3 billion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100 loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed. The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs in loan commitments to the Philippines during the last three years of President Ferdinand Marcos's rule. Marcos was toppled by a military-civilian revolt in February 1986.  The loans were cancelled because the projects slated for aid were not implemented properly   they said. The sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be used to rehabilitate the state-owned Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which are saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.  At least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans were supposed to go to the DBP   the World Bank sources said.  Over the past three years the bank's disbursement pipeline to the Philippines almost completely dried up.  In 1986 alone  the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos in loan repayments  about 59 pct of the government's budget deficit of 27 billion pesos for the year  they said. Agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle last September when President Corazon Aquino visited the U.S. The sources said the loan was held up because of delays by the government in submitting essential documents. The World Bank sources said the request for land reform funding would be discussed at a meeting of the World Bank-led consultative group to be held alongside the April 27-29 annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Osaka. The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants. The sources said the Philippine government estimated the entire program would cost 60 billion pesos.  About 27 billion is long-term and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly by landowners   they said.  The landowners will be paid in 10-year bonds redeemable in ten instalments.  The sources said the bulk of financing would cover development costs for the land program and help to bridge the gap between the 10-year spread of payments to landowners and a proposed 30-year loan repayment period for land buyers.  If you include interest  the total amount of external assistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs   the sources said.  That volume of aid does not appear difficult.  They said Japan  the World Bank and the ADB are expected to provide most of the financing while the Philippines' 12 bilateral aid donors would contribute the rest. The World Bank sources said lending to the Philippines is designed to support its balance of payments position while the government aims for a target of six to seven pct annual gross national product growth.  Brazil did not do this homework   one said.  They pushed ahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing for their balance of payments position. Manila is being more cautious and aims at soft borrowings which  it is hoped  will be outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result in the country emerging from debt in five or six years.  Philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs."

"2","A new International Natural RubberAgreement  INRA  was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today. The new accord is due to replace the current one  which expires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented  a historic moment.  The latest round of talks  which began March 9  represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years. Xuto described the negotiations as  by no means easy  and we often faced problems.  The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now  delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended  but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies  Xuto added. He also praised  the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session.  Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia  speaking on behalf of producers  said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is  a vital consideration for multinational tire companies  whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply.  He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact  to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France  speaking for consumers  agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed  he said  consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning. He added that the adoption of the new agreement  attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry."
"2","Bolivia  once Latin America's mostdelinquent debtor  is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan  a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed  Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF  its first since 1980  opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil  which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club  which have yet to be finalised  had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue  he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies  including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank  although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs  up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23 000 pct a year  state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages  set a market- related rate for the peso  introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months  according to the Central Bank  and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks  some 900 mln dlrs  on which interest has not been paid since March  1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal  but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal  mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps  similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps  but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run  especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable  Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin  which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984  has collapsed on the world markets  and gas  the country's major revenue earner  is in abundant supply in the region."
"2","Indonesia has protested to the EuropeanCommunity (EC) about its plan to raise import duties on vegetable oils  which will affect the country's palm oil exports to the EC  Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said.  Indonesia  both individually and together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports   he told Indonesian reporters.  We very much regret the community's plan   he added. He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made. Indonesia is a major palm oil producer. According to central bank figures  Indonesia exported 362 700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301 400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986. Complete 1986 figures are not yet available. Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said recently that the increase in EC duties would add a new burden to ASEAN countries at a time when they were trying to strengthen their economies in the face of lower commodity prices."
"2","The world's dependency on the Mideastas the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it  Donald K. McIvor  an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.  Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable   McIvor said. Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence  McIvor said. McIvor  Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.  Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year   McIvor said.  The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity   he added. McIvor said that of the some 30 000 oil fields discovered so far only 37  one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.  McIvor said  in response to a question  that he did not believe there were any more  super giants   or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels  to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.  Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope).  McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east  particulartly in Canada  the North Sea  and Australia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.  The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies   McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy. Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but  the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.  McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.  Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply   McIvor said.  Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat  as an industrial fuel   he added."

He told an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the widening gap between industrialized and developing countries and an unfair international economic system were major obstacles to growth in developing countries.  I wish to emphasize that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries   Mamman said. Delegates from 23 countries are attending the talks of the world trade body in the New Zealand resort of Taupo."

A two year extension is possible."
"2","A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter  in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks  told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.  That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round   he said.  The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.  The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed  he said.  Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round   he said. But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.  It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two   he said.  They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future   he said."
"2","State-owned Agricultural Bank of Chinais to form a bank with the World Bank to  support China's agricultural development and speed up its modernisation  in the special economic zone of Xiamen  the People's Daily overseas edition said. It gave no further details  but a Chinese banker said the new International Agricultural Development Bank had capital of less than 100 mln dlrs and would act mostly as an investment bank  lending to farm processing businesses and rural factories. He said the World Bank unit is the International Finance Corp  which lends to private firms."
"2","A ban by a Portuguese court on thestate buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders will remain unless it is reversed in Portugal or challenged in the European Court of Justice  European Commission sources said. They denied a statement yesterday by Portuguese Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto that the commission had accepted that EPAC should be eligible  saying it had taken no view in the matter. Under the terms of Portugal's accession to the European Community  a grain import monopoly held by EPAC is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part  as it had done in the past  in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports."
"2","A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter  in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks  told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.  That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round   he said.  The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.  The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed  he said.  Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.  But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries  but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.  It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two   he said.  They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future   he said."
"2","Emergency action to distributeEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme  a Commission spokesman said. Almost 60 000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20  when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme  and March 13  according to latest commission figures. The food  including 30 000 tonnes of cereals  6 000 tonnes of sugar  4 000 tonnes of beef and 13 300 tonnes of butter  has been distributed to the needy through charities. The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31. But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system. The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers. However  commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates. On the other hand  the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter  520 000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules  with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.  Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday   a consumer delegate said.  The atmosphere is excellent.  Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1  if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a  very interesting stage of negotiations   delegates said. The package  based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates  has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers  the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal  the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired  delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis  rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before  giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin  similar to golf handicaps  to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins  they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager  the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock  they said. The purchases would be limited to 5 000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20 000 tonnes per week  and could be bought in nearby  intermediate and forward positions  they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is  transparency   meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible  delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985  when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds  cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism  they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow  as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline  when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn  delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed. Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules  producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices  delegates said."

"2","The Ferruzzi Group's holding companyAgricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies  a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said. When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York  it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5 000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year  or about one third of EC production  from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake  and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas  of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share  and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future  notably in the production of ethanol for fuel. Raul Gardini  president of the Ferruzzi Group  said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts."

The Turkish embassy here said an application was expected  very soon  but gave no date. But sources close to the embassy said the application for full EC membership would probably be made in April  or at the latest  by the first week of May. Bozer  is due to meet Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal in London today to decide on the date of the application  they added."
"2","Energy and Mines Minister ArturoHernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to achieve price recovery and stabilize the market. Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the market  the danger of a reversal is always present.  March and the next two or three months will be a really critical period   Hernandez said. He said   We will be able to define a movement  either towards market stability and price recovery or  depending on the market  a reversal.  Earlier this week  Hernandez said Venezuela's oil price has averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average price  he said  Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs. Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean oil exporters  formed in 1983. Ministers from member states Ecuador  Mexico  Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day conference  while Colombia is present for the first time as an observer. Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of ideas about the oil market. However  the members will also discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil currently before the U.S. Congress. Following the opening session  the group of ministers met with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores  the presidential palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by Hernandez of Venezuela  Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of Ecuador  Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago  Jose Luis Alcudiai  assistant energy secretary of Mexico and Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia."

"2","Yugoslavia said it has been asked toparticipate in the production of a new Soviet airliner -- the Ilyushin 114. The official Tanjug news agency said this was decided at a meeting in Havana of officials of the Soviet-led trade group Comecon. Yugoslavia is a communist nonaligned state  belonging neither to the Warsaw Pact or the Western alliance  Nato  but it enjoys preferential trading status in Comecon.  Under the deal  Yugoslavia will produce several major parts  including the landing gear  for the new medium-range 80-passenger Ilyushin airliner  Tanjug said. No financial details were disclosed."
"2","The World Bank said it approved a 90mln dlr loan to Yugoslavia's third largest bank to support a project promoting energy conservation and substituting lower-cost energy sources for present sources. It said the loan consists of a credit line to Ljubljanska Banka  Ljubljana (LBL)  to finance a project expected to improve industrial competitiveness and reduce energy imports  easing the country's current balance-of-payments difficulties. The loan will also support development of technical capabilities for energy audit work and strengthen the financial and institutional capability of LBL  the Bank said. The Bank said the project will benefit small and medium-sized industries  primarily in Yugoslavia's Republic of Slovenia. It said 600 000 dlrs of the loan will cover the foreign exchange costs of consultancy services  equipment and training abroad for technical and financial personnel."

"2","The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said ithad approved two loans amounting to 75.7 mln dollars for agricultural projects in Bangladesh and Nepal. It said both loans are repayable over 40 years  including a 10-year grace  and carry a service charge of one pct a year. The bank said it approved 51.7 mln for an agricultural inputs program for Bangladesh aimed at sustaining foodgrain production. It said the loan will cover the entire foreign exchange component of the project's total cost of 65 mln. The ADB said it approved 24 mln dlrs to support an agricultural credit project in Nepal. The loan will benefit Nepal by increasing foodgrain output  augmenting production of milk and other dairy products and expanding energy generation in rural areas  it said."
"2","The African Development Bank (ADB) saidit increased its lending by 42.1 pct last year to 1.64 billion dlrs from 1.15 billion dlrs in 1985. A bank statement said agriculture  set as the main growth area in a five-year economic recovery program adopted in 1985 by African states  received 607 mln dlrs  37 pct of the total. The ADB is made up of the bank itself  its financing soft-loan arm  the African Development Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund  another soft-loan institution. ADB president Babacar N'Diaye released a 1987 economic report on Africa prepared by the ADB and the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  saying progress was being made toward substantial increases in the bank's capital resources. He said an ad-hoc committee of the ADB board of governors  comprising 18 African and non-African countries  recommended a 200 pct increase in the organisation's capital for 1987-91. He said such an increase would raise capital from around 6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs  adding he was hopeful the proposal would be adopted at the annual meetings of the bank and fund  due to be held jointly in Cairo in June. He welcomed France's recent proposals to the Paris Club of Western government creditors to extend repayment periods for Third World debts and give better rescheduling terms.  The proposition represents a major step forward. But African countries should not be the ones to ask for large-scale debt write-offs   he said. Africa's total external debt was estimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986. The ECA-ADB report said prospects would remain bleak for African economies in 1987 but predicted Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct  compared with 1.2 pct last year."
"2","Japan will seek to strengthen theParis accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow  Japanese officials said. However  the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified  would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord  which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February  to be strengthened. Currency target zones  or reference ranges  will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow  the Japanese officials said. The meeting  which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions  will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord  the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates  officials said  but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan  which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency  but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus  Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7  the officials said. However  Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet  or parliament  despite the new fiscal year which started April one  the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5 000 billion yen in additional spending."

"2","China is likely to succeed in joiningGATT despite policies that contradict free trade  because western countries support its entry  western diplomats said. China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation  formed in 1948 to integrate the world's free market economies  now regulates 80 pct of world trade. The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and complex entry negotiations  the diplomats said. One diplomat said China's prospects are good  with its application supported by the United States  Japan and the European Community for political and economic reasons.  The fear is that if China was refused entry  it would draw back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was   he said. Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.  If GATT accepted China  it would be hard not to accept the Soviet Union   he said.  China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body.  But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks  including China's pricing system and trade subsidies. GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and promote trade  with prices alone dictating who buys what. One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state and often contain subsidies.  Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try to find out the real cost of something  officials do not give you a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do not want to answer   he said. China's position  as set out in a memorandum to GATT in February  is that it is gradually reforming its price system to bring prices in line with real production costs and replace administrative controls with market ones. Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However  China would not apply for membership on similar terms  but rather as a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment. He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are small  while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.  It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal  for instance   the diplomat said.  It could have a very large impact on world trade.  Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its companies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for vitally needed technology  equipment and raw materials. A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of grain it exported  because it had to make up the difference between a low world price and a high domestic price. A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade bureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies might be as high as 100 pct for some products.  When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole country  he referred me to the Ministry of Finance  adding with a grin that they would not tell me   he said. He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of the sensitivity of the subject.  Unless something is done to change this  China will find many countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from China   the diplomat added. In a major speech on the economy late last month  Planning Minister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.  While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign exchange  we must improve economic accounting practices and reduce the cost of exports   he said. One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign trade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT principles could conflict with domestic pressures. China has said there will be no major price reforms this year following widespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to stable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.  So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China reform its economy?   the diplomat said.  How can it balance the requirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?  But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the end outweigh these problems.  China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a part of the world economy   he said.  Just as China would get increased access to foreign markets  so it would have to give more access to its domestic market to foreign countries."

"2","The European Commission was authorisedto buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores in the second half of June  although sales into intervention normally end on April 30  Commission sources said. They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC and the United States. The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years. The sources said the intervention price for the maize would be 201.49 Ecus a tonne. They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April 30 deadline  which could be caused by speculation about the implementation of the accord with the United States."

"2","The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s  according to John H. Lichtblau  president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau  speaking at an alternative energy conference here  said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995  surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977.  The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable   Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations  he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990.  However  the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction   Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.  An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone   Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil  Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices  he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling  to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy."

"2","Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports  but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness  or at least the ability  of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However  they said an all-out trade war may be far off  as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs  which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT  would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March  up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986  Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs  up 4.5 pct from 1985  while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris  trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However  British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast  West Germany  with the EC's most successful economy  has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions  preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years  substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present  it is  for instance  pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits  to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport  and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits  but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress  however  that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam  they point out."

"2","Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports  but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness  or at least the ability  of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However  they said an all-out trade war may be far off  as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs  which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT  would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March  up from 1.94 billion in February."
"2","A senior Abu Dhabi oil official saidin remarks published today the emirate  largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)  was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords. Khalaf al-Oteiba  Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC)  told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.  The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production   he said.  The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market   he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year  when world oil prices dropped  was ADNOC's most difficult ever but  a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.  He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609 000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes  of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985  ADNOC marketed a total of 476 000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products."
"2","The General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) will begin a probe on May 7-8 on the legality of Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products  Agriculture Ministry officials said. The investigation  which will take place in Geneva  follows a U.S. Complaint last year that the restrictions violated GATT rules prohibiting import quotas. The products involved include fruit juice  peanuts and tomato juice."
"2","Bank profits in the Gulf oil state ofQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are retrenching further in one of the region s most overbanked markets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for several foreign banks  although locally-owned operations were in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market share. &lt;Qatar National Bank SAQ> s (QNB) General Manager  Abdulla Khalid al-Attiya  said:  The economy is not improving as we hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks.  Oil-dependent Qatar  with a tiny indigenous population of 60 000 to 80 000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about 280 000  boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank operations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide recession  aggravated this year by Qatar s severe difficulty marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices  has taken a heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result  the only U.S. Bank  &lt;Citibank NA>  is thought to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing locally based &lt;Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started operations in 1984  bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched  with &lt;Standard Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow. &lt;Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit 51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local business  bankers said. One banker added:  Weak profits are here to stay for the time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment.  Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to fixed prices. However  it soon became apparent that Qatar was having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been running in recent weeks at 100 000 and 120 000 barrels per day  well down on the nation s OPEC quota of 285 000  oil sources said. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar s revenue has led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to private contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits last year  as did the introduction of minimum reserve requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks  QNB conducts the bulk of the government s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage its rivals cannot expect to match  bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1 mln Qatari riyals  while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to 9.0 billion  making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging loans for the public and private sector to tide government departments and local business over the lean economic spell  Attiya said.  Generally speaking  we are overbanked in Qatar   he said  echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest  &lt;Doha Bank Ltd QSC>  reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to 27.5 mln riyals  while &lt;Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>  registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank  continued to expand rapidly and reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the start-up period from August 4  1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks  increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to reexamine their staffing levels and overheads. &lt;Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit in 1985 of 12 000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf  the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered  also found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in 1985  but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985 s result had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.  Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline  while local banks are increasing their market share   Farquharson said. BBME s operating profit was steady in 1986  edging up to 12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985.  We are expecting the same level of operating profit in 1987   Farquharson said. Standard Chartered s net profit last year recovered slightly to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161 000 in 1985. Staff numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore."
"2","The Philippines has received a 300mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank  Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters. Ongpin said the loan  carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year  matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the World Bank in March. Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed. Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and 80 billion yen. The aid package  originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87 fiscal year ended March  was delayed because of the Philippines' change of government last year.  The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49 billion yen   he said.  But they are likely to bring it up to that level for the 15th package.  Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the 14th yen package.  We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of untied commodity loans   he said. Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft loans to finance a land reform program  for which Japan is expected to supply most of the financing  had been put off until next month because of delays in preparatory work. Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here. Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed leader Ferdinand Marcos.  But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the field of lending to the private sector   he said. The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower after Pakistan in 1986  with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs. Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in 1987 to reach the same level.  They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we want. But we have to come up with the projects   he said."
"2","India  which received its firstloans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986  expects to increase borrowing this year  an Indian official said. The official  a member of the Indian delegation at the ADB's annual meeting here  told Reuters the bank is likely to approve three loans totalling between 350 and 400 mln dlrs in 1987  up from the 250 mln in two loans in 1986. The official said negotiations on a 100 mln dlr loan for the modernisation of the Haldia and Madras ports had been completed and only need approval by the bank's board. The official said an ADB team is now in India for a survey of the second project involving imports of railway locomotives. He said the bank was also likely to extend a credit line to the Industrial Development Bank of India. The ADB in 1986 extended a 100 mln dlr line of credit to state-owned Industrial Finance Corp of India. The official said the ADB wants to gradually expand lending to India.  They (the bank) do not want their traditional borrowers from smaller countries in the region to get overwhelmed by (India and China)   he said. China is expected to receive its first ADB loan this year.  We are quite satisfied at having opened this new window in borrowing   the official said.  Our projects are being vetted quickly. We have no complaints.  He said the ADB in any case would not be able to match Indian borrowing needs.  In fiscal 1986/87 ending June India will borrow two billion dlrs from the World Bank alone   he said.  That represents the total ADB lending to all its borrowers in 1986.  The official said total Indian development assistance from multilateral and bilateral creditors is likely to total four billion dlrs in 1986/87. Asked to comment on U.S. Criticism of the quality of ADB lending  the official said:  The ADB is a regional bank and ought to have a better understanding of realities in Asia.   You cannot apply World Bank conditionalities everywhere   he said.  The U.S. Cannot impose one yardstick for every country."

It is a plot by China to downgrade Taiwan's status in the organisation   Foreign Ministry spokesman Cheyne Chiu told a news conference."
"2","Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa opened the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank by holding out the promise of more Japanese money for the organisation.  We are ... Striving to enhance the flow of capital from Japan to the developing countries   he said.  The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern for us in our bilateral and multilateral assistance.  He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a special Japanese fund at the ADB  like the one at the World Bank. The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developing countries. Developing countries and the United States have criticised Japan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poor countries. Later this week  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is expected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend as much as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the next three years  Japanese officials said. The exta ADB funding would be part of that amount.  Our cooperation is intended to contibute to ... Alleviating the burden on (developing countries)   said Miyazawa  who is also chairman of the ADB board of governors.  The developing countries today find themselves in a very difficult situation   he said.  With a few notable exceptions  those countries that are highly dependent upon commodity exports face a rough road ahead.  While the developing countries can help themselves by striving to become internationally competitive and seeking to attract foreign investment  the ADB also has a role to play  he said. Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up its economic advice program to developing nations and must work vigorously to identify development projects for loans. He also called for more use of loans that were not tied to development projects  but provided more overall help to the borrower. ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view.  The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor   Fujioka said.  The bank will now have to equip itself to meet a range of services required to attend to varied needs of its developing members.  Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow its Export-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans. These would not have to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment. Tokyo was also prepared to let the Asian Development Bank raise more funds in Tokyo and financial markets should it need to do so  he said."

"2","The Sixth International Tin Agreement ITA  has been extended for two years from July 1  1987  the International Tin Council  ITC  said. The extension was formally agreed at a resumed special session of the council held here this morning and follows a session early this month when the council agreed in principle to extend the pact but had to await the formal approval of some member governments. The extension will enable the council to continue with its statistical work and studies of the tin industry."
"2","Egypt has embarked on reforms sought bythe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank by raising the price of diesel oil and other types of transport fuels. The energy price increases were the first visible measures taken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans. Effective today  fuel oil prices were trebled and prices of gas oil  diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct  an Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He said fuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton  instead of 7.5 pounds. Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for five piasters a litre  while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters. The government is expected also to act soon  possibly as early as next weekend  to simplify the country's complex exchange rate system  bankers said. Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the pound was part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditor governments. In return  Egypt stands to receive up to one billion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years to help it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guarantee rescheduling by western governments  the main creditors. Energy price increases were also a condition of progress on World Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy  communications and other sectors which have been under negotiation for several months  western diplomats said. The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backing for President Hosni Mubarak's government  committed to a multi-party political system and peace with Israel and strategically poised in control of the Suez Canal. Fuel price rises  postponed at least once and likely to lead to higher retail prices of basic goods  were a test of the government's resolve to pursue economic reform  diplomats said. But the new prices are still below world market levels. There was no announcement of increases in more politically sensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas  used for cooking  and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said they would stay the same. Official comment was not available on speculation among bankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinker with the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollars into the banking system away from the illegal but tolerated free market. The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee in which 10 commercial banks  including the four state-owned banks  would decide the pound's value every day. The official  incentive rate   currently set by the Central Bank daily  is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar  against 2.15 on the free market. Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set rates around 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aim of curbing the free market."

"2","Foreign Ministers of the Associationof South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) said they expect closer economic ties with Japan. A communique issued at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting said Asean hoped for greater Japanese investment in the region  better access for Asean products in the Japanese market and larger numbers of visiting Japanese tourists. The ministers are due to start four days of talks tomorrow with officials of the U.S.  Japan  the European Community  New Zealand  Australia and Canada  including Secretary of State George Shultz and Japan's Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari. The Asean communique noted Japan's large trade surplus  which it said would enable Tokyo to play a greater role in the economic development of ASEAN and in facilitating closer ASEAN economic cooperation.  Japan could also help to facilitate the flow of Japanese investments to ASEAN through the provision of attractive financial assistance and incentives for its private sector   it said. The communique also welcomed President Reagan's firm action in vetoing trade protectionist measures in the Congress. The communique said the ASEAN ministers were concerned over the proliferation of protectionist policies  pressures and measures in developed countries  the continued depressed level of commodity prices  the instability of exchange rates and the lack of a comprehensive solution to the world debt situation."

The fund said 60 mln dlrs of the loan is available through the so-called structural adjustment facility (SAF) over the next three years. The fund said 57.5 mln dlrs will be available immediately under the SAF and a separate financing arrangement. After expanding in the early 1980's  Uganda's economy has suffered setbacks since 1984 of falling industrial and agricultural output and accelerating inflation  the fund said. The current economic downturn has been worsened by the sharp decline in the world price of coffee  Uganda's major export  the fund said."

"2","France's growth rate is expected tostrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half  but unemployment will worsen  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In its semi-annual review of the world economy  the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends  but significantly higher than in the first half of this year. The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987. Activity has slowed  primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment  while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated  the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988. The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986  it added. The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year  a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year  sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct."
"2","Sudan has set aside 781.6 mln dlrs toservice foreign debts in 1987/88  according to budget plans presented to parliament. This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debt repayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debt totalling 10.6 billion dlrs. Finance Minister Beshir Omar  presenting plans to parliament last night  put the budget deficit at 2.88 billion pounds  against 2.85 billion in 1986/87. He said the budget would be the first in a four-year economic recovery plan to be announced by the end of December. Of the total set aside for debt servicing  Omar said 574.6 mln dlrs would go to principal and 207 mln to interest payments. Sudan has an annual debt liability of 900 mln dlrs  Khartoum-based Western experts say. Omar said last March it would be difficult   if not impossible   for Sudan to meet scheduled debt repayments of 4.17 billion dlrs over the next five years. He said last night Sudan was 2.6 billion dlrs in arrears on debt repayments in the first half of this year. The experts say Sudan owes 23 pct of its foreign debt to Western government creditors  32 pct to governments of Eastern bloc and Arab countries and 21 pct to commercial banks  with most of the rest owed to multilateral sources. Sudan  unable to fully service its debts since 1985 and declared ineligible last year by the International Monetary Fund for fresh loans  has been servicing only creditors banned from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears. Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9 billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds. He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans  government deposits and other sources. Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidising sugar and wheat flour prices in 1987/88. He said some of Sudan's Western backers were witholding aid until an agreement with the IMF was reached. Sudan  which owes the IMF 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears  is scheduled to hold fresh talks with the Fund in late July or August on reforming its economy and clearing arrears."
"2","Japan will ratify the 1986 InternationalCocoa Agreement (ICCA)  with effect from July 1  and will renew its membership in the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO)  Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said. They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy. The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987. Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue  the officials said."
"2","Ecuador will produce crude oil in excessof its 221 000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year  Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference. Ecuador plans to produce 280 000 bpd in August  rising to 320 000 bpd next January  the minister said.  We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela  Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months   he said. Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year. Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna  when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221 000 bpd from 210 000 was approved.  They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement   he said. Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250 000-260 000 bpd  with 144 000 bpd exported. While its production was down  Venezuela  Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products  Santos said."
"2","The International Monetary Fund saidit approved a 48 mln dlr loan to assist Ecuador in meeting its foreign exchange needs following the earthquakes that struck in March. The loan  which the IMF provides countries under special circumstances  is equal to 25 pct of Ecuador's quota  or economic standing  in the Fund. The IMF said that according to recent estimates  the earthquakes will hurt the country's balance of payments this year because of the loss of oil revenues due to destruction of part of the oil pipeline."

"2","Indonesia told the oil industry onTuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate  but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto  in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association  said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.  In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry  the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws   Suharto said.  Apart from that  the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry   he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration.  As we all have heard this morning  the President is fully aware of this situation   Subroto said.  The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia  albeit on a selective basis.  Indonesia  one of the 13 members of OPEC  must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade  oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems  including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies  and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly  the President of state oil company Pertamina  has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas  such as when a field is designated commercial  and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical  and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts  even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years.  This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.  Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001  industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective  based on how much capital would be invested."
"2","U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month  although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal.  We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway   Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains  and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years  and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However  the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism  Lyng said  The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.   I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.  Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started.  All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us   Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils  he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC. The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz  recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture."
"2","Britain's highest court has decided theInternational Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC documents in court actions. On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what extent ITC documents  whether circulated or not  are admissible as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days. On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early January  they added. The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988. The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member governments of the tin council. Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the Court of Appeal legal schedule."

"2","Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers  called for action to help the Spanish maize market  Spanish diplomatic sources said. Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year  they said. They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year. Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases. The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market. They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help. The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the meeting."
