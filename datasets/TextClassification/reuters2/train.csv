"2","The dollar opened slightly lower in quiettrading  with dealers holding back ahead of the outcome of this week's top-level international monetary talks in Washington. The dollar began here at 1.5128/5138 Swiss francs  down from the previous 1.5185/5195 close and the 1.5180/5190 francs in New York. However  dealers were sceptical that anything other than a mere reaffirmation of February's Paris Accord was likely to emerge from Washington.  The dollar is likely to stay stable or drift slowly down   predicted one dealer at a major U.S. Bank. The Swiss franc was also slightly higher against the other major currencies. Sterling began at 2.4526/4557 francs  down from the previous 2.4547/4578 francs close  while the mark slipped to 83.09/19 centimes from 83.11/21 centimes. The French franc opened at 24.97/25.00 centimes from the previous 24.98/25.02 centimes close."

"1","Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its returnto profit reflected reduced costs  improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final  dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity  though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>  permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs  it said. As previously reported Comalco's &lt;Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale  Washington  and port facilities at Portland  Oregon to &lt;Columbia Aluminium Corp>. Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts. The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision."
"2","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that  since bilateral trade began in 1972  China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all  mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that  if China wants to obtain GSP status  it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  for which it applied in July 1986  and  not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.  The official said China was well aware of the laws  some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's  but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years  which the U.S. Side won  he said. But  for the first time  China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods  which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case  he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.  China has the potential to disrupt world markets  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT   the diplomat said. Poland  Czechoslovakia  Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT.  The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type   Shultz said.  China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation   he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs  especially for exports  and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month  China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with  guidance planning  and economic levers. The diplomat said that  to join GATT  China had much to do."

"2","China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports  to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports  provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports   the editorial said.  The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years  control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries   it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy  Chen Shibiao  who said that  all kinds of difficulties and restrictions  were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour  curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation."

"2","Japanese short-term interest rates buoyed recently by seasonal factors  are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins  money traders said. The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23  they said. The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three  and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions. Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases  the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure  money traders said. Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates  they said. Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September. This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17 830 billion yen by the end-December  a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels  bankers said. On March 31  the money market expects to see a 2 000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds  money traders said. From April 1  they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635 pct. They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to 3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25."
"2","The Federal Reserve may intervene inthe government securities market to add reserves today  some economists said  although others felt that the Fed was likely to refrain from any action. Those who believed the Fed will intervene said it would probably add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. But others noted the Fed's current add-need is not large. They also expected the federal funds rate to edge lower. Fed funds  which averaged 6.21 pct on Monday  opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained at that level in early trading."
"2","Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkovdescribed the Soviet Union's economic management system as obsolete and called on the Supreme Soviet  the nominal parliament  to adopt a draft law on major economic reform. In a speech to the 1 500 member body  Ryzhkov said excessive central control by Moscow-based ministries and wasteful use of resources had led to a situation where 13 pct of Soviet industrial enterprises were making a loss in 1986. He said the public faced acute food and housing problems and a  shadow economy  was growing because the state could not meet demand. He added that the USSR had failed to keep up with the technology revolution.  The methods of the past system of economic management have become obsolete   Ryzhkov declared.  The need for change is evident and urgent.  Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev  who set the tone last week with a frank speech on the economy  was present during the speech. The legislation outlined by Ryzhkov  formally called the draft law on state enterprises  is expected to be approved by the Supreme Soviet  to take effect next January 1. Under the law  all enterprises are to become financially self-supporting by taking charge of income and outlay  with wages tied to profit in order to increase worker incentive. Firms will compete for orders from the state  which are due to decline as direct contracts between enterprises expand. Ryzhkov said the state planning agency  Gosplan  would be restructured to set national economic priorities instead of administering factories directly through five year plans.  We need a fundamentally new approach to yearly planning   he added  saying annual central plans would be abandoned from 1991 and enterprises charged with developing their own plans.  He said scientific research should be integrated closely with industry to make up a technology gap with the West and enterprises should use market research to meet consumer demand. Ryzhkov blamed the state supply body  Gossnab  for allowing shortages to occur. He said Gossnab was hoarding 27 billion roubles worth of raw materials and semi-finished products of enterprises. He said Gossnab should help expand wholesale trade. Ryzhkov said improved economic management of consumer goods and services was required to stem increasing speculation and the growth of the black market economy. He called for a 10 fold increase in the number of cooperatives to help in this field. He said the price system needed radical revision to accurately reflect supply and demand  with the state setting prices only for  products of national importance  in changes to be fully in place by the next five year plan beginning in 1991. The practice of using credit to cover losses must also stop. Outstanding debts to the state had reached 40 billion roubles. He said there were proposals to replace the  cumbersome  banking system with six new banks -- a state bank and banks for foreign economic relations  agro-industry  construction  housing and commercial services  and credit. Ryzhkov said guarantees should be built into the law to prevent  the distortion of the rights of enterprises.  But non-profitable enterprises would be declared bankrupt if efforts to make them self-supporting failed. Bemoaning the  economic illiteracy  of many managers  he called for the retraining of economic personnel. Ryzhkov said an immense amount of work lay ahead and  doing it on the go  would be difficult  but added   We do not have time to stop and ponder.  He said the changes should  give a new image to socialism."
"2","International Coffee Organization (ICO)exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption before presenting it to importers tomorrow  ICO delegates said. The change  which will be discussed tonight informally among producers  follows talks after the formal producer session with the eight-member producer splinter group and will affect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from April one  they said. The proposed share-out would still include shortfall declarations  they said."
"2","Leaders of Italy's five coalition partieshave agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats. Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week  allowing negotiations on a new government leader. The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last August  under which he was to hand over the prime minister's job next month  was unlikely to be fulfilled. Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely to leave the coalition  which also includes Republicans  Social Democrats and Liberals  unless they get the prime minister's job. They said Craxi's plans to resign show he has decided to stick to the pact but talks on a leader  a government program and sharing of ministries will not be easy. They said there is dissent among the partners and that Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether formation of a new government is feasible or early elections are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988."
"2","South Korea plans to take steps to keepits 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs  Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said. Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from rising too quickly. Last year South Korea's current account surplus was 4.65 billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484 mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln in January 1986  Bank of Korea figures show."
"2","Kuwait's oil minister said in a newspaperinterview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying that  none of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd). Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits."
"2","Cuba has told international sugaroperators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets  dealers here said. Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts. The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop  worry over Brazil's export availability  and increasing Soviet demand  analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery  and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes. Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets  traders said."
"2","Early dollar straight eurobond trade wasquiet with currency sectors  particularly eurosterling  continuing to perform strongly  closely reflecting current trading patterns on the foreign exchanges  dealers said. Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily  bolstered by the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals. The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January. The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be weak  placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading impetus  one dollar straight trader said.  It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how anybody is going to make any money   he said. Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of the domestic equity markets. Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point. However  some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels. Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany. There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week. FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian -- banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.  (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis after things had more or less quietened down following the first shock statements last week   one FRN specialist said. Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight secondary market  two new dollar issues were the only early features on the primary market. These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4 pct. The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 -- for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct  with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager. Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due mainly to a lack of fresh  good name paper in the market."

"2","Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea  Hong Kong and Singapore  a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level."
"2","Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi andhis five-party coalition government have resigned  officials said. A statement from the Quirinal presidential palace said head of state Francesco Cossiga had reserved his decision on whether to accept the resignation  normal procedure when a government stands down.

"2","Thousands of Spanish farmers battledpolice in this northeastern city during a march to demand a better deal from the EC  protest organisers said. The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings in Saragossa. In the southern city of Malaga  citrus growers dumped more than 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets to protest against duties levied by the EC against their exports. Spain joined the community in January last year and farmers say they have suffered competition from EC imports without sufficient compensation."
"2","Deputy oil ministers of the six-nationGulf Co-operation Council (GCC) ended a meeting here after discussing co-ordination and co-operation in the oil field  the Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency (GNA) said. The deputy ministers  who declined to talk to reporters on the outcome of the 90 minute formal session  later concluded a round of informal talks. The GCC groups four OPEC members -- Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  and non-OPEC nations Bahrain and Oman. Before the formal session had begun  chairman Yousef Shirawi  Bahrain's Development and Industry Minister  told reporters the gathering was a follow-up to talks held last Sunday in Qatar at full ministerial level. GNA gave no details on the outcome of today's talks. It said only   The deputy ministers discussed current developments in the oil market  particularly those relating to production and prices.  The meeting in Qatar had reaffirmed the six Gulf Arab countries' commitment to OPEC's pricing and production accord forged in December last year. It also discussed ways of marketing crude oil on behalf of those GCC states encountering resistance to official OPEC prices. Oil industry sources have said Qatar has faced particular difficulty in selling its full quota of production."
"2","European Community  EC  agricultureministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at high guaranteed EC prices  diplomats said. The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations. The accord  which is due to operate from the start of the new milk marketing year on April 1  was hailed as the most significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses. Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened if the proposals are altered too radically. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into public stores when market prices and stocks are high. Faced with a butter  mountain  of a record 1.2 mln tonnes costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store  EC farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged to cut production to meet demand. He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales to other sectors such as cereals."
"2","The South Korean government will float150 billion won in exchange equalisation bonds this month  Ministry of Finance officials said. The Bank of Korea will issue the bonds  to be launched with an annual interest rate of 11 pct  a bank official said. The float  the first of its kind  is a response to the nation's increasing current account surplus  and is designed to limit the growth in M-2 money supply to 18 pct  he said. South Korea's M-2 supply in February totalled 33 992 billion won  18.89 pct up on the year-earlier figure."
"2","The overall area devoted to sugarbeet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986  West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year  Licht said  but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha  against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates  in 1 000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets)  are  Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118)  Denmark 69 (69)  France 419 (421)  Greece 35 (44)  Ireland 36 (38)  Italy 270 (275)  Netherlands 129 (138)  Portugal 1 (1)  Spain 192 (190)  U.K. 200 (201)  West Germany 385 (399)  Austria 32 (28)  Finland 30 (31)  Sweden 51 (52)  Switzerland 15 (14)  Turkey 355 (340)  Yugoslavia 160 (136). Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows  USSR 3400 (3440)  Albania 10 (9)  Bulgaria 52 (50)  Czechoslovakia 195 (196)  East Germany 210 (205)  Hungary 108 (96)  Poland 460 (440)  Romania 295 (280). On the basis of average yields this year  Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes  raw value  down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season  thanks to favourable weather  and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields  EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87  while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87."
"2","While most of the world's financialmarkets will be monitoring the U.K. budget  traders and analysts in the U.S. credit market will be pouring over latest housing starts data for fresh clues about current and future domestic growth trends  economists said. Most economists expect the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate to ease to about 1.75 mln units in February from just under 1.81 mln in both January and December.  The level of housing starts is likely to have declined modestly but still have remained at a relatively high level   said Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co Inc. Unfortunately  meaningful comparisons between February's and prior months' underlying trends may prove difficult.  Caution should be used when interpreting (December's and January's) increase   cautioned Smith Barney's Greenbaum.  Although underlying fundamentals remain strong -- mortgage rate stability  healthy income gains -- warmer than usual weather undoubtedly also had some influence in pushing starts higher in both months   he added. Economists at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc were more succinct in a weekly newsletter:  a slight decline across the board  no particular economic reason  mostly weather.  Charles Lieberman of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp said single-family homes would account for most of the housing starts drop although Smith Barney's Greenbaum saw signs of stabilization in both the single- and multi-family sectors. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker is also due to appear before a Congressional committee Tuesday morning. Federal funds are expected to open at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct after being quoted at 6-3/16 late yesterday. U.S. government securities prices continued to drift aimlessly yesterday  with the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond closing 7/32 lower at 99-25/32."
"2","The Bank of Spain suspended its dailymoney market assistance and offered to drain funds with three- and seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct  money market sources said. The sources said the measures were a further attempt to rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions to scramble for funds before the 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements closes on Monday. The bank  which raised its rate for ordinary overnight assistance to 13-3/4 from 13-1/2 pct on Wednesday  opened its special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 14-1/2 pct. Money market sources said institutions in need of funds were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further assistance. The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more likely to open its special borrowing facility again."
"2","Enough European Community (EC) statesappear to be opposed to the proposals by the EC Commission for a 330 European currency unit (Ecu) a tonne tax on vegetable oils  fats and marine oils to block adoption by EC ministers  British Farm Minister Michael Jopling said. He told a news conference held during a meeting here of EC agriculture ministers that Britain  West Germany  the Netherlands  Denmark  and Portugal were all against the tax. Between them  these five countries had more than enough votes in the weighted voting system used in EC ministers' meetings to block a decision  Jopling said."
"2","The dollar closed lower on selling byspeculators and by institutional investors hedging currency risks  dealers said. But the dollar's downward potential was limited by persistent Bank of Japan intervention throughout the day. Some dealers started to sell dollars on speculation that the Group of Seven meeting expected tomorrow in Washington is unlikely to produce any significant new measures to stabilize currencies  some dealers said. The dollar closed at 145.25 yen against 145.85/90 in New York and 146.00 at the close here yesterday. The dollar ended at 1.8205/15 marks against 1.8260/70 in New York.  The market consensus is that the G-7 meeting is unlikely to change present underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar and is likely just to reaffirm the February 22 Paris accord on currency stability   a manager at a Japanese bank said. The dollar decline seem to come to a halt near 145.00 yen after the Tokyo closing on shortcovering as many operators seem unwilling to hold large positions ahead of the G-7 meeting  some dealers said.

The market is closely watching for a probable meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa later today ahead of the G-7 meeting  dealers said. Some dealers said mere reaffirmation of the Paris accord would fail to stop the dollar's decline against the yen unless the U.S. And Japan make progress in resolving trade and other economic friction. Japan is expected to explain to the U.S. The guidelines of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's economic package to stimulate domestic demand  a senior party official said. Operators generally see the dollar as still likely to head downwards  probably sliding as low as 140.00 yen  despite the G-7 meeting  dealers said.

The firm tone of the pound is expected to remain for the time being due to bullish sentiment  mainly on speculation the ruling Conservative Party would retain power in expected general elections  although the Bank of England may intervene in the market  some dealers said. The Bank of Japan stepped into the market soon after the opening and continued to intervene in the market to buy dollars on a small-lot basis all day  dealers said.

"2","The dollar opened easier in quiettrading and should stay firmly entrenched in its established range ahead of this week's round of international finance meetings  dealers said.  There is little turnover  no new ideas or impulses   a dealer at a U.S. Bank said.  It promises to be a boring day.  He said the dollar's range was expected to be 1.8075 to 1.8250 marks in the run-up to the International Monetary Fund forum. The mark eased against some currencies on speculation call money rates could fall further. Despite this  the dollar opened lower at 1.8200/15 marks after yesterday's 1.8260/70.

Money market dealers said funds may be allocated at lower than the 3.80 pct the bank has set since its monetary package at the end of January  softening the mark's undertone. Sterling opened at 2.951/955 marks  just under yesterday's closing 2.954/958  and was seen firming further against major currencies on a wave of popularity for British prime minsiter Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservatives.  Sterling is looking very healthy at the moment   one dealer said  adding that Japanese security houses bought pounds at the start of trading. Dealers said the pound was also supported by an improved British economic outlook and stability in the oil market. The Swiss franc continued to firm against the mark as investors took advantage of the interest rate differential. It opened higher at 120.25/40 marks per 100 after yesterday's last 120.10/25. The yen strengthened to open at 1.2520/2540 marks per 100 from yesterday's last 1.2490/2510 and the French franc was unchanged at yesterday's last 30.04/07 marks per 100. The Belgian franc was stable at 4.828/830 marks per 100. The Danish crown started at 26.48/51 marks per 100  little changed from yesterday's closing 26.49/51. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from late yesterday  with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-9/16 pct. Six-month euromarks were stable at midpoint 3-7/8 pct."
"2","The U.S. Dollar closed lower after aday of thin trading as most operators were sidelined ahead of the International Monetary Funds meeting in Washington this week  dealers said. They noted the Group of Seven industrialised nations is expected to meet and discuss currency movements during the course of the IMF gathering. But some speculative selling of the dollar was noted on conviction that the Bank of Japan will intervene less during of the meetings. The dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90. Dealers said  however  the Japanese central bank bought dollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar's falls. The U.S. Unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early 1.8230/40 and New York's 1.8260/70 close. It was under pressure also because most traders anticipated the currency meeting to bring little surprise  dealers said. Sterling advanced to 1.6200/10 dlrs from an early 1.6185/95 and New York's final 1.6175/85 on rising support to the ruling Conservative Party of Britain  dealers said. They said the pound gained ground on belief that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will call an early general election in June. But chartists said they expect strong resistance around 1.62 dlrs. Elsewhere the dollar fell to 1.5137/47 Swiss francs from New York's final 1.5180/90 and was lower at 6.0600/20 French francs against 6.0745/75. Asian dollar deposits were lower with the three months settling at 6-1/2 3/8 pct against Friday's close of 6-11/16 9/16 and the six months eased to 6-5/8 1/2 pct from 6-3/4 5/8. The Hong Kong dollar stayed on the weak side of its 7.80 peg with the U.S. Unit  finishing at 7.8015/35 against Friday's close here of 7.8005/25. Interbank rates were firmer following the local banks' move to raise prime rates by half-point to 6-1/2 pct  effective today  dealers said. The overnight rose to 4-1/2 1/4 pct from Friday's close of four 3-1/2  while the three months was unchanged at 5-1/4 1/16 pct."
"2","Shares prices were mostly higher at theoustset  bouyed by the latest opinion polls  one of which shows the ruling Conservative party having a 13 point lead over the Labour opposition party. Record closes on both the New york and Tokyo stock exchanges supported market sentiment. Dealers expect the market to open around five to eight points higher but then ease back should buying support fail to emerge. The market appears fairly convinced of a Conservative win in the next general election but is likely to be restrained by uncertainty over its timing. Unilever rose 18p to 2 589 and British Telecom 2p to 254."
"2","The Australian dollar staged a strongrecovery on the local market after sharp overnight falls offshore  as a weak U.S. Dollar and capital inflow into local gold stocks and securities boosted demand  dealers said. The dollar closed at 0.7092/97 U.S. Dlrs  after opening easier at 0.7040/45 from U.S. Lows of 0.7030/40. But the dollar still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of 0.7109/14. Traders are confident the local unit will return above 0.7100  and they regard today's fall as a correction in the currency's recent uptrend. Traders said the Australian dollar  after trading around 0.7040/50 for most of the day  surged to its day's high in late afternoon trading on Asian buying. They said offshore traders are still bullish towards the Australian dollar as yesterday's U.S. Selling occurred in thin volume. Nervousness over the short-term direction of the U.S. Dollar ahead of the International Monetary Fund meeting also provided support for the Australian dollar. In Asia  the U.S. Dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90. The U.S. Dollar also finished at 1.8208/18 marks against Tokyo's 1.8205/15 and 1.8260/70 in New York. The Reserve Bank trade weighted index eased to 55.7 points from yesterday's 56.0. The U.S. Dollar average hedge settlement rate was struck at 70.66 from 71.10."
"2","Eurodollar deposit rates were littlechanged at midsession though some firmness was detected at the longer end of the market prompted by a slightly weaker dollar. Dealers said the market remains extremely thin with no important U.S. Economic indicators due until Friday. Operators are awaiting the outcome of the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Washington tomorrow to review their February accord on currency stability. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's testimony before a Senate subcommittee later today on monetary policy could provide some interest  dealers added. Short dated eurodollars were steady with overnight to spot/next quoted at a common 6-1/4 1/8. One week gained 1/16 point to 6-5/16 3/16 pct. In the period rates  one to five months were unchanged with three months at 6-9/16 7/16 pct. Six months to one year were all 1/16 point firmer with sixes at 6-11/16 9/16 pct and one year at 6-7/8 3/4 pct."
"2","Equities steadied near the day's lows atmidsession after a hesistant start mainly due to lack of interest in quiet trading conditions. Dealers said most of the trading appeared to be inter-professional  highlighting the market's cautious approach in the wake of yesterday's strong performance. The latest opinion polls strengthened the market's conviction that the Conservatives will win the next general election  but the uncertainty over the date continues to provide an unsettling factor. At 1141 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 10.6 down at 1.979.0. In a poll conducted for television programme TV-AM showed the Conservative Party 13 points ahead of the Oppsition Labour Party. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today  which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats  gave the Conservative party a lead of six points over Labour. Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan  although less pronounced  provides a further note of caution  dealers said. Yesterday the Japanese finance ministry said it will help expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate foreign membership. The lack of enthusiasm for shares this morning despite gains to record territory on both the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges further underlined market nervousness. ICI fell a penny at 1 334  Glaxo 8p at 1 480  Beecham 12p at 521  BPB 10p to 660 and P and O 3p to 617. Wellcome shed 23p to 397 on profittaking after adverse press comment on the side effects of its  Retrovir  aids drug  dealers said. London International  makers of condoms  gained 14p at 302 in contrast. Among few other gains Jaguar rose 12p to 587 mainly on U.S demand  dealers said  Unilever added 8p at 2 578  Plessey 2p to 243  as did Reuter at 701p. In lower oils BP shed 13p at 907p after news yesterday Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not already own. Shell lost 10p at 1 223. Banks mostly showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503 as did Natwest at 588. Standard Chartered lost 4p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds was one penny higher at 488. Extel further declined today  losing 28p to 462 in the wake of news yesterday British Printing and Communications Corp and its associates said they would not be making a bid for the company. In mixed insurances Sun Life gained 7p at 1 085  Prudential Corp rose a penny  at 833 while Royal declined 4p to 945 as did Sun Alliance at 828. The market now awaits Wall Street's opening  which is expected mixed to higher  for further direction. At 1151 GMT the FTSE 100 share index was eight points down at 1 981.0  lifted by some selected bargain-hunting after touching 1978.7 earlier."
"2","After a few days of volatility  thecredit markets show signs of settling back into the frustratingly narrow ranges that prevailed for much of the first quarter  economists said. Friday's weak employment data for March braked an ascent in bond yields before the 30-year yield could reach the psychologically important eight pct level. But  with question marks hanging over the strength of the economy and  more critically  the value of the dollar  economists said the market remains fragile and will not quickly recoup the ground lost in the past two weeks. The 30-year bond yield closed Monday at 7.84 pct  down from 7.86 pct on Friday and a 12-month high last week of 7.93 pct  but trading was lackluster.  People are sitting on the fence  they don't really know what to do   said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.  Our retail accounts are not committing themselves either way.  No economic indicators are due today  but the markets will hear Congressional testimony from Fed chairman Paul Volcker at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT) and will be alert for the possibility of another outright purchase of securities by the Fed. The Fed needs to buy a large volume of securities at this time of year to offset the reserve drain caused by a build-up of Treasury funds at the Fed around the April 15 tax date. The Fed confounded most economists' predictions of a bill  pass  last week by buying instead a record 2.2 billion dlrs of notes and bonds  and Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the Fed could make it two in a row by offering to buy coupon securities today or Wednesday. The Fed will not buy bills since they are already in relatively short supply after heavy Treasury paydowns in recent weeks  she argued.  They haven't paid down so many bills before in a quarter   Ramirez said  noting that the Treasury has been able to reduce the size of its regular bill auctions because of strong tax revenues following the reform of the tax code at the beginning of the year. Because it would be unprecedented for the Fed to conduct back-to-back coupon  passes   most economists still expect the Fed to buy bills this week instead of bonds and notes. After trading late yesterday at 6-1/8 pct  Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open at 6-1/8  6-1/4 pct."
"2","The International Cocoa Organization buffer stockcould face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins operations in the next few weeks  cocoa traders said. They believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75 000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly. (XYZS 1019) Cocoa futures were about unchanged from last night by midmorning. Sterling's strength together with continued availability of West African new crop physical offerings more than outweighed any bullish impact from last night's higher New York market  dealers said. (CKLB) LONDON - Dry cargo futures on BIFFEX dropped sharply in morning trading as further profittaking emerged after the recent rise in values  dealers said.

"2","The dollar opened lower following thetrend set earlier in the Far East and Europe  dealers said. Still  the U.S. currency remained well within recent trading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out on a limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington. The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism that this week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measures to stabilise currencies. But whatever their opinions  U.S. dealers remained cautious of selling the dollar aggressively. The dollar opened at 145.10/20 yen  down from 145.85/90. The dollar's decline occurred despite renewed Bank of Japan intervention on its behalf in Tokyo  dealers noted. Dealers in Japan said the central bank bought dollars steadily for yen during Tokyo hours.  There were some large sell-orders in Tokyo  but apparently it wasn't too hectic   said a dealer at one major U.S. bank.  The tone still is very cautious ahead of the Washington meetings.  The dollar also opened at 1.8220/30 marks  down from 1.8260/70 at last night's close  and at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs  down from 1.5180/90. Meanwhile  sterling prolonged its advance with the aid of more public opinion polls indicating the ruling Conservative party would retain power with a large majority in any general election. Sterling rose to 1.6186/91 dlrs  from 1.6175/85 on Monday  but eased slightly to about 2.953 marks from 2.955. Dealers did not detect any U.K. intervention to subdue the pound today. Some said the U.K. central bank may have bought dollars for yen in Europe  but this could not be confirmed. The dollar eased to 1.3071/76 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday  showing limited response to president Reagan's endorsement of efforts for U.S./Canada free trade."
"2","Traders expect U.S. energy futures willopen higher  tracking firmer gasoil futures and cash crude markets. Also lending support  said traders  are reports that the Iran/Iraq war is heating up. Crude futures are called five to 10 cts higher with support from a squeeze in the April 15-day forward Brent crude market  which traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today  and from domestic grades  trading unchanged to seven cts higher  traders said. Iraq said today it attacked Iran's Sirri Island as well as offshore oil escalations west of Kharg Island. Iran meanwhile reported victories on the southern front in its war with Iraq. These reports may support the market  which is  begging for news   said one broker. He said resistance is at 18.75-18.85 dlrs  then 19.00 dlrs a barrel for May crude. Products are called 0.25-0.50 cent higher a gallon following gasoil futures which ended the morning session 1.25 dlrs higher a tonne basis April  which expired today  and 1.00 dlr higher basis May  traders said."
"2","U.S. interest rate futures were lower inquiet early activity. A weak dollar pressured debt futures. Remarks made yesterday by Council of Economic Advisers Beryl Sprinkel that the U.S. has no target value for the dollar continued to impact the market  traders said. The market awaited action by finance ministers of the G-5 nations  who are to meet today. Pending any action that would strengthen the dollar  June Treasury bonds were expected to remain below chart resistance at 98-16/32  traders said. Chart support was cited at 97-23/32 on a day-trading basis and at 97-3/32 on a longer-term basis. At 0950 EDT  CBT T-bonds ranged from down 16/32 to 11/32 point  T-notes fell 10/32 to 11/32 and muni bonds were down 9/32 point. IMM T-bills were 3 to 5 basis points lower and Eurodollars fell 4 to 7 basis points."
"2","CBT soybean futures were expected toopen steady  possibly easier on a disappointing weekly soybean export figure below the previous week and year ago levels and moderate country movement overnight  traders said. The outlook for increased Brazilian harvest pressure later this month and the settlement of the Brazilian seamen strike will add to the negative sentiment in old crop. ---- Brazil's soybean harvest was 24 pct complete by April 3  compared with an average of 36 pct  the Safras and Mercado newsletter said  with Rio Grande do Sul 10 pct and 17 pct respectively  Parana 55 and 63 pct respectively  Mato Grosso do Sul 30 and 36 pct  Mato Grosso 10 pct and NA  Goias 10 pct and NA and other states 25/30 and 36 pct respectively."
"2","CBT wheat futures were expected to opensteady  supported by followthrough speculative buying after yesterday's strong close when new contract highs were set in new crop  traders said. However  rumors that several countries have passed on their tenders for U.S. wheat or taken wheat from other exporting countries may keep nearbys on the defensive. ---- The USDA will issue this week a swap catalogue of government-owned grain that storage-surplus elevators will be able to swap with storage-deficit locations  a senior USDA official said...Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage due to frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March  the China daily said."
"2","Money market interest rates closed littlechanged after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K. Base lending rates fizzled out  dealers said. Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party well ahead had little effect on the market with operators looking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling continued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in Washington this week. One senior money broker commented   What we want is an election date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the market knows what's happening then we can move forward.  The next move in U.K. Base rates  which now stand at 10 pct  is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date of a general election is making for cautious trading  dealers said. Yesterday  opinion polls showing the Government was set to retain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and fuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates. The British authorities are likely to remain cautious  however  as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review their February Paris accord on currency stability. This could affect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in trade weighted terms to stand at 72.3. Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the day-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of England. As rates fell yesterday  no band four bills  which have a maturity of between two and three months were transacted. Today  however  these again appeared but the majority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to two months range. The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged quoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until fresh economic or political news emerges  dealers say they expect the market to continue around these levels with only technical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates. The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the system today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite this  overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range having started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct. Period interbank rates were little changed with six months quoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct. Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine months ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct respectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from late yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three months at 9-17/32 15/32 pct."
"2","Eurodollar deposit rates closed littlechanged around the levels established at midmorning. Rates at the longer end of the market showed 1/16 point gains on a weak opening from the dollar  dealers said. Trading remained very quiet throughout the day with operators sidelined in the absence of major U.S. Economic data and ahead of this week's Group of Seven meeting in Washington. The G-7 finance ministers are due to discuss their February pact on currency stability and this could well have an impact. One to five month eurodollars were steady with three months closing at 6-9/16 7/16 pct. Dealers noted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would hit investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending. Volcker was testifying to the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said a further fall in the dollar would be counterproductive and that the currency's performance could be a factor in determining U.S. Monetary policy. Short dated eurodollars were steady with overnight to spot/next quoted at a uniform 6-1/4 1/8 pct. The Fed added temporary reserves via two-day system repurchase agreements with Fed funds trading at 6-1/8 pct."

"2","The dollar was steady ahead of a seriesof meetings of leading finance ministers starting today in Washington  despite low expectations for the outcome of the talks and still negative underlying sentiment toward the dollar.  There's too much disagreement between the Japanese and the rest for them to come out with anything unanimous   said one U.K. Merchant bank trader  reflecting the general tone. However  dealers said position squaring helped push the dollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks  up from the opening 1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55. Meanwhile  the pound was underpinned by today's opinion poll findings of further strong support for the Conservative Party  but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying. Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had needed to sell sterling to curb rises today  with the markets so quiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds yesterday. Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index  unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's finish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs  after an opening 1.6213/23 and previous close of 1.6163/73  and at 2.9490/520 marks  against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530. Traders said there was little hope that the Western financiers will be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of currency instability during the current series of talks in Washington. These are scheduled to start today with an informal Group of Five (G-5) session. Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting - of the U.S.  Japan  West Germany  France  the U.K.  Italy and Canada - is seen as the key meeting. Traders said few operators will be prepared to open positions ahead of news emerging from the talks. However  some traders said that  given the low level of expectations  the market could be particularly susceptible to signs of accord between the U.S. And Japan  which would give the dollar a sharp upward push. They said interest is still largely centred on the yen  with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that market first. Meanwhile  today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on the market. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall could be counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon  but there was little followthrough  traders said. The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen  up from an opening 145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10. It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs  against the start of 1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90  and at 6.0650/700 French francs  after beginning at 6.0525/75 and ending yesterday at 6.0660/710."

"2","OPEC's weekend decision to cut plannedoil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed market confidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the year and boosted international spot prices  oil traders said. Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrel higher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday and could continue their rise in the next few weeks  they said. The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd). At its previous meeting in December  OPEC set a provisional 16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed a sharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to back up its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was contemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling  spot prices of the most widely traded crude oil  Britain's Brent Blend  surged 30-40 cents a barrel. Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this morning in London  taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35 dlrs  compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week. Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly to news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies later in the year  when demand for oil increases with the onset of the Northern Hemisphere winter  and further rises in spot prices.  There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth quarters of this year  one trader said.  In the past three months we have already seen a rise in demand  particularly from the U.S.  And I expect to see even higher prices  he added. Mehdi Varzi  analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson in London  agreed. Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious in setting the new output ceilings.  There is now a great chance that Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next month   he said. Laurie Law  analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York  said over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the year from just over 20 dlrs now. WTI  the U.S. Benchmark crude  usually fetches a premium of 80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year  spot Brent has held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel. But some traders  fearing continued over-production by some OPEC members  sounded a note of caution over the new accord. Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement because other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand for the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq. In recent months Iraq has been producing 500 000 bpd above its assigned quota  and it could begin pumping a further 500 000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in September. According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah  actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be well above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd."

"2","European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker  who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings  were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday  they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct  and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores  to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins  and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds  a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers  all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions  maintained entrenched positions yesterday  making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in a notional common currency  are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area  saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which  while not having the status of a compromise proposal  would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle  with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns  and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically  is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for."
"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman  Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker  told a news conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks  with the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served little more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex package of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would result in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European currency units  to help the EC's cash crisis  and changes in the conversion of EC common farm prices into national currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and Dutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences between EC states on the oils tax proposal  the currency measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated measures. But he told journalists   We have used this meeting to reach the point at which real negotiations can start at the next meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our procedures took much longer than planned.  Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package by April 1 each year  although this target is seldom reached in practice. Diplomats said on all the points there were widely diverging views  with Britain and the Netherlands  the countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals price cuts  strongly opposed to the oils tax. However  de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to resolve.  This is a very tough political nut  and because of the very nature of the problem there is no technical solution   he said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his proposals to make an agreement easier. However  because of the EC's budgetary crisis  he had little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers  led by Germany's Ignaz Kiechle  are demanding. EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five billion Ecus by the end of this year  even if the commission farm price package is adopted in its entirety."
"2","Soviet farmers had sown spring cropson only 15.8 mln hectares or 11 pct of cultivated land by April 27  compared with 26.2 mln ha by April 21  1986  Izvestia said. Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha  compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year  it added. Spring sowing is off to a slow start  with planting two to four weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine  Byelorussia and Russia  because the winter was unusually cold. Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still be good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach the 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210 mln."
"2","Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30  Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens said today. Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm price package which has endured since March. Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had to be referred to heads of government. These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and vegetable fats and oils  and proposals to change the system by which EC farm prices  expressed in European currency units (Ecus)  are translated into the currencies of member states. The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S.  A major exporter of soybeans to the EC. West Germany  meanwhile  is strongly against the technical currency move  which would result in additional price cuts for farmers in countries with strong currencies  such as the mark. Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean heads of government diverting their attention from much more important world and Community issues. Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest themselves in such technically complex questions. However  Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some nuances in member state positions  which may make the dialogue more constructive in the next few weeks.  If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month  the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct cut in cereals prices  farm trade sources said. It originally proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this year  with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops. Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency reforms. The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year. Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's meeting very useful  diplomats said there was little sign of a major shift in the position of member states  or of finance ministers adopting a different line from that of their agriculture colleagues. The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their differences."

"2","Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone  alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao  although normal humidity levels have not been restored  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155 221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers  middlemen  exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1 750 to 1 780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1 850 and 1 880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july  Aug/Sept at 1 870  1 875 and 1 880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4 340  4 345 and 4 350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May  June/July at 4 400 and 4 415 dlrs  Aug/Sept at 4 351 to 4 450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4 480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec  Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S.  Covertible currency areas  Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April  785 dlrs for May  753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S.  Argentina  Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2 325 and 2 380 dlrs  June/July at 2 375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July  Aug/Sept at 2 400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec  Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27."
"2","BankAmerica Corp is not underpressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance  banking analysts said. Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering  which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. BankAmerica stock fell this week  along with other banking issues  on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. The stock traded around 12  down 1/8  this afternoon  after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone  BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.  The circumstances at the time will determine what we do   said Arthur Miller  BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications  when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.  I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could   said Lawrence Cohn  analyst with Merrill Lynch  Pierce  Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits  the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer  most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders  noted Daniel Williams  analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter  the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless  BankAmerica  which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans  stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt  and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year  said Joseph Arsenio  analyst with Birr  Wilson and Co. He noted  however  that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt  the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured  similar to way Mexico's debt was  minimizing losses to the creditor banks."

"2","Venezuela and its bank advisorycommittee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February  bankers said. They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms. The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today  the bankers said.  A number of details have still to be finalized  but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place   one senior banker said. The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates  but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987  1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela. The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks  which have been going on intermittently for several months  follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel. And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package  including a 7.7 billion dlr loan  will be signed on March 20. While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental  bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swift deals  banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil."

"2","Secretary of State GeorgeShultz acknowledged failings in the Iran arms affair but declared he would not resign. His role in the scandal that has scarred the Reagan administration attracted harsh criticism from the Tower commission in its report on the affair published today. Shultz  travelling to China for a week-long visit  refused to comment directly on the report  published after he had left Washington. But he repeated -- as he has done since the crisis broke last November -- that he was not going to resign.  You can wipe that off your slate   he said."
"2","Argentina could suspend payments onits foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets  ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.  Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country   he added. Baglini  an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks  told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request. Baglini said that as a result  today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed. He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil  which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt. Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth  which has been targeted at four pct in 1987  Baglini said.  Debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets  that is their commercial balance  to meet interest payments   he added."
"2","Iran announced tonight that its majoroffensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the Baghdad government. The Iranian news agency IRNA  in a report received in London  said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over. It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had  dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war.  The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq.  The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...   said the statement quoted by IRNA. It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to  come to their senses  and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq. Iran said its forces had  liberated  155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands  townships  rivers and part of a road leading into Basra. The Iranian forces  are in full control of these areas   the statement said. It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed  along with 700 tanks and 1 500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed  250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers."
"2","A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays  administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments  a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)  former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report  which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash  is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates  said the GAO source  depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures  then the net cost of the program would go up. However  if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease  the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded  the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates  will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program   an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program  while USDA remains firmly committed to it."
"2","venezuela is seeking a 'constructive andflexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt  finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say   they are progressing.  Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments  but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today  which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor  azpurua said only   that is good news.  According to banking sources  the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants. Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction  deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988  lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule  and debt capitalization schemes. Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling  and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal  both public sector. He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year  but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year  but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans.  debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed   azpurua said. However  he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments   because circumstances change too quickly.  At the same time  he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt  based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank."
"2","OPEC may be forced to meet before ascheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices  oil industry analysts said.  The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems   said Daniel Yergin  director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.  OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way   said Paul Mlotok  oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.  OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas  fixed prices and set differentials   said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named.  The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again   he added. David T. Mizrahi  editor of Mideast reports  expects OPEC to meet before June  although not immediately. However  he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.  They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil  but in late March and April when demand slackens   Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.  Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.  OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then   said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.  Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production   he told Reuters in a telephone interview."
"2","The Tower Commission's scathingcomments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure  but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November. But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger  who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it  had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.  Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or  if they could not in conscience do that  to so inform the president   the report said after a three-month probe.  Instead  they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.  The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan  a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and  perhaps more importantly  Reagan's wife Nancy.  More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory  he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser   said the report. Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission's findings next week. With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office  the report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole  a key Reagan ally  told reporters the report disclosed  colossal blunders  and said people who had not served the president well should step aside  but he did not specify who should go.  It would seem to me that if you don't protect the president  you don't serve the president well  then you should move on   the Kansas Republican  a likely presidential candidate next year  said. One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future."
"2","Japan has pledged to try to increaseits purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases  the Commerce Department said. U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade. Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases  a Commerce department official said. He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders. The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that  statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers.  It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985  U.S. firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market."

The result is expected to play a key role in determining when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  leader of the ruling Conservatives  might call a general election."
"2","Japanese life insurers  trust banks andcorporations  largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years  are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S.  Britain  France and Hong Kong  fund managers said. After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years  Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments  they said. Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986  Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd  said. Matsumoto  who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy  said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year  but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs  he added. This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets  Matsumoto said.  The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market  first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years   said Eugene Atkinson  managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity  enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk  he added. However  few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay  fund managers said. Institutions  particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders  are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries  but will put in less money  said Shinichi Kobuse  manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities. There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors  but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive  he added. Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations  he added. Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies  which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities  hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S.  But will now invest in Britain  West Germany  France and other countries  Hashimoto said. Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen  the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks  he added. One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds  he said. Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase  said Andrew Sheaf  general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan.  Last week was the busiest week we had   he said. Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms  fund managers said. Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest  but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc  they said. Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability  they added. Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany  particularly as German firms  like their Japanese counterparts  are concerned about the recent dollar fall. Australia also poses some risks due to currency values  they added."
"2","Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris  Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law  which should be approved by parliament on March 3  abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses  they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank  People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates  the sources said. However  it was impossible for them to follow the last cut  to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28  because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy  they said. On Tuesday  the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct  effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau  the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare  the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate  the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds  minus 0.1 percentage points  is the likeliest choice  they added."
"2","Japan's ruling and opposition partiesagreed to reopen talks on the budget for the fiscal year ending March 31 1988 when the Lower House Budget Committee meets next Tuesday  a parliamentary official said. He said officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties agreed at a meeting of the committee's board of directors. Strong opposition objection to government tax reform proposals including a controversial sales tax has delayed deliberation by the Lower House Budget Committee."
"2","Domestic demand is now expected to makeno contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87  ending June 30  while net exports will account for all of the overall increase  Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However  he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.  The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower  around 14 billion   he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track  Keating said.  They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time   he said.  On the other hand  net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time  and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.  Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.  Nevertheless  there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane   he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.  The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88   Keating said.  As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further  and given continued effective wage restraint  inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88   he said."
"2","The Philippines will offer its commercialbank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative to cash  the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said   It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.  Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country s 12-bank advisory committee  Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines  debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.  (The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative   Ongpin said.  Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund  the (World) Bank  the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received.   We don t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side   Ongpin said.  We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."
"2","Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today  with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However  delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme  delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers  want to have the ball only in their court and it isn t fair   minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1  using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares  with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30  delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo  allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market  Colombia 17 pct  Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct  with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability  using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share  and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share  delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package.  Anything is possible at this phase   even adjournment of the meeting until March or April  one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas  the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result  industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled  so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either  they said."
"2","Britain s ruling Conservatives haveenlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party  according to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday. A Market &amp; Opinion Research International (MORI) poll conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a six point lead  while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead. The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of Greenwich  near London. The MORI poll  conducted in the six days leading up to the by-election  showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote  Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and Liberals with 21 pct. The Sunday Express said its poll  conducted on Friday  found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote  Labour with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct. A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over Labour. In that survey  the Conservatives had the support of 39 pct of the voters  Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct."
"2","Kuwait s Oil Minister  in remarkspublished today  said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying:  None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.  He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948 000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Kuwait  they said  was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.  This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability  it will do so   the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.  If we can sell more than our quota at official prices  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share  it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever   he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar  which industry sources said was selling less than 180 000 bpd of its 285 000 bpd quota  because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered  a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.  Because it was charging its official price  of 16.67 dlrs a barrel  it had lost custom  he said but did not elaborate. However  Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad  he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body s members. Ecuador s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude  and was to seek this at talks this month of opec s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members  in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar  he said:  We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.  But he expected the situation would later improve."
"2","Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy  the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues  the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia  the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer  has been severely hit by last year s fall in world oil prices  which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.  (It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation  both as it pertains to investments and imports   the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia s agricultural sector  but also reviews the country s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation   there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.   This group strongly favours an import substitution economy   the report says. Indonesia s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected  and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May  which broadened areas for foreign investment  reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero  and the economy may even have contracted a bit.  This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s   the report notes. Indonesia  the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million  is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook.  For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.   Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity  real declines in construction and trade  and a reduced level of growth in agriculture   the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform  the Bank said."

"2","Saudi riyal interbank deposits weresteady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market. Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices. Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation. A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity. Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4  5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven  six yesterday. One  three  and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8  3/8  7-1/8  6-7/8 and 7-3/8  1/8 pct respectively.

"2","The Gulf oil state of Qatar  recoveringslightly from last year's decline in world oil prices  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today  Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals  down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings  social services  health  education  transport and communications  electricity and water  industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar  an OPEC member  has an output ceiling of 285 000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said:  Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends  foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth  have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."
"2","Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade  but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind  &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate  foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.  Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts   he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets  stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.  Nevertheless  bond and stock markets remain  to a large extent  fragmented and lagging behind   he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange  while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf  governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges  Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had  clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.  In addition  family firms are reluctant to go public  financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain  Kuwait  Qatar  Oman  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction  with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is  no bond market to speak of  in Saudi Arabia  Qatar  Oman or the UAE  with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up  establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar  Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent  Azzam said."
"2","Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerreiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market  the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices  Nazer said Saudi Arabia  is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.  Nazer  quoted by SPA  said recent pressure on free market prices  may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.  Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord  under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets  which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica  OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman  who is also Nigerian Oil Minister  said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.  We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market  but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions   he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister  Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah  said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  along with the much smaller producer Ecuador  among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing."
"2","The International Coffee Organization(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night  but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. The special meeting  called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices  was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement  delegates said. The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September  they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system  delegates said. Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter."

"2","Zambia will retain its foreign-exchangeauction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24  President Kenneth Kaunda said.  We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all   he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and  he hoped  would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector  he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders  and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar."

Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for Poland's difficult economic position   PAP quoted Baka as saying. Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial obligations to the U.S.   but not in a short time  and not without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.  Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June  after a 36-year absence  IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. A major report is expected to be issued in Washington soon. Poland has said it will not be able to meet interest repayments and debt principle falling due this year."
"2","Indonesia's raw sugar output is likelyto be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987  unchanged from 1986 and below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln  the U.S. Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987. Indonesia bought 162 500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986  the report said. The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes  against a government estimate of 1.99 mln. It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived. The report said   The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers.  However  there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops."

"2","European Community (EC) agricultureministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers  Community officials said. The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's Brussels Commission  which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses  which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy  demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals  over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil  Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year  an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices  coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms  which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the  green  exchange rate system  which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax  of up to 330 Ecus per tonne  would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds  but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States  which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes  which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line."
"2","An earthquake measuring 6.5 on theRichter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas  officials and seismologists said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas. The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated. A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16 000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged. No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip. Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes  the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks. The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island. Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week. Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links. Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam  32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina  the largest earth dam in the North Island."
"2","Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpinstarts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory committee in New York tomorrow  buoyed by an economy on the mend and political stability one year after President Corazon Aquino took power  central bank officials said. The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs  rescheduled in a 1985 accord  to any new agreement  the officials said. Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the Philippines  despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week  the officials said. Manila  which has not made any principal repayments since 1983  wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue. Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate  which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct. The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7. Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments. One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type accord  which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing to endorse five months after it was signed. In Manila's case  about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks on the advisory committee  while about 180 smaller banks have average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each."

In January  the nation's foreign reserves showed the largest-ever monthly increase at 9.22 billion dlrs due to massive Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention during the month as the dollar fell briefly to an all-time low of 149.98 yen on January 19  foreign exchange dealers said."

Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world oil prices. Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last September it could not meet the remaining four principal repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs  and missed the first of these for 71.25 mln due on September 29. The 500 mln dlr credit  under the lead management of Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF)  has a five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not deferred. One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of the accord  expected in late March  with the remainder in three more instalments to be made every six months. The remaining three principal instalments - originally due in March 1987  September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be deferred for two years from the due date  banking sources said. The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty interest is being imposed  the sources added. Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one of resignation  with many bankers seeing little alternative for Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs  although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies  particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit  a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank  was signed in October  1985 and is still in a two year grace period. The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing. But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit."

An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine new ideas  and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt  they said. The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombia to salvage the talks  which by late yesterday looked perilously close to ending without agreement on quotas  delegates said."
"2","Japanese securities houses will issue newcorporate bonds more quickly  accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1  to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market  securities managers said. Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash  but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues  they said.  Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds  but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds  to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets   a Nikko Securities house bond manager said. Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now  the securities managers said. Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system  in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end  and accept issue requests during the month  they said. Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market  securities managers said. Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April  with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>. The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms  securities sources said. The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds. Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic  they said. The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market  securities house managers said. The finance ministry  commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1  securities managers said. The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now  securities managers said. The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system  more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process  securities sources said. It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system  which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds  and for deregulation of private placements  they said. Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect  the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law  expected in 1988  the sources said."
"2","The start of trading on the newSingapore Government Securities Market has been postponed until late March or early April because legislative amendments still need parliamentary approval  banking sources said. The new bill market  intended to establish a base for a wider capital market and to encourage private bond issues in Singapore  was supposed to be launched today. William K.K. Wong  managing director of Indosuez Asia (Singapore) Ltd  said there is no real obstacle to prevent the new market from taking off. Most dealers are optimistic it will provide more liquidity for operators to trade  he said. Lawrence Yeo  director of Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd  said the market's success depends on domestic participation. The five primary dealers and the three registered dealers will all be local companies. The primary dealers are &lt;Commercial Discount Co Ltd>  &lt;National Discount Co Ltd>  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd &lt;OCBM.SI>  &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd> and United Overseas Bank Ltd &lt;UOBM.SI>. They will underwrite the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) auctions  maintain market liquidity and channel open-market operations  MAS said. &lt;Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd>  &lt;Indosuez Asia (Singapore) Ltd> and &lt;Credit Suisse First Boston Asia Ltd> will be recognised as registered dealers. They will act as market makers but will not bid directly at auctions. MAS plans to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38 billion dlrs of paper over the first five years. Non-competitive bids from primary dealers prepared to accept average yield will be allocated first  to a maximum 500 000 dlrs for notes and bonds and to an unlimited amount for treasury bills. The remaining amount will be awarded to competitive bidders from the lowest yield upwards. In the secondary market  the standard lot traded between dealers will be one mln dlrs worth of treasury bills and 500 000 dlrs worth of government notes and bonds."
"2","Japanese banks are expected to giveNigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks  banking sources said.  We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling   said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank. A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt  bankers said. The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans.  The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation   said another Japanese bank official. He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details. Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria  representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions  banking sources said. They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here  the sources added.  Otherwise  our response will be very negative   the senior official said. Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal. Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems. Barclays Bank plc &lt;BCS.L> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem  the banking sources said. BankAmerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far East and representing them on the committee  they added."
"2","Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likelyto leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package  political analysts said. They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988.  Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration  which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican   Rei Shiratori  professor of politics at Dokkyo University  told Reuters.  Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax  probably in the summer   Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax  which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax.  There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies   he told a meeting of government and party leaders.  If the party discipline is broken  I would like to see punishment considered.   A proposed sales tax has become a political issue  partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it   Shiratori said.  Moreover  the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging   he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2 500 local elections scheduled for April  involving governors  mayors  town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated  since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP  the political analysts added. Shiratori said   In the worst case  implementation of the sales tax  now scheduled for next January  may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision.  Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct.  A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs   he said. Seizaburo Sato  professor of politics at Tokyo University  thought the last possibility most likely.  I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills   he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House. To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills  the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign  Sato said.  Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed   he said."
"2","Thousands of blackmineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa's gold  uranium  platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers. About 15 000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200 000 strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations. Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines. It was not stated how the union would  seize control.  The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex hostels for migrant workers  to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families. The crowd  one of the largest to attend a meeting since South Africa declared a state of emergency last June  also shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela be released."

"2","The combined profits of Japan's majorcorporations  excluding financial institutions  are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31  compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November  Wako Research Institute of Economics said. The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1 084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November. Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct  it said. Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook  the institute said. It said lower interest rates  which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs  are also behind the improved performance outlook. Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses  it said. The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88."

Gemayel had agreed to the proposals in two months of indirect negotiations with Syrian leaders  the sources said."
"2","Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty  economists  politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88  ending March  is 56.88 billion rupees  down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87  based on wholesale prices  is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday  Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure  he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani  president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party  said Gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy  as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply  may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects  after bad weather last year  may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88  up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes  which will discourage savings  economists said. Avinash Purulkar  chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India  said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said   There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure.  But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene.  Just now there is acute nervousness in the market   he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues  both convertible and non-convertible  rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85."

The company's foreign debt  mainly from the Japanese and U.S. Banks  was cut nearly by half to 66.2 billion taiwan dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 124.6 billion in 1985  he said. Its domestic borrowings however rose to 105.2 billion taiwan dlrs from 80.6 billion in the same period  he added. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now stood at 50 billion U.S. Dlrs  due to its 1986 record trade surplus of 15.6 billion."

"2","Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks  held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations  will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus  U.S. Officials said.  We appreciate their frustration   a senior Japanese government official said.  But we are also frustrated.  The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard  forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade  but it will  he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.  It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments   a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance  which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days  the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing  and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government  which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports  as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices.  It condemns Japan without due process   one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen  he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill  particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S.  Officials said. Nevertheless  Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position  especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.  We have no leverage   one official admitted. As a result  Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields  including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers  officials said."
"2","The European Community Commission saidit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices. The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint  Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers  forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses  it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs. The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority."
"2","The Philippines will offer commercialbank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash  the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said   It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.  Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country's 12-bank advisory committee  Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.  (The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative   Ongpin said.  Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund  the (World) Bank  the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received.   We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side   Ongpin said.  We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."
"2","Argentina's chief debt negotiatorsaid he was confident of a prompt accord with international creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.  I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and quick negotiation   Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world financial officials. Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit. Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable  but Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt. He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to meet the targets  adding that the banks' attitude had improved following Brazil's decision. The United States and a group of other industrial nations on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan.

"2","A rift has occured among Philippineofficials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement. Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs.  He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted   Monsod said. Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period. Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Monsod said    Right now we are saying to the banks  let's share the financing burden.  Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap. He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis. He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility. Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.  Secretary Monsod and I get along famously   he said.  She talks and I listen but I don't necessarily agree.  Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates  the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years.  If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?  she said  adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.  It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets   Monsod said.  Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day   she said. Monsod  the government's chief economic planner  stressed Manila's policy was growth before debt. She said if the banks refused to lend the new money  the Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing all debt repayments.  If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad  then of course you have an option   Monsod said.  You just don't send it abroad. You do a Brazil."

"2","Taiwan plans another round of deep tariffcuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.  A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming  vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development  told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1 700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.  We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially   he said. The United States  Taiwan's main trading partner  has said the island's import tariffs  still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct  were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs  which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas  particularly for shoes  textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord  Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

They said consumption would increase due to a rise in demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and exported 157 mln. The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year compared with 3.86 mln last year  cotton traders said. The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales last year."
"2","After a week that left his presidencyshaken and his popularity at a new low  Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal. Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker  whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise  will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon. Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates  a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat  would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote  Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said. Appearing on the NBC News program   Meet the Press   the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination  could be in some difficulty.  Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority by Baker. Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal  lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and  even if won  would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair.  He has the smell of Iran on him   said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt.  He is a victim.  Laxalt  appearing on the ABC News program   This Week With David Brinkley   bluntly admitted  the Gates nomination is in trouble.  Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates. When asked on the syndicated television program   John McLaughlin: One on One   if he thought Gates would be confirmed  the Georgia Democrat shot back:  I wouldn't bet any money on it.  I think this report hurts that   Nunn said.  It indicates that the National Security Council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with Mr. Gates. Only a day after it was issued last week  the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff. Regan  the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years  was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale. The report blamed Regan for the  chaos that descended on the White House  since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two  pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal  have refused to testify. Reagan  who freely admits disliking details  is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership  a record low  and a third believed he should consider resignation. After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower  Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency."
"2","Coffee quota talks at the InternationalCoffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon  but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas  delegates said. The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically  with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future  they said. Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time.  Anything could happen   one delegate said."
"2","Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt  Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks  he said  adding  This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.  The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983  however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S.  Japanese and European banks  Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis   Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors   central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks  followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions  worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain  France  West Germany  Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans  giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus  its chief means of servicing its foreign debt  started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt.  What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service  because we cannot service all that   he said.  I really think we have to change the old rules.  Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments  rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis  Funaro said  We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks  because the banks have some limits.   It is a political discussion from our point of view   he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks  If I've got some solution from the governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks.  He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982.  You must open these mechanisms   he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments  they understood Brazil had no other choice  as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed  because we can't stay as we were the last few years.   I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.  he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy  Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year  against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world  Funaro said  although its share of international trade was only one pct.   The solution is linked with growth  not recession   he said  noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments  as opposed to commercial banks  now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt."
"2","World animal health experts called for acampaign to eradicate the lethal cattle disease Rinderpest in Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Nepal and Pakistan  a statement from a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) meeting here said. Some 230 mln dlrs is needed over two years to vaccinate the entire susceptible cattle population in Bangladesh and Pakistan and high-risk areas of the other three countries. In India some 240 mln cattle are estimated to be at risk from the disease. The experts recommended the campaign be funded mostly by the governments of the five nations  with help from the FAO. Similar campaigns are needed in Egypt  Yemen  Iraq and Iran."
"2","U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves  a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support. Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. Funaro  accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros  is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy  arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium  because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view.  Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis  describing the meeting as an initial contact. He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request. After travelling this week to France  Germany  Switzerland and Italy  Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks."
"2","The Canadian government is expectedto announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers  U.S. government and farm group representatives said. The deadline for a final determination is March 7. U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case  Canada decided pasta imports  which take about ten pct of the Canadian market  did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market. Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986  but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated."
"2","Dutch port and transport union  FNV agreed to an employers' request to reconvene abandoned peace talks tonight to try to end strikes that have disrupted Rotterdam's general cargo sector for the past six weeks  a union spokesman said. Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which started January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800 from the sector's 4 000 workforce  starting with 350 this year. The employers' invitation to restart the talks comes on the day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf for a resolution of the dispute expires. De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the sector. No comment was immediately available from the employers' organization."
"2","European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market  which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of  manifest crisis.  But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries  with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead  in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures  they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a  voluntary  basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area  that of hot rolled coils  and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program  particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240 000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes."
"2","Talks at the extended special meeting ofthe International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued  but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge  delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September  with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year  they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord  other delegates said. No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today  delegates said. A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report  delegates said."
"2","Currency fluctuations may reassert theirinfluence on the bullion market in the near future  bullion bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report. But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.  OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices remains a worrying factor however  and on balance it appears that the market should be approached cautiously   Montagu said. The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar."
"2","Canada's decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence  a public policy study group said  It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period  when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world   the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries  the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks  with a deadline of October for an agreement  are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said  in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement  fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.  But at the same time  it added  Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks  Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking  insurance  telecommunications  and the so-called  cultural industries  - publishing  broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation   acid rain  and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage."
"2","Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaroflatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters  Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris  he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago  put Brazil in a very big recession.   We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF   he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks  the statement  which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands  said.  That was not my impression of the meeting   Funaro said;  But if the (British) answer is more or less like this  then that means nothing is helping to find a solution.  Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies  rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.  Since 1982  all official agencies have been closed to my country   he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington  Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved  Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.  We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme   he said   We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens.  Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies  which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year.  Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort   he said.  What we have to offer is our cooperation."
"2","All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed  two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions   but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions  on world grain trade  the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers  NAWG  and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities  a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved  and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be  the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals  which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and  quarantine  U.S. wheat stocks  would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers  they said. Other countries  including Australia  have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs  the organizations said.  We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers   Jim Miller  president of NAWG said.  We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture   Miller said."

Weinberger also is providing for some family members of financially-pressed troops to fly home from West Germany  Japan  Italy and Spain on military transports if they desire.

"2","Efforts to break an impasse betweencoffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to have failed  senior delegates said after a contact group meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.

"2","Greece  responding to a warning by Turkeyagainst conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea  said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area. A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week. Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens. The Greek statement today said   Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government.   The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey   it said. The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the continental shelf issue before international courts."
"2","A special meeting of the InternationalCoffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas  ICO delegates said. Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous  often heated talks  delegates said. Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds. Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting."
"2","French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year  the same rate as last year  unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988  from its present 10.9 pct  it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was  increasingly ill-adapted to demand  selling goods at  uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.   France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months   it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986  it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to  a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.  This could result in further major losses of market share  particularly in the non-OECD area  which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports  it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved  the authorities would have  little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre  even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly   it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands  contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next  the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year  the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987  and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices  caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.  We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises  and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost   one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report  indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct  against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year  with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area  the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival  West Germany  could fall to just one pct this year  it said. On the other hand  the report noted  consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.  For the disinflationary process to continue   and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability  it is essential that wage restraint continue   it said."
"2","Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker  a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal  will serve a third term  sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment  which must be filled this August  has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan  who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement  was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker  first appointed in 1979 by President Carter  will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration  Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker  kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay  the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story  quickly shot down by others in the administration  that Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the council of economic advisers  had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire  it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican  Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.  This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get   said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question  Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership  foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry  but recent statements by Volcker  in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation  signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw  exactly eye-to-eye  on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985  he decided to ensure a good working relationship  in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan  Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term  was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker  whose political skills undermined that ambition  and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay.  Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise   said one.  He'd have to be asked   said Stephen Axilrod  formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise  the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut  he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous  coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor  therefore  would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz  whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal  while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan  frequently an informal presidential economic adviser  New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman  and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege  Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House."
"2","Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union  while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports.  It's pure fiction   said one senior official at USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service  referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks. An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation  which he said was started by  somebody fanning the (wheat) market.  Wheat futures strengthened today  partly on the basis of the speculation. One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat  much of it before mid-year  if it was  competitively priced.  Alexander Ivlev  an official with Amtorg  a Soviet trading organization  told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer  but said that Moscow  would consider  buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced.  We don't care if it is EEP  what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices   Ivlev said.  If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat)  they should find ways to do it."

"2","The yen should stabilize at around152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year  the Bank of Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said.  Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150  at least for the rest of the year   he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia. Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election. The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar."

He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price.  We hope the weak price will be overcome  and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.  Refiners  he said  appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together."
"2","The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today  coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now  they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set  delegates said. Quotas  the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement  were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight  heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue  the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring  coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil  the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively  each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum  U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks  said in a statement after the council adjourned   A majority of producers  led by Brazil  were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.  We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market  instead of their political influence in the ICO.  Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered   Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas  not negotiate them.  Previously  quotas were determined by historical amounts exported  which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks  which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia  the second largest exporter  to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems  illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt  have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings  particularly some African nations and Colombia  are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas  analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year  producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31  but the full council is not due to meet again until September  delegates said."
"2","European Community (EC) farm ministersearly today abandoned talks aimed at saving an agreement on cutting excessive milk production after making no progress in over 12 hours of negotiations. The ministers will resume talks at 10.00 local time in a bid to clear the way for a full-scale review of proposed reforms for other surplus sectors. Diplomats said member states were unable to settle differences over new rules limiting farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted butter at high guaranteed prices into EC cold stores. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to the steps."
"2","Earthquakes and aftershocks are stillshaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3 000 people homeless. Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT). No casualties have been reported and no further major damage  civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km  the seismologist added. A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force  with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe  Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted. Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale. The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks  declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared  with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired. Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference of foreign ministers. A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when the buildings are declared safe."
"2","Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices  and on calculations gilt prices will firm  bond managers said. Japanese  British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains  including city and trust banks  which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market  they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger  the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand  major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year  traders said. These investors  who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases  appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo  a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today  up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However  gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates  they said.  The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds  suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here   said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct  against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London."
"2","Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record  senior economists  including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan  said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.  There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment   said Takashi Kiuchi  senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government  which published the January unemployment figures today  did not make any predictions.  At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year  but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving   a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries  such as cars and textiles  have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring  economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down  said Koichi Tsukihara  Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However  other economists disagreed  saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations  methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare  economists warned.  The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used   one economist said. More than half of January's 170 000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24  Sumitomo's Tsukihara said."
"2","Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea  Hong Kong and Singapore  a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period  it said. Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end. Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year. The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985  official figures show. Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986  the same figures show. Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner  after electrical and electronic products. Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs."
"2","Singapore's Finance Minister RichardHu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1  bankers and economists told Reuters. They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986  indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985  the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct  and income tax was reduced by the same margin. Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme  the Central Provident Fund (CPF)  to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.  I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving   said Clemente Escano  vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The government's economic report for calendar 1986  issued last week  said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce  financial  and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. The sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87  but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure  helped by the wage-freeze policy. Anthony K.P. Lee  vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express Bank Ltd  said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. Lee said   It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support.  Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction  so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget  economists said. The economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further decline is expected in 1987. But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988  so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth  including incentives to families who have three children. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families  instead of the two-child families it encourages now."
"2","The Philippines must devalue the peso ifit wants its exports to remain competitive  Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.  The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive   Monsod said an interview.  No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan  South Korea  West Germany  Japan  all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.  The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance.  If the dollar rate goes higher  our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher  so the financing is very difficult   she said.  But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.  She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.  I'm just saying  keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.  Monsod said   The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing.  Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984."
"2","Zaire agreed to limit its tinexports to 1 736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports  the ATPC said. ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96 000 tonnes for a year from March 1. Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1 900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987  and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1 200 tonnes. The ATPC hopes to cut the 70 000-tonne world surplus by 20 000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7 000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year. The ATPC consists of Malaysia  Indonesia  Thailand  Bolivia  Australia  Nigeria and Zaire. China and Bolivia  important producers of tin  are not members."

"2","The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday  as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks  money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact  from which funds will be credited on Thursday  when an earlier pact expires  draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday  because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday  and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic  making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week  and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.  I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little  to say 14 or 15 billion marks   one dealer said.  They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer   he added. An earlier pact expires next week  draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank  averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month  just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

"2","Britain's gold and currency reservesshowed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February  after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January  the Treasury said. The underlying trend  which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges  is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs  after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month  after 163 mln in January  while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln  a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January  capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs  with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations  but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman  commenting on the reserves figures  said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels. He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting."

"2","West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems  senior West German banking sources said. The sources  speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg  also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  who met Funaro yesterday. Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt  which totals some 109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening. Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund. However  the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a  rapprochement  with the IMF.  Consultations are the least that can be expected   said one banker. Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982. Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks  holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt  were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks  involving separate discussions with the regions. Such a move would be in Brazil's interest  since European banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions  such as interest capitalisation. The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach  saying:  There must be one committee and one solution.  But he added:  There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account.  German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered.  The menu must become richer   the banker said. Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States  because of their lower exposure. According to Bundesbank data from September last year  West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit."
"2","President Corazon Aquino announcedgovernment plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24 billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the sale of failed businesses taken over by the government. Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugar estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.  Whatever laws will be enacted  I say that nobody is above the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are enacted as far as sugar land is concerned   she told reporters. A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan  including the question of whether land operated by multinational companies should also be covered  she added. Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform programme. The plan  requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs  now also covers sugar and coconut areas  apart from rice and corn lands  he said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless peasants  he added. Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break up her family's 6 000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of the most pressing problems facing the Philippines. It was not known whether government would wait for the Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or have Aquino carry it out through an executive order. Under the plan  government will purchase land mainly from landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50 000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos."

"2","Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record  senior economists  including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan  said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.  There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment   said Takashi Kiuchi  senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government  which published the January unemployment figures today  did not make any predictions.  At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year  but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving   a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries  such as cars and textiles  have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring  economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down  said Koichi Tsukihara  Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However  other economists disagreed  saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years."
"2","Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices  and on calculations gilt prices will firm  bond managers said. Japanese  British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains  including city and trust banks  which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market  they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger  the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand  major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year  traders said. These investors  who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases  appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo  a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today  up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However  gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates  they said.  The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds  suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here   said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct  against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London."
"2","Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker  a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal  will serve a third term  sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment  which must be filled this August  has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan  who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement  was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker  first appointed in 1979 by President Carter  will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration  Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker  kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay  the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story  quickly shot down by others in the administration  that Beryl Sprinkel  chairman of the council of economic advisers  had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire  it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican  Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.  This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get   said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question  Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership  foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry  but recent statements by Volcker  in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation  signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw  exactly eye-to-eye  on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985  he decided to ensure a good working relationship  in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan  Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term  was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker  whose political skills undermined that ambition  and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay.  Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise   said one.  He'd have to be asked   said Stephen Axilrod  formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise  the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut  he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous  coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor  therefore  would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz  whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal  while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan  frequently an informal presidential economic adviser  New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman  and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege  Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House."
"2","Employers and the port union  FNV  areto meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector  but neither side is optimistic  spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks  with both sides largely reiterating their positions.  There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV  and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking   a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman  Jacques Schoufour  accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.  The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all.   If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector  then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month   Schoufour said. The series of strikes  which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks  began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4 000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases  but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest."
"2","This morning's sharp decline in coffeeprices  following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization  ICO  quotas  will be short-lived  Dutch roasters said.  The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas  but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again   a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.  The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present  there is a shortage of quality   he said.  Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks   the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction  it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.  There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement   he said.  There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation   de Vries added. With this in mind  and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover  the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb  roasters said."
"2","Earthquakes and aftershocks are stillshaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3 000 people homeless. Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT). No casualties have been reported and no further major damage  civil defence sources said. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks  declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out."
"2","Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea  Hong Kong and Singapore  a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall."
"2","The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year  and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit  President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament  Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct  compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985  he added.  But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result  we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year   he said. The price of coffee  Kenya's main source of foreign exchange  fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil  which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel  has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes  coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world  made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history  he added.  This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts  and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development   he said.  It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs   the president added."
"2","Winter wheat crops in thewestern Soviet Union  Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two nights  private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said. Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Snow cover is scant in Poland  with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning. The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover  making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night  but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures expected to fall to near 0 degrees F over the next two nights  some light winterkill is possible  Accu-Weather added."
"2","Three black workers were killed andseven injured in fighting at a South African zinc refinery last night  Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd said. The company said two groups of workers began attacking each other at about 1000 local time with machetes  knives and sticks at a hostel at the Zincor plant  some 40 kms east of Johannesburg. It said the fighting was  quelled  after 25 minutes by its own security staff. Police were called but the fighting had ended by the time they arrived. A company spokesman said he had no idea of the cause of the fighting. An investigation was underway  he said."
"2","The Federal Reserve is expected toenter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves  economists said. They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via System repurchases. Federal funds  which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday  opened at 6-3/16 pct and stayed there in early trading. Analysts said the rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25 billion dlrs of five-year Treasury notes."
"2","U.S. Carmaker General Motors hopes tosell between 7 000 and 8 000 vehicles in Europe this year  a five-fold rise over the year before  James Fry  vice-president of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation told a news briefing.  The low dollar makes our prices very attractive   he said at a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.  We would like to sell between 7 000 and 8 000 units in Europe for the year to August 1987   he told Reuters later. Officials said GM sold 1 500 vehicles in the 1986 model year. Fry said that at an average price of 13 000 dlrs  his projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln and 104 mln dlrs in Europe. GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500 vehicles  due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the then strong dollar  Fry said. All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the United States and Canada  he said  adding that most sales were in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany."
"2","The collapse of International CoffeeOrganization  ICO  talks on export quotas yesterday removes the immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the customs service to monitor coffee imports  analysts here said. The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.). However  the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not immediately needed  one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.  You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now) this is an urgent issue   the coffee analyst said."
"2","Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community  EC  on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil  averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States. De Croo  in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders  said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries. But he added   I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe   adding  so there will be a compromise.  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax  the United States would respond  vigorously  to protect its trade rights and access to community markets. De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States. U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards. He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle  which is also opposed by the United States. De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1  1988. He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule."
"2","Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pctof the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt  President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders. Speaking last night at a new session of congress  he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image.  Our priority is development  but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations   he said. Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.  The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year   Lusinchi said. He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had  decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case  because of the vulnerability of its economy.  Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February  1986  but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income  which dropped 40 pct last year. Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter  but that in any case it would become effective from April 1. Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement  and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support. Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation. He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela  a fundamental achievement in the new accord.  Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing   he said  adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise."
"2","Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a newcompany with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project  an official communique said. The communique was issued after two days of talks here between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa. Originally  Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved  but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets. Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study. This would be completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank  which is also expected to give financial support. Production  originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year  will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990. On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in Guinea  the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions  it would be extended to cover exploration for gold  diamonds  cobalt  nickel and silver."
"2","A World Bank team led by senioreconomist Katrine Saito arrived in Uganda for talks on an economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs over three years. The four-member mission is expected to stay two to three weeks. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is due here over the same period  a World Bank offical said. The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on deficit financing and exchange and interest rates  issues likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery program. Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating industries  repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors and other agricultural needs. He did not say where the money would come from  but diplomats expect the government to ask the World Bank and other foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion."
